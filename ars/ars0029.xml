            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Hall Martin Collection consists of open reel tape recordings of iconic speeches from 20th century political and historical figures, particularly Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. The tapes were recorded from radio and television broadcasts, as well as a few recordings, by Hall Martin (B.A. 1935, M.A. 1950), an instructor and assistant professor in Stanford's Speech and Drama Department from 1955 to 1963. These tapes were likely made available for study by students; in fact a speech by President Truman is identified as being an example of poor public speaking.</p>            
<p>The collection also includes proceedings from the 1961 Northwest Drama Conference at Stanford. Martin was involved in the planning and staging of the conference, and he obtained Delmar Daves, a Hollywood producer and Stanford graduate, as keynote speaker. Actors Jack Lemmon and John Kerr were also participants.The Northwest Drama Conference is an annual academic theatre conference founded in 1948 and includes participants from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, Nevada, Western Montana, and Northern California. The conference was hosted by Stanford from February 9th-11th, 1961, with the theme being "American Theatre: The Challenge of the Surging Sixties."</p>
