            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The Stanford Music Broadcast Tapes Collection consists of recordings on 172 open reel tapes, made from 1951 to 1969. All material appears to have been recorded locally at Stanford from radio broadcasts. While the vast majority are of classical music and opera performances, a few recordings are lectures or discussions about economics. Recordings made in the 1950's are largely of the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Toscanini, Ormandy, Mitropoulos, and Cantelli, and were originally aired on local NBC affiliate KNBC. These seem to be have been made by a single individual who made notes and comments about the material on the tape box, such as a complaint about "interference from Stanford station," or "watched Toscanini on TV" (NBC also offered a television broadcast of these performances). Later recordings are of a wider variety, and include performances by the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Metropolitan Opera, with conductors including Monteaux, Munch, and Bernstein. Many tapes are accompanied by notes or newspaper clippings in their boxes.</p>

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>Each tape is numbered according to its performance date (i.e. 530131 would be January 31, 1953). Boxes are in very approximate chronological order. No full list of contents is presently available.</p>
