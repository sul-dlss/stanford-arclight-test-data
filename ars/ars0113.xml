            <p>The James H. Love Collection consists of off-air recordings from radio and television broadcasts, as well as informal home recordings of the Love family and friends. Love, who also went by Jim or J.H., spent countless hours at his home in Ventura, California listening to the radio (including stations KUSC, KPCC, KBCA, KPCC, KFAC, KPFA, and KLON) and recording programs, editing out the advertisements and adding meticulously detailed notes. He also transferred commercial releases (78s, LPs and even compact discs) to tape, and several reels contain these copies, along with the more unique content.  Programs most represented in the collection include the Keyboard Immortals series, St. Paul Sunday Morning, and the jazz show Strictly from Dixie, as well as the televised dramas Upstairs, Downstairs and No Honestly, and a few high school sports events.</p>
            <p>Among the home recordings of the Love family, there are Christmas celebrations, family reunions, family history interviews, and audio snapshots of daily life, particularly from the early 1960s. The family were also avid amateur musicians, and Love captured much of this musical activity with his microphone. James Love himself played the recorder, and there are several tapes of him playing with a recorder trio and quartet. Love was a fan of 17-19th century chamber music (he once wrote "symphonic music is ... for people who eat nothing but musical banana splits"), piano and piano rolls, as well as older jazz and pre-war pop, and this is primarily the kinds of music featured in the collection. No complete contents listing is available; however, a cursory outline of notable recordings is offered below.</p>
