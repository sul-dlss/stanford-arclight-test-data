            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">The Jack Lund Collection contains personal papers of Jack Lund as well as numerous newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, and music books. It also contains Lund's collection of classical music on 78 rpm discs, mostly in albums, 33 1/3 rpm long playing discs, and a small number of open reel tapes. The materials in this collection document the principal musical interests of Mr. Lund, i.e. vocal solo music, opera, careers and performances of specific singers and pianists, and the career of Arturo Toscanini. Since Mr. Lund mantained personal friendships with many musicians he admired, he acquired autographed photographs of these artists, and he regularly corresponded with them. The photographs and many of the letters from these musicians are included in the collection. As an avid reader of published articles and books on musical topics, Mr. Lund collected newspaper clippings and books about specific musicians, and he also corresponded with the authors of these writings. Letters received from these authors and a large number of clippings are also included in the collection. Some copies of journals and newsletters, which were included in the donated collection, have been retained in order to provide a broader context to Mr. Lund's musical interests and pursuits.</abstract>

        <bioghist id="ref3">
            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Jack H. Lund was born in San Francisco on January 10, 1913 but spent the early years of his life in Berkeley. He attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in the Class of 1935. During the Second World War he served in the army and achieved the rank of Major. Following the footsteps of his father, Jack Lund worked for the Friden Calculating Company for twenty-five years and became its Sales Promotion Manager before he retired in the 1960s. It was during Lund's retirement years that he was able to pursue his primary interests, tennis and music.</p>
            <p>As an avid follower of tennis, Jack Lund attended 31 Wimbledon championships and 25 French championships, and he maintained friendships with many of the best known American tennis stars. Lund himself played tennis with the California Tennis Club until he was 91.</p>
            <p>Jack Lund's musical interests were focused on classical music, particularly German lied and opera. He was also a great admirer of Arturo Toscanini, and in addition to attending many Toscanini concerts, he became a member of the Toscanini Society and collected significant amounts of related memorabilia. Lund built a massive record collection that featured the greatest classical singers of the time as well as performances of Toscanini. He attended many of the European music festivals and was a strong supporter of the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Through his attendance and support of musical events he established friendships with numerous prominent musicians and was particularly outgoing when musical artists came to perform in San Francisco. It was not unusual for Jack Lund to entertain his musical friends at his apartment which boasted beautiful views of the San Francisco Bay and Berkeley. He was a great admirer of Kirsten Flagstad, Gerard Souzay, and Ignaz Jan Paderewski, and he could count among his friends such singers as Aksel Schiotz, Dame Janet Baker, Elly Ameling and Jessye Norman, as well as pianist Dalton Baldwin. Lund also became friends with the esteemed French music teacher Nadia Boulanger, and at one point he sat in on her classes at Fontainebleau-- probably the only non-musician ever to do so.</p>
            <p>Although Jack Lund never considered himself to be a musician, he spent much of his time keeping himself informed about the music world through reading, concert attendance and ongoing communication with artists and record collectors. Jack Lund died on November 27, 2009, and as per his request, there was no funeral or memorial.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The Jack Lund Collection was bequeathed to Stanford University by Jack Lund, and the donation was executed by Karen L. Johnston shortly after Mr. Lund's death in 2009. The collection consists of 5345 items and a total of 570.33 linear feet. The materials document Mr. Lund's associations and friendships with a wide array of musicians in the U.S. and abroad, his activities in music organizations, and particularly his musical interests as demonstrated in the large number of recordings which he collected throughout his lifetime.</p>
            <p>All of the paper and photographic materials in this collection are described in this finding aid. All of the sound recordings are being fully cataloged separately, and the bibliographic records can be found in WorldCat and the Stanford Libraries' database. In the local Stanford database the bibliographic records for recordings in this collection include the searchable subject heading "Jack Lund Collection."</p>

                        <p>Jack Lund's library included over 150 books, primarily on musical topics. The books were checked against the Stanford Music Library's holdings, and all duplicate books in the Lund Collection were removed. All of the remaining books from the Lund Collection were retained and shelved in the Music Library.</p>
                        <p>Various clippings from newspapers and journals, letters and some photographs had been placed inside of many of the books. Those inserted materials have been removed from the books and placed in file folders each of which is labeled according to the book from which that folder's materials were taken.</p>
