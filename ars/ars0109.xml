            <p>This is a group of small collections, assembled from various donors, related to the history of the Ampex Corporation and its role in the development of sound recording on tape and stereophonic sound. Stanford University Special Collections holds the Ampex Corporation Records, and some artifacts described here are part of that collection, despite being housed at the Archive of Recorded Sound. The Ampex Corporation, founded in 1944 by Russian &#233;migr&#233; Alexander M. Poniatoff, began as military contractor making components for radar, but became a pioneer in the magnetic tape recording industry through rather unusual circumstances. In 1945, a soldier named John T. "Jack" Mullin was assigned by the U.S. Army Signal Corp to recover examples of Nazi technology from the field. In a radio station near Frankfurt, Mullin confirmed that the Germans had developed a system of sound recording and reproduction using paper and plastic tape. He returned to the United States with fifty reels of audio tape and two AEG Magnetophon brand reel-to-reel machines on which to play them. Following a successful demonstration at an Institute of Radio Engineers conference, Mullin, along with business partner Bill Palmer, approached entertainer Bing Crosby with a proposal for using audio tape in the production of his radio program Philco Radio Time. Crosby thus became the most significant early investor in Ampex's tape recording line. Mullin even worked on the Philco program himself, doing the editing using both the German tape he brought back and with other American brands then in development.</p>
            <p>The Ampex Collection Addenda includes two pages of a Philco Radio Time script, possibly with Mullin's notes on the back. The collection also includes an original Magnetophon Tonschreiber tape case with reels and parts. There are also various tapes which came from Jack Mullin via Ampex employee Jim Wheeler, some of which almost certainly came from this case, and miscellaneous tapes from the estate of C.D. (Charles Dewitt) Du Bois, an executive at Ampex beginning in the late 1950s. Finally, there are recordings made in 1998 at a gathering commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Ampex 200, the first tape recorder made by the company.</p>

                        <p>This metal case was brought to the United States by Jack Mullin from Germany in 1945, and has been identified as part of a AEG (Allgemeine-Elektrizitats-Gesellschaft) Magnetophon Tonschreiber. It measures 9.75" x 11.5" x 17" and has "Ton S.b. 1 (Zubehor)" printed on the top. The case held open reel tapes and supplies, and apparently fit next to the actual reel-to-reel player. Inside there are slots for 10" reels. In three slots there are two reels in metal cases and one reel with German writing. No tape is on the reels (see the Mullin tapes for what may be them). There is also a compartment on one side for tools and supplies, including rubber rollers and vacuum tubes (there are two Telefunken LS50s and several smaller tubes in padded holes). A powerful vinegar smell persists, even after seventy years.</p>
