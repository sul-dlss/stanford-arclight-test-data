            <p>The Issei Oral History Project in Watsonville was created by historian Kazuko Nakane
                in preparation for the book Nothing Left in my Hands : The Issei of a Rural
                California Town, 1900-1942. Interviews were conducted in Japanese by Nakane from
                1978 to 1983 with fifteen Japanese-American residents in Watsonville, California.
                Located in the Pajaro Valley, Watsonville and the surrounding area is
                overwhelmingly agricultural, and farming is a major topic discussed in the
                interviews. Other subjects include the impact of anti-immigration legislation,
                relocation camps during World War II, and the difficulty in maintaining relations
                with family still in Japan. The collection contains the original audiocassettes of
                these interviews, as well as transcripts in English.</p>

                        <p>Interview of Yoshito Kadotani and his wife, Kimiyo Kadotani. It is mostly
                            a biography of Yoshito, with brief contributions from Kimiyo. Yoshito
                            Kadotani was born in July 10, Meiji 36 [1903] in Yashiro, Oshima-cho,
                            Oshima-gun, Yamaguchi Prefecture to Taro Kadotani (father) and Hanako
                            Kadotani (mother). (Names given as First name, Last name.)</p>
                        <p>Yoshito came to the United States with his mother when he was 4 years old
                            to join his father, who worked as a gardener in Watsonville, CA.
                            Yoshito's family relocated to Santa Cruz when he was 5 years old, and
                            has lived there ever since. Yoshito has two younger sisters and a
                            younger brother, who were all born in Santa Cruz, CA.</p>
                        <p>Yoshito's younger sister, Kiyoko Okahara is married and lives in Japan.
                            Yoshito's younger brother, Kiyotaka Kadotani, is in the United States.
                            Yoshito's youngest sister, Mieko Fujimura, is also in United States.
                            From age 6, Yoshito attended Laurel Elementary School in Santa Cruz
                            until he returned to Japan at the age of 10. He came back to United
                            States when he was 19 years old in 1921 and graduated from Santa Cruz
                            High School on Walnut Avenue in 1925.</p>
                        <p>There are 24-25 Japanese families in Santa Cruz around this time. There
                            was a correspondent who wrote a column about Watsonville in the
                            ""Shinsekai"" newspaper in San Francisco. His name was Samonji
                            Takeda.</p>
                        <p>Yoshito started as a gardener, then worked as a landscape designer. On
                            Feb. 22, 1942, with the United States at war with Japan, Yoshito was
                            taken into custody by the FBI, the head of the local police department
                            and a sergeant who came to Yoshito's house in Santa Cruz.</p>
                        <p>Yoshito was the clerk of the Japanese Association in Santa Cruz at that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The head of the Japanese Association in Santa Cruz, Mr. Tsumoru Kai, was
                            also taken into custody. Yoshito's younger brother, Kiyotaka, who was
                            visiting Mr. Kai by chance, was also taken into custody but later
                            released since he had citizenship. From Santa Cruz, Yoshito was sent to
                            North Dakota, then Louisiana, then Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
                        <p>During his time in Camp Livingston, Louisiana, he met Kazuo Sakamaki, who
                            is famous as the first prisoner of war. In the Santa Fe camp, Yoshito
                            applied to join a road work project in Idaho and was accepted. After a
                            hearing, he was released in April 1943 and returned to Arizona, where
                            his sisters and brother were living. He then went to Chicago to work at
                            the Family Welfare Office of the local internment camp. He returned to
                            Santa Cruz after the war.</p>
                        <p>Yoshito married Kimiyo in March 12, 1949. They have two adopted
                            daughters. He received his U.S. citizenship on Feb. 14, 1956.</p>

                            daughter is Yasuko, who was born on November 12, 1925 and currently
                            lives in LA. Their second daughter, Teruko, passed away on May 24, 1972
                            due to acute pneumonia. Their oldest son, Eiji, died when he was 2 ½
                            years old. Their second son, George, was born in November, 1932. Their
                            3rd daughter, Setsuko, was born on July 27, 1935. She passed away when
                            she was 4 years and 9 months old. Their 3rd son, Bill, was born on July
                            2, 1939, and lives in Watsonville. Their 4th son, Ronald (Masao is his
                            Japanese name), was born Feb. 16, 1942. Their youngest daughter, Sandra
                            (her Japanese name is Toshiko), was born in camp on July 25, 1945, and
                            is a nurse in San Jose. Their 5th son, Robert, was born Feb. 26, 1948,
                            and lives in Texas. They moved to Camp #1 in Poston, Arizona on May 17,
                            1942. Mr. Kajihara worked as a cook during this time. After camp, they
                            stayed in Glendale, Arizona for a year then moved to Texas and farmed in
                            Presidio in the lowlands. They cultivated cantaloupe in the summer. They
                            came to Watsonville at the end of July 1953 and worked on a strawberry

                        <p>TAPE2: He applied his citizenship after it was allowed in 1952. His
                            brother-in-law, who was a commissioned officer in the Japanese army,
                            encouraged his return to Japan, and his parents suggested to send Mr.
                            Kizuka’s children to Japan to get educated there, Mr. Kuzuka had no
                            intention of separating from his children; he did not want to his
                            children raised without own parents like he did.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shuro Kobayashi was born Nov. 25, 1886. His family owned a dry goods
                            store (gofukuya) called Aburaya in Shimotsuma-shi, Ibaraki prefecture.
                            Mr. Kobayashi was the youngest son. He had two sisters and three
                            brothers. Two brothers came to the United States. His oldest brother,
                            Kyutaro Nakamura, was adopted by another family. The second brother’s
                            name is Minekichi Kobayashi, and the third is Eizo Kobayashi. His
                            brother-in-law, a member of the Ibaraki prefectural assembly, called him
                            “Shuro” (守郎).</p>
                        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Kobayashi had just celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary
                            three days prior to the second interview.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Masa Kobayashi (maiden name: Kujirai) is from Shimotsuma-shi,
                            Ibaraki prefecture and comes from a family of well-to-do landowners.
                            Mrs. Kobayashi was sent to Tokyo for her education. Her father later
                            lost his fortune in the stock market.</p>

                        <p>Interview condcuted at interviewee’s home. The entire interview was
                            conducted in English. Margaret (Mr. Hoy Lew’s wife) was also there and
                            sometimes assisted with the interview.</p>
                        <p>Hoy was born in Taishan county, Guangdong, China. Birthday: Sept. 29,
                            1896. At the time of the interview, he was 85 years old. Hoy came to the
                            United States in Dec. 1912 at the age of 16. He arrived in San Francisco
                            and stayed on Angel Island for 11 days. Hoy thinks he was lucky, since
                            he knows many people who had to stay on Angel Island much longer than
                            that, some as long as a year. Hoy came to the United States with his
                            father, who had been living in the United States but went back to China
                            to bring Hoy with him. Mother was still in China, and joined them in the
                            United States later. Hoy has three brothers and one sister. His old
                            brother was already in the United States. His sister and two younger
                            brothers were still in China. They all came later to the United States,
                            and eventually Hoy had his entire family with him. Hoy hasn’t been back
                            to China since. Hoy moved to Watsonville in 1913 after staying in San
                            Francisco for a few months. When Hoy came to Watsonville, there were
                            only about ten Chinese families there. Hoy’s father had a grocery store
                            that supplied Chinese groceries to the community. Hoy’s father’s grocery
                            store was among the few of its kind. Hoy worked at his father’s store.
                            In the Watsonville and Aromas area, there were about 20 apple-drying
                            plants owned by Chinese people.</p>
                        <p>About Hoy’s experience at the apple-drying plant. They gathered
                            second-grade (bruised) apples from apple-packing plants.During 1920-23,
                            due to the depression, more than half of the small apple-drying
                            businesses closed.</p>
                        <p>About the gambling house/ Hoy doesn’t know much about the gambling house,
                            nor the prostitution houses. He talks about how the Chinese community
                            shifted from farming to owning small businesses such as grocery
                            stores.</p>
                        <p>He received his US citizenship after WWII.</p>

                        <p>Mrs. Chizu Matsuoka was born in Kurouhara, Sente Village, Kaho-gun in
                            Fukuoka Prefecture on February 16, 1902. Mr. Matsuoka’s father-in-law
                            and her father are cousins. She received an education equivalent to
                            present-day junior high school in Japan. After graduation, she left for
                            Hakata and worked as an apprentice nurse at a hospital in Fukuoka-shi
                            during the day. She took classes to be a midwife at night. After passing
                            the test to be a midwife, she began working as an apprentice nurse in
                            the hospital at a Mitsubishi coal mine. After she passed the test to
                            become a nurse, her future husband came back from the United States and
                            they got married. She was 23 years old then. It was a rather late age
                            for a woman to marry in those days. Since they were relatives, their
                            marriage was arranged by their parents before her future husband came
                            back. In order to avoid the draft in Japan, they hurried to get married
                            and left for the U.S. at the end of January or beginning of February,
                            1924. Mrs. Matsuoka’s husband, Tonai Matsuoka, was born November 15,
                            1892 (Meiji 25). He also finished his kotoka education in Japan. He was
                            called by his parents in 1908 at the age of 16 to the United States. In
                            Watsonville, Tonai operated “Yokohama Laundry” on Main Street in
                            partnership with other Japanese. Mrs. Matsuoka received a license to be
                            a midwife in 1925. She was the only Japanese among the examinees. She
                            opened a maternity hospital at her house. Mr. and Mrs. Matsuoka had two
                            children. At the time of the war, they were 15 and 12 years old. They
                            were all sent to Camp #2 in Poston, Arizona. She worked as a doctor’s
                            assistant in the camp. They came back to Watsonville in 1945, where Mr.
                            Matsuoka started a gardening business. Both of them received citizenship
                            around 1954 or 1955.</p>

                        <p>The interviewees are Mr. Kumajiro Murakami and Mrs. Fuji Murakami. Mr.
                            Kumajiro Murakami was born March 3, 1881 to a farming family in
                            Saga-mura, Yamaguchi prefecture. He left Japan at the age of 17, and
                            lived in Hawaii for five years. He had seven brothers and sisters. He
                            was the second son. He came to Hawaii with his friends and worked on a
                            sugarcane farm. However, due to unsuccessful farming, he came to
                            Watsonville to join his older brother and a brother-in-law, who were
                            growing strawberries. Their parents arranged their marriage on May 13,
                            1909. Mrs. Fuji Murakami was born April 21, 1888, also to a farming
                            family in Yamaguchi prefecture. She had four brothers and sisters. Mrs.
                            Murakami is the second daughter. She came to Watsonville when she was 21
                            years old. They had five children together (two boys and three girls).
                            The grey strawberries in Watsonville. During the war, since all of their
                            children were married and not with them, only Mr. &amp; Mrs. Murakami
                            went to Salinas and then to Poston, Arizona, Camp #2. One son was
                            drafted as a solder, while the other son left early for Chicago. After
                            camp, Mr. and Mrs. Murakami went to Chicago to join their son for two to
                            three years. After that, they returned to Watsonville. They recollect
                            that thanks to the police presence and pro-Japanese American neighbors,
                            their house remained the way it was. They resumed growing
                            strawberries.</p>

                        <p>The interviewee’s name is Mr. Toshisuke Murata. Mr. Murata changed his
                            name to “Toshi” Murata when he became a naturalized citizen of the
                            United States. Mr. Toshisuke Murata was born Jan. 10, Meiji 40 (1907) in
                            Hidaka-gun, Hidaka-cho, Ikeda, Wakayama prefecture. His father, Yasutaro
                            Murata, was a rice farmer. His mother’s name is Riki. All together, he
                            has seven brothers and sisters. He was the youngest son. Four of them
                            came to the United States. Mr. Yasutaro Murata arrived first in 1906 or
                            1907, around the time Mr. Toshi Murata was born. Mr. Yasutaro Murata
                            worked in Castroville, CA as a farmer, growing sugar beets and peas. Mr.
                            Toshi Murata came to the United States in 1921 at the age of 14. He was
                            sent to the Angel Island immigration office and stayed there for one
                            night. Mr. Toshi Murata’s mother never joined her husband and sons in
                            the United States. His older brother, Shigeru, came to the United States
                            four years before Mr. Toshi Murata to join their father. His other
                            brother, Masazo, also joined his father in the United States. Two of
                            four sisters came to the United States and married here. Mr. Toshi
                            Murata’s father returned to Japan in 1923. After that, his brother and
                            Mr. Toshi Murata moved to Watsonville to join their other relatives. He
                            was only 16 or 17 at the time, but already determined to settle in the
                            United States. Mr. Toshi Murata went to Salinas in 1936. Before that, he
                            drove a truck in Watsonville from 1929 to 1932. He married his wife, who
                            was born in Salinas, in 1941 – the year the war started. They don’t have
                            any children.</p>
                        <p>When the war began, Mr. and Mrs. Murata, along with Mrs. Murata’s
                            parents, her two sisters and her younger brother, all moved to the
                            temporary camp in Salinas for two months. Then, they moved to Camp #2 in
                            Poston, Arizona. They came back to Watsonville in 1945 and worked in the
                            apple orchards packing fruit. After that, he was employed at a lettuce
                            company. He received his American citizenship in 1952.</p>

                        <head>Summary of conversation</head>
                        <p>Name: Nakamura Kokichi. Place of origin: Kagoshima-ken Kawanabe-gun
                            Chiran-cho Kadonoura. Birthday: Dec. 25, 1898 (Meiji 31).</p>
                        <p>He’s the second son of four sons. His eldest brother, Nakamura Heikichi,
                            is 8 years senior to Kokichi. His two younger brothers are Iekichi and
                            Harukichi. There’s a six-year age difference between Kokichi and
                            Iekichi, and another six years between Iekichi and Heikichi. There were
                            several other brothers, but his mother suffered some miscarriages and
                            some of his brothers died very young. His parents fished and farmed.
                            Kokichi came to the United States for the first time in 1919. His eldest
                            brother came to the United States four years before, when he was 27
                            years old. He came because there was no work in Kagoshima. His other
                            brothers soon followed, along with about 120 people from his hometown.
                            His eldest brother came to downtown Los Angeles. Since he couldn’t speak
                            English, he worked as a gardener and went to night school to learn the
                            language. He was still gardening when Kokichi came. Kokichi lived in
                            Kagoshima Prefecture until he was 12 years old, when he went to Taiwan.
                            He finished school in Taiwan. After that, he taught in Taiwan until he
                            turned 17. Then, Kokichi became ill and went back to Japan.</p>
                        <p>After he recovered from his illness, Kokichi came to the United States at
                            the age of 19. He didn’t speak English. He got a job as a truck driver
                            at night and took acting lessons during the day, so he didn't have time
                            to go to night school like his brother. From 8 a.m. until noon, he
                            attended acting school. At 1 p.m., he loaded the truck. At 6 p.m., he
                            brought the cargo to the market and worked until midnight. From midnight
                            until 3 a.m., he sold his goods at the market. After that, he went home
                            to sleep, waking up in time for his acting lessons. During those times
                            he slept very little. On Saturdays, he slept until 9 am and then taught
                            in a Japanese Saturday school. On Sundays, as he’s a Christian, he
                            taught in Sunday school. That was his life until he got married 10 years
                            after he arrived in the United States. He got married in Japan in an
                            arranged marriage and at the time of the interview they had recently
                            celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in Los Angeles. His wife was
                            from the town next to his hometown and didn’t have any reservations
                            about coming to the United States. But since Kokichi was into acting,
                            which is not known as a stable job, her family was worried about her.
                            His wife is 8 years younger. At the time of the interview, she was 77
                            years old. When she married Kokichi, she was 21 or 22. She went to
                            school in Japan. Kokichi came to Los Angeles via a ship called the
                            Kasato-maru. At that time, only 4,000-5,000 Japanese were living in Los
                            Angeles. There was an active Japanese association that held picnics, New
                            Year’s gatherings, etc. The second time Kokichi came to the United
                            States, he was with his wife and used a ship called Shunyo-maru. They
                            heard the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor from the radio. Rao Shinpo
                            and Kashu Mainichi also reported the news. After Pearl Harbor, they left
                            for Denver for the voluntary evacuation with their two daughters, ages
                            11 and 9 at the time.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the interview, the older daughter was 50 and living in Los
                            Angeles, where she owned a flower boutique. The younger daughter was 48
                            and living in Watsonville. As there were no Japanese groceries available
                            in Denver, he and his wife started a business to supply Japanese food
                            (fermented bean paste, soy sauce, etc) to the camp.They hired 100
                            Japanese people to work with them. Most of them either lived in Denver
                            or moved there for the voluntary relocation. He also hired people from
                            the camp who were from the same hometown. On his most profitable days,
                            his business made $4,000 per day. He didn’t experience any prejudice in
                            building his business and has never experienced prejudice at all in the
                            United States. He stayed in Denver from the beginning of the war until
                            the end, altogether 5-6 years. In his experience, the camp was very
                            good. They fed the Japanese whatever they needed, and some loved it so
                            much they later said they wished they could go back. In his opinion,
                            camp life was luxurious. Every three months or so, the wife of President
                            Roosevelt came to visit them. However, Poston Camp No. 1, compared with
                            other camps, was not very good. They offered no mush or fruits for the
                            meals. The food service was not good. It was the Japanese food servers’
                            fault. They did not distribute food equally and, as a result, the meal
                            situation was very bad. Kokichi’s company only provided food to the
                            camp. He never got involved with clothing. After the war, he took $5,000
                            from the government as compensation. With the $5,000, he went to the
                            Watsonville. He had lots of childhood friends there, and heard
                            strawberry farming was profitable. He didn’t make any money, so he
                            opened an import/export business. As Japan was so poor, he went to
                            Kagoshima and created a Satsumayaki (Satsuma pottery) company to ship
                            pottery to the United States. It didn’t do well. Then, in Kumamoto, he
                            created a togarashi (hot pepper) company, and it was successful. His
                            business attitude is to respect whoever he is dealing with and not to
                            put too much weight on making money. This attitude comes from his faith.
                            He turned to Christianity when he was sick in Taiwan and his faith
                            helped to heal him. He likes the United States better, but he tries to
                            help Japan as he still considers himself to be Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Kokichi has a column in Kashu Mainichi, which he has been writing in for
                            30 years.</p>
                        <p>He had 8 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren (11 years old is oldest)
                            at the time of interview. One of his grandsons died in the Vietnam
                            War.</p>

                        <head>Summary of conversation</head>
                        <p>Interview of Kyuzaburo Sakata, a successful farmer and a businessman by
                            his son, Frank Sakata. The interviewee, Mr. Frank Sakai, went to school
                            in Lompoc, CA. He finished grammar school and high school in
                            Watsonville, then majored in economics at San Jose State College. This
                            interview is about his father, Kyuzaburo Sakata. Kyuzaburo Sakata was
                            born February 4, 1885 in Hidaka-gun, Wakayama-ken. Kyuzaburo passed away
                            on Aug. 23, 1971, at the age of 86. In 1908, a Jewish business friend
                            gave him the name Harry, so he began to use the name “H.K. Sakata” on
                            some occasions. Kyuzaburo was the oldest son among three brothers and
                            two sisters. His family farmed and fished. He asked his parents to let
                            him go to the U.S. and they gave in when he was 15 years old, allowing
                            him to go to Steveston, British Columbia, Canada to join his uncle. He
                            stayed with his uncle for two years, then came to the United States in
                            1902 to join his fellow villagers in Lompoc, CA. He was a common farm
                            laborer at first. Later, he became a partner with his two of his cousins
                            and farmed with them on a share arrangement. They did well and were able
                            to buy twenty acres of land before the Alien Land Law was enacted in
                            1913. He married a sister of one of his cousins in 1910. Her name is
                            Tomie Ishida Sakata, and she was born in May 1892. At the time of their
                            marriage, he was 28 and she was 20. He sold the land to an American man
                            at an excellent value. His two cousins went home to Japan with quite a
                            substantial amount of money. Kyuzaburo then relocated to Watsonville in
                            Dec. 1917. He received legal advice from attorney Guy C. Calden
                            suggesting that he could circumvent the land law by forming a
                            corporation. The L &amp; W Company was organized, bought land, and began
                            farming in 1918. Their association lasted until Mr. Calden’s death.
                            Kyuzaburo had business partnership with M. A. Travers from 1925 to 1937.
                            He became a citizen in 1953, one year after it was allowed for the
                            Japanese.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shikuma was born in 1907 in Monterey County. This interview is mostly
                            about his father, Mr. Unosuke Shikuma, who was a successful businessman.
                            Mr. Unosuke Shikuma was born in Shinjo-mura, Yamaguchi-ken. He was born
                            April 13, 1884 (Meiji 17). He came to the United States when he was
                            about 18 years old. He went to Christian Mission School, where they
                            taught English to Japanese people in Watsonville. He worked as a
                            strawberry farmer. Mr. Unosuke Shikuma was taken by the FBI to the local
                            police station for questioning in March after the war broke out. Since
                            everyone had to leave for Poston, Arizona, they transferred their
                            businesses to their Italian partner, Mr. Tomasello, with whom they
                            farmed before the war. Mr. Unosuke Shikuma passed away on Jan. 4,
                            1969.</p>

                        <p>This is an interview with Yuki Torigoe. It contains her biographical
                            information as well as that of her husband, Bunkichi Torigoe. Yuki
                            Torigoe was born on Feb. 19, 1896 (Meiji 29). She was 12 years younger
                            than her husband. Bunkichi Torigoe was born July 16, Meiji 17 (1884) in
                            Kurashiki, Okayama prefecture. Bunkichi, the first-born son, had a
                            younger brother and sister. He came to United States when he was 15
                            years and 7 months old. He arrived first in Vancouver, then came down to
                            Seattle and went to North Dakota to work for the railroad. After that,
                            he moved to San Francisco, where he worked in a kitchen assisting the
                            cook. When he was about 20 years old, he moved to Watsonville. The
                            following year, Bunkichi started a grocery store called “Hokoku Shokai”
                            in Salinas with five or six Japanese friends, which eventually went
                            bankrupt. During this period, Bunkichi taught himself to repair watches,
                            bicycles and motorcycles. When he was 23, with the bankruptcy of the
                            “Hokoku Shokai” grocery store, he opened his own grocery store. He sold
                            bicycles and motorcycles and fixed watches on the side. He managed the
                            store by himself. His younger brother and younger sister came to U.S. as
                            well. Yuki Torigoe also came from a farming family. They cultivated
                            igusa, which they used to weave “kaen,” or Hanamushiro (goza
                            mattresses). Yuki has one older sister and one younger brother in Imai,
                            Kibi-gun, Japan. Bunkichi was a relative, although not a blood relative
                            as Bunkichi’s grandfather was adopted into the family. Yuki came to the
                            U.S. by herself when she was 18 years old in 1914. She had never met
                            Bunkichi before their marriage. Bunkichi was 30 years old at that time.
                            Bunkichi had been married before to a mail-order bride. Yuki and
                            Bunkichi had four children, two boys and two girls. The oldest daughter
                            was born in 1915 and their second daughter, who lives in Japan now, is
                            named Toyoko and was born in 1917. The oldest daughter teaches Japanese
                            in Castroville. Their oldest son, Setsuo, was born in 1918 and is a
                            dentist in San Jose, and their second son, Kenji was born in May 1926
                            and is a dentist in Campbell. Due to the bad economy, Yuki went back to
                            Japan in 1918 when she was 23 years old and took three of her children
                            to get them educated. Setsuo and Yuki went back to the United States
                            after two years, but the daughters stayed behind in Kurashiki with
                            Yuki’s parents. After they graduated from Katahira Kenkyuka women’s high
                            school, Yuki called them back to the U.S., since Yuki’s father passed
                            away. Setsuo went to university in St. Louis, and war broke out during
                            his third year. Bunkichi was taken to an interment camp in North Dakota
                            immediately after Pearl Harbor since he had sold guns. Yuki, her two
                            daughters and nieces, and friends all went to voluntary evacuation in
                            Colorado in February, 1942. They went to Daiko Danchi ranch in the
                            country. Their second son was 16 years old and still in high school.
                            After he finished high school, he was drafted to fight in the 442nd
                            Regiment. Their older son, Setsuo, was in dental school in St. Louis for
                            two years, then opened his practice in Colorado. They were still in
                            Colorado after the war ended. Yuki came back to Watsonville in 1948 to
                            find everything in their store stolen. They did not submit a claim of
                            compensation to the U.S. government since Bunkichi said it was too hard
                            to list everything he had lost. They opened a new store in 1948 in
                            Watsonville. Bunkichi managed his store (Torigoe store, on Main Street)
                            until his death in 1970. He received his US citizenship in 1952. Yuki
                            didn’t receive hers, since she still had land and a house in Japan.</p>

                        <p>The interviewee is Mrs. Eiko Tsuyuki. Her father, Takejiro Okuhara, was
                            born in Kumage-gun, Yamaguchi prefecture, to a family of farmers. Being
                            a second son, he didn’t have any land of his own, so he went to Canada,
                            where he worked for a lumber company. Mrs. Tsuyuki was born in
                            Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1903 but was sent to Japan for
                            her education at the age of 5. Since her uncle and aunt had no children,
                            they took care of her and raised her. Her uncle is her father’s twin
                            brother.</p>
                        <p>She had no memory of her mother, Katsu Tsuyuki, who died in Vancouver
                            when she was 9 years old and still living in Japan. She has one brother
                            and one sister who passed away by the time of the interview.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Tsuyuki went to United States when she was 18 years old, in 1921,
                            when she married. Her first husband, Kyosuke Kishimura, was born in
                            Kuga-gun, Yamaguchi prefecture. Mr. Kishimura came to Japan to get
                            married and to take his wife to the United States. The marriage was
                            arranged by a go-between (baishaku kekkon). Her neighbors, the
                            Matsumotos, arranged the marriage.</p>
                        <p>The couple went to Watsonville, CA in 1922. He packed apples in the
                            winter and, in the summer, he worked on Mr. Unosuke Shikuma’s farm in
                            Watsonville. Mr. Kishimura was a half-share tenant farmer and grew
                            strawberries and tomatoes. In April 1942, they went to a temporary camp
                            in Salinas. On July 4, 1942, they were sent to Camp #2 in Poston,
                            Arizona.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kishimoto and Mrs. Tsuyuki had two daughters. During their stay in
                            camp, Mr. Kishimoto, who had angina pectoris, died after suffering a
                            heart attack. Right after her husband died, her older daughter, who was
                            20 years old, moved out of camp by herself and worked on the East Coast.
                            After she found a job and worked there for a year, she came back to camp
                            to take her mother and younger sister (Yukiko, age 12 at the time) to
                            the East Coast with her. Mrs. Tsuyuki then took the family to Detroit,
                            where she worked as a domestic helper for three years. Mrs. Tsuyuki’s
                            older daughter was engaged to a man in Watsonville, which is why they
                            returned there. Mrs. Tsuyuki’s second marriage was after the war in
                            Watsonville. Mr. Tsuyuki had been a bachelor for a long time. His
                            daughter, Mrs. Miura, asked Mrs. Tsuyuki to marry him.</p>

                        <head>Summary of conversation</head>
                        <p>Interview was conducted in English. The interviewee is Mr. Ichiro
                            Yamaguchi. Mr. Yamaguchi was the first son. He was born in Watsonville
                            on July 21, 1908, and grew up on a strawberry farm. During the war, he
                            went to Oregon to join the Sakatas, who had a ranch there. Mr.
                            Yamaguchi’s father, Masaki Yamaguchi, changed his first name from
                            Otokichi since his uncle (Otokichi Kajioka) had the same name. He came
                            from Fukui-ken in Japan and was partners in the J. S. Kosansha (Kosansha
                            was one of the Japanese farmers' companies). Masaki Yamaguchi came to
                            the United States in 1900. Masaki Yamaguchi’s marriage was listed in the
                            “Shinsekai” newspaper. He owned a car after 1915, which was rather
                            early. Masaki began growing lettuce after World War I. Ichiro and his
                            brother helped their father before and after school, and by working so
                            hard they both got pneumonia. Masaki gained US citizenship in the same
                            year he died, at the age of 100. Ichiro’s mother, Shina, became sick
                            when Ichiro was around four years old and went to San Francisco Hospital
                            (then Stanford hospital). She went back to Japan, and died there when
                            Ichiro was about 8 years old. She took two daughters (Ichiro’s sisters,
                            one a baby and other 2-3 years old) with her. Ichiro’s aunt and uncle
                            took care of them. When Masaki became sick, Ichiro was 17 or 18. Since
                            Ichiro and his brother couldn’t farm on their own, they quit the farm
                            when their lease ran out and went to work for their uncle as regular
                            employees. They called their sisters from Japan to take care of their
                            sick father and worked on the side. After six or seven years of illness,
                            the father got better and lived another fifty years. Ichiro went to
                            Carlton School. He was the first Japanese to go there. After Pearl
                            Harbor, they were moved to Salinas Assembly Center and then were sent to
                            Poston, Arizona in July 1942. In Oct. 1942, they went to work harvesting
                            sugar beets in Nebraska. Ichiro’s wife stayed in the camp. He worked for
                            Mr. Kyusaburo Sakata. Then, after the war, his brother, several of his
                            brother’s relatives, and Mr. Toshio Matsushita, bought the land from Mr.
                            Sakata. They lived in Oregon for 11 years. They came back to Watsonville
                            in 1955. He grew strawberries for a while, but went almost bankrupt.
                            Then, he worked for his neighbors, who were produce growers. After
                            working for them for 2-3 years, he went into gardening in about 1963 as
                            there was more money in gardening.</p>
