            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The W.H. Auden Collection of Sound Recordings consists of vinyl LPs, many of which were once owned by renowned poet W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, Auden's companion and artistic collaborator. Auden and Kallman lived in Greece in the early 1970s, and after Auden died in 1972, Kallman gave their record collection, along with two open reel tapes, to St. Catherine's British Embassy School in Kifissia (a suburb of Athens). Around 1995, the school decided to liquidate their record collection, and a man named Stephen Montgomery, whose wife worked at the school, rescued them. The Montgomerys returned to Abigdon, England with the collection in 1997. While making a film on Auden for the BBC in 2000, John Fuller and BBC producer Roger Thompson were put in touch with Montgomery, who offered them access to the collection. Fuller and Thompson subsequently pledged to find it a good home. Thompson donated the collection to Stanford in 2008.</p>
            <p>It is certain that records were added to the collection after its donation to the school. There are many childrens' records (some with other names and addresses written on them) and records released after Auden's death. In a sense, this might be better called the St. Catherine's Collection, since we'll never know which precisely were Auden's records. Outside of one dedication by poet Cornel Lengyel, there are no inscriptions or other markings on the records that indicate Auden's presence. The majority of records are classical music and opera, although there is one box that contains comedy, spoken word, soundtracks, and other odds and ends. The range of material is fairly wide, but limited conclusions may be drawn from the kinds of composers and performers included.</p>
            <p>Despite the lack of provenance in the collection, there are some recordings which may be safely assumed to have been Auden's. There are two 3 LP sets on the Columbia label of the opera The Rake's Progress, with music by Stravinsky and libretto by Auden and Kallman: two copies of Columbia Masterworks SL-125 from 1953 and one copy of CBS 72278-72280 from 1965. In Kallman's notes to the latter, he recounts that Stravinsky "had asked us, when the libretto was completed, whether any particular voices or timbres of voice had been on our minds during our writing of the various roles. There had been. And so we loaned him a record album with discs of Steber (Anne), Stignani (Baba), Bjoerling (Tom) and Domgraf-Fassbender (Shadow)." Additionally, one of the two open reel tapes contains a portion of an NBC radio broadcast of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Auden and Kallman translated the libretto for an NBC Opera Theater production of Don Giovanni in 1961, and it is likely that this is a recording of that production. Auden reads four of his poems on an Argo compilation called The Poet Speaks. Finally, one LP, Selected Poems by <extref href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf8t1nb5j6">Cornel Lengyel</extref> is inscribed "to W.H. Auden, in appreciation - Cornel Lengyel."</p>

                    <p>The collection is strong in the works of Strauss (at least sixteen records), Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Verdi, and Stravinsky. Other composers include Dvorak, Schubert, Puccini, Mozart, Wagner, Wolf, Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Schumann, Elgar, Donizetti, Berlioz, Mahler, Sibelius, Ravel, Bizet, and Chopin. Among the singers are Kirsten Flagstad, Montserrat Caballe, Beniamino Gigli, and Jussi Bjoerling, as well as several titles in the German Lebendige Vergangheit reissue series. Sir Thomas Beecham conducts on at least six recordings. Many are British pressings. It is rather strange that there are only two recordings by Benjamin Britten, considering Auden's association with him.</p>
