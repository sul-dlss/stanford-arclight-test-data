            <head>About the Programs</head>
            <p>Founded in 1989 by musician Jim Cullum and Pacific Vista Productions' Margaret Moos-Pick, <title render="bold">Riverwalk Jazz: Live At The Landing</title> quickly became public radio's foremost traditional jazz program. Focusing on the early development of jazz and related styles of American popular music, Riverwalk employed the Jim Cullum Jazz Band and a stellar lineup of regular and special guests, along with narration by David Holt (a storyteller and musician himself), to educate and entertain audiences around the country.</p>
            <p>The Jim Cullum Band established themselves long before Riverwalk with a residency at Cullum's nightclub The Landing in San Antonio, Texas. In fact, Cullum played in his father's band, known as the Happy Jazz Band, for many years, providing a direct link with the swing era (Jim Cullum Sr. had played with Jimmy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden among others). The music for the programs was recorded live before an audience, frequently at The Landing, but also from remote locations such as the Carver Center and Pearl Stable in San Antonio, the Jazz Workshop and Jazz Festival at Stanford University, and the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee. Selected recordings of these performances were incorporated into programs post-production; often multiple programs could be derived from a single concert (and likewise, a program may contain material from several performances). Some programs feature a concert in its entirety.</p>
            <p>Riverwalk features regular guests such as pianist Dick Hyman ("the most-recorded guest on the Riverwalk Jazz radio series"), actor Vernel Bagneris, singers Topsy Chapman, Nina Ferro, Rebecca Kilgore and Stephanie Nakasian, and musicians Marty Grosz, Leon Oakley, Mike Walbridge, and Duke Heitger, among many others. Some guest musicians were also occasional members of the Jim Cullum Jazz Band.</p>
            <p>The hour-long programs usually profile significant musicians, vocalists, and composers, but also delve into such subjects as life on the road, New York's nightclub scene, and gospel music's influence on jazz. While there are multiple shows on Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Bix Beiderbecke, Hoagy Carmichael, and other pioneers no longer with us, Riverwalk was also lucky to host such luminaries as Lionel Hampton, Clark Terry, Jay McShann, Doc Cheatham, Milt Hinton, Benny Carter, Spiegle Wilcox, Harry "Sweets" Edison, Bob Wilber, Ralph Sutton, Joe Williams, Bucky Pizzarelli, Kenny Davern, Yank Lawson, and Bob Haggart, as well as newer stars such as Nicholas Payton, Clint Baker, Vince Giordano, and Savion Glover.</p>
            <p>Beginning in January 2013, the Archive of Recorded Sound offers Riverwalk Jazz on its website with two concurrent streams of all Riverwalk programs at http://riverwalkjazz.stanford.edu.</p>

            <head>About The Collection</head>
            <p>While Riverwalk's streaming programs provide an opportunity to learn about and enjoy classic jazz history, the archive behind this program is equally instructive in the matter of how the radio programs were made. With over 250 boxes of material created over the course of the show's twenty-plus years, the Riverwalk Jazz archival collection includes recordings, files, photographs and ephemera reflecting every aspect of the programs' production.</p>
            <p>The finding aid has been divided into twenty-six record groups, with individual series and subseries in each group. These can be thought of in the following main categories (with considerable overlap between them): program recordings and listings ; program production recordings and files ; research recordings and files ; program proposals ; public radio and radio station files ; listener correspondence ; Jim Cullum and JCJB activity (much of it non-Riverwalk) ; Board reports ; website, catalog and newsletter files ; promotional, marketing, and fundraising recordings and files ; sponsor communication and reports ; and general administrative files (principally miscellaneous correspondence, memoranda, and notes concerning finances, conferences, staff, graphic design, etc.). There are also series for hard drives, photographs, video, posters and other oversize graphics. Other Pacific Vista productions are also present in the collection.</p>
            <p>Foremost, of course, are the radio programs. These recordings exist in multiple formats, including CD-R, DAT, open reel tape, and audiocassette, and are the source for Stanford's web streams. As many programs were edited for repeat broadcast, it was important to identify each variant. All programs are listed below, in every extant version, with guests noted. Other recordings include production elements and promotional segments, as well as material related to Riverwalk's eight-volume line of commercial recordings. While many of the recording elements are credits, voiceovers, and other material unlikely to be of much interest outside of the program's context, the historical recordings and live performances are perhaps the most compelling aspect of the entire collection.</p>
            <p>Riverwalk's broadcasts, while centering on Cullum Band performances, also drew from historical recordings and other archival material, particularly interviews. Many of these were conducted by Riverwalk's David Holt, and include musicians such as Clark Terry, Frank Foster, Stranger Malone, and Helen Jones Woods, Sherrie Tucker, and Roz Cron of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, as well as authors like Gary Giddins and Nat Hentoff. However, nearly every program features rare or unique interview material. Some are also available as transcripts.</p>
            <p>The collection also holds original multi-track live performance and rehearsal recordings of the Jim Cullum Jazz Band with guests. Also present are concerts by other groups such as Hal Smith's Roadrunners, the Hot Club of San Francisco, Uptown Lowdown Jazz Band, Yerba Buena Stompers, Independence Jazz Band, Fulton Street Jazz Band, New Black Eagle Jazz Band and Carl Sonny Leyland. Many, but not all of these recordings are featured on Riverwalk.</p>
            <p>The tremendous efforts of Pacific Vista Productions' Margaret Moos-Pick and Lynn Cruise is revealed in the extensive paper files. Among the many necessary tasks involved, they secured funding, wrote and edited scripts, coordinated recording sessions and post-production, and worked closely with broadcasters. Printed documentation of Jim Cullum's contribution to the program is limited. However, the concept of Riverwalk Jazz originated with Cullum, and it is primarily through his ideas and playing that we can appreciate the music, as well as the musicians and composers behind it.</p>

                    <p>This series contains a complete set of every Riverwalk program aired thus far, recorded for broadcast on CD-R, DAT, audiocassette, and open reel tape. Most programs exist in multiple formats. Also included here are program-specific production elements (more elements are listed elsewhere with production material). For most of the life of the show, a recording master was "uplinked" to a satellite, where it was then available to participating stations (some stations continued to receive hard copies for airplay during this time). The majority of programs are on CD-R which were removed from a master set in multiple binders. These were supplemented with other sets of recordings, and sorted under the main program title, as originally numbered by Riverwalk. Other than rebroadcasts, this listing is more or less in chronological order.</p>

                    <p>These files represent all the work behind the creation of the radio programs. Included here are tune and program rundowns, lists and inventories, scripts, interview transcripts, correspondence, notes, use permissions, photocopied sheet music and lyrics, and research material (articles, book chapters, websites, recordings, etc.). For the most part, accompanying computer disks were retained here, while music CD-Rs were removed and placed with production or program recordings. Among others items of interest, there is a great deal of Dick Hyman correspondence, as well as the transcript of an original interview with Clark Terry. Most files are organized in one series alphabetically by show title.</p>

                            <p>In 1983, following a period of financial crisis for NPR, Gwathmey was named vice president in charge of programming and played an instrumental role in rebuilding NPR's program services. Within two years NPR's programming had become more extensive and diverse than ever before, winning numerous prestigious awards for production and journalistic excellence.</p>
                            <p>Gwathmey's return to Texas was prompted by the opportunity to bring NPR programming to listeners in the last large market in the country not served by an NPR-affiliated radio station. Following his departure from NPR in Washington, D.C., Gwathmey was honored by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting with the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award, public radio's highest honor.</p>
                            <p>Upon his arrival in San Antonio in 1988 Gwathmey became the manager of classical music station KPAC-FM and helped in the final push to put NPR member station KSTX-FM on the air. He also guided a restructuring of the parent organizations licensed to operate KPAC and KSTX that resulted in the creation of the new non-profit corporation, Texas Public Radio. In 1989 he initiated plans that led to a major increase in KPAC's transmission power and to the construction of new studio and office facilities in 1992.</p>

Some of this material was also offered as supplemental material on the Riverwalk website. Many of the CD-Rs are from two binders titled "Interviews, Soundbites, etc." and from one binder titled "Interviews and Voicetracks 2006-2011."

                    <p>Various folders of proposals and ideas for programs, many of which also contain research and historical background.

                    <p>Recordings of live performances and rehearsals recorded on location, arranged chronologically by venue. With a few exceptions, the performances are by the Jim Cullum Jazz Band with guest musicians and vocalists. Venues include The Landing, Carver Center, and Pearl Stable in San Antonio, Texas; the Jazz Workshop and Jazz Festival at Stanford University ; Filoli Gardens in Woodside, California ; and the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee. Most material was used in programs, and some programs featured entire concerts. The majority are multi-track masters, some with accompanying cue sheets. Some relevant paperwork and production elements (drafts, rundowns, fixes) are also included.</p>

                    <p>Promotional and commercial releases, as well as fundraising premiums under the Riverwalk banner. These are on compact disc, CD-R, DAT, open reel tape, and cassette, and include masters and production material. Many releases are related to programs, and some may in fact be copies of radio programs. Of the Riverwalk releases, vol. 1-4 are from live radio broadcasts and contain narratives, while vol. 5-8 are from broadcast programs but contain the music only.</p>
