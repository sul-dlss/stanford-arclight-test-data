            <p>The Ozzie Hilton Collection was donated to the Stanford Archive of Recorded Sound by Heidi Hilton in 1999.</p>

            <head>Scope And Contents</head>
            <p>The Ozzie Hilton collection consists of approximately 315 audiocassettes of big band swing, jazz, and popular music of the 1930's, 40's and 50's. A few of the tapes are compilations of commercially released records, but many are taken from airchecks, transcriptions, and other sources. Perhaps most interesting from a research standpoint are several interviews with musicians. There are also live recordings from the Big Horn Jazz Festival from 1975 to 1977. While familiar names such as Duke Ellington, Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, and Count Basie are included, the artists most fully represented are Russ Morgan (with around 30 tapes devoted to his work), Henry King, and Syd Lawrence. Other bandleaders featured here are Mal Hallett, Boyd Raeburn, Alvino Rey, Tommy Tucker, and Ted Fiorito. There are also a handful of classical and polka recordings.</p>
