    <abstract id="aspace_0c45be836a2460fefa338b3b3171887b">Chartered in 1944 as the California Baptist Theological Seminary in Los Angeles.  Moved to Covina in 1951.  Federated with the Berkeley Baptist Divinity School (founded in 1871) in 1968 to become the American Baptist Seminary of the West with campuses in Covina and Berkeley. Affiliated with the American Baptist Churches in the USA and integrally related to the Graduate Theological Union. 

From Website (Dec. 8, 2009):
"ABSW traces its lineage to the 1871 Charter of California College. As one of California's earliest colleges, the school was first located in Vacaville and then moved to Oakland in 1887. In 1912 California College relocated in Berkeley, changing its name to Berkeley Baptist Divinity School. Three years later this school merged with the Pacific Coast Baptist Theological Seminary, which had begun instruction in 1890 at the First Baptist Church of Oakland and had moved to Berkeley in 1904."

"From 1915 to 1968 the school carried the name Berkeley Baptist Divinity School.  In 1968 the Berkeley Baptist Divinity School joined with California Baptist Theological Seminary, which had been founded in 1944 at Temple Baptist Church in Los Angeles and was moved to Covina in 1951. The new two-campus institution was renamed American Baptist Seminary of the West. In 1974 the Covina faculty joined the faculty in Berkeley, where together they could share in the resources of the Graduate Theological Union (GTU)."</abstract>
