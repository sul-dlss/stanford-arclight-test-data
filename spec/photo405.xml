<p>This album was given by John L. &amp; Varick D. Martin, Jr. to Stanford University's Hopkins Transportation Library, probably in the late 1930s while the brothers were attending Stanford. After the dissolution of the Hopkins Library, the album was tranferred to Special Collections.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>While there is little known documentation extant about its creation or provenance beyond the inscription "Amy White, from her brother Howard. Christmas 1871," evidence suggests this scrapbook was compiled to commemorate a trip (probably by Amy and possibly with her brother) through the western United States on the Central Pacific Railroad, traveling through Utah, Nevada, the Sierras and Yosemite, San Francisco and the peninsula, Napa, Mendocino, and southern Oregon. The bulk of the photos are from California.</p><p>The album (which has been unbound) consists of 257 albumen photographs glued to 72 leaves, with captions written in ink. A few pages have other items, including a music program and advertisement, yellow lichen from Yosemite, and a program for a ship launch. Although uncredited, all photos appear to be from Western photographers whose work was commercially available in the form of stereoviews, cabinet cards, and as prints such as the ones here. Various firms, including Lawrence &amp; Houseworth, offered catalogs of images that customers could select from in order to create a custom scrapbook, to which the personal mementos were added. Also, it is possible that Howard made the album himself. The trip's itinerary as noted in the captions is dated from April to July, 1871, but other captions imply 1872, after the date in the inscription. However, the photos themselves were taken from approximately 1864 to 1870.</p><p>The photographer most represented in the album is Carleton Watkins, but there are also many photos by Alfred Hart, as well several also published by Lawrence &amp; Houseworth (who never credited original photographers, whether they worked for them or not). Others have been determined to be by Eadweard Muybridge, Charles Savage, Andrew J. Russell, and Timothy O'Sullivan. A few of the images were not identified, and could be rejected or unpublished work by the above. Cropping and developing vary from published versions as well. </p><p>The majority of views highlight the West's natural wonders and the railroad; there are also depictions of ships, docks, waterways, mining, San Francisco banks, churches, and hotels, and the Barron, Ralston and Atherton estates on the peninsula. Of the few human figures in the photographs, there are two portraits of Yosemite naturalist Galen Clark, and a possibly unique print by Watkins capturing Clarence King, Frederick Clark and Gilbert Munger at Mt. Shasta Camp in 1870.</p><p>More information which has been gathered about the album (including a list matching the prints to published works) will be offered at some poimt in the future. An unpublished spreadsheet is available.</p>  </scopecontent>
