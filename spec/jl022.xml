            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection, which was given by his son, consists of some correspondence and documents relating to his early civil service jobs, his oil associations and his position with the Insurance Broker's Exchange. However, the great majority of the collection is lists and copies of articles that Dahl had published in various magazines and other periodicals between 1910 and 1937. Writing was a profitable hobby, at which he spent his spare hours from his business career. The articles range from highly technical articles about agricultural machines and methods to anecdotes with morals. In some cases the entire periodical, in which an article by Dahl is reproduced, has been preserved, and they provide interesting and rare reading material. A Good example of this is the issues of 
                <emph render="underline">Grit</emph> dated from 1916 to 1925.</p>
