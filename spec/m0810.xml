This pageant was envisioned as an alternative to the Miss America pageant. Contestants in both pageants were young, unmarried women who represented their land of orign. Miss America contestants represented their home states and Miss Indian America contestants represented their tribe. The pageants were very similar and contestants in both demonstrated their talents onstage. Miss Indian America contestants did not wear swimsuits but instead wore traditional tribal dresses. The winner of the Miss Indian America pageant embarked on a speaking tour in order to gain awareness for a charity of her choice and also met with the winner of the Miss America pageant. The Miss Indian America pageant was one of the main events of the American Indian Days which celebrated tribal traditions and events over the course of three days.

<p>In the 1950s Sheridan, Wyoming resembled Jim Crow-era South with tensions between the Native American population and the white residents. In 1952, a young Crow Indian girl named Lucy Yellow Mule was selected as the Sheridan-WYO- Rodeo Queen leading to a movement to improve the relationships among the community members of Sheridan. Sheridan also won two awards the "Silver Anvil" National Honor Award and the George Washington Honor Medal Freedom Foundaton of Valley Forge Pennsylvania for promoting better understanding and tolerance between races. From these two awards, All American Indian Days was established. The event was intended to preserve Indian rituals, tribal games, clothing, art, language and stories. </p><p>The Miss Indian America Pageant began in 1954 as part of the All American Indian Days and was held each year in Sheridan, Wyoming. In 1984, the pageant moved to Bismarck, North Dakota where it was held until the mid- 1990s. The pageant was intended to select someone who would be a good public relations representative for the Native American community. Miss Indian America must be someone "dedicated to the cultural well-being of tribe, she must have a comprehensive knowledge of her people and be dedicated to their advancement. She must have the appearance, personality and poise to represent her people in the white community." The winner of the pageant spent a year traveling around the United States speaking about her tribe and Native American issues. </p><p>The contestants were unmarried women between the ages of 16 and 25. They were asked to wear traditional costumes including headdresses and feathers even if these accessories were not part of contestant's tribal outfit and present a talent. Each contestant also gave a personal gift to her sponsor. Most of the judges were white throughout the pageant's history.  </p><p>Seavey, C. (2012, October 29). All- American Days are Gone.
