Gordon's Taped answers are crystal clear sound bites. Gordon gives totally uncensored views on black actors, his directing style, Leadbelly's personal meaning for him, Paramount's distribution tactics, his photography's influence, his camera style, hollywood prejudice, his mandate for a black crew, his film's benefits for blacks. Gordon Parks selves into where he grew up, how he worked with black people who had never worked in front of cameras, views of how much a director directs.  His next projects including a Concerto for Cello and Orchestra. The symbolic meaning of Leadbelly's life to him as an artist, his catching a Leadbelly performance in 1949 - 2 months before Leadbelly's death. Why he didn't use Leadbelly's own recordings in the film as an insight into Leadbelly's treatment by his times and the smash hit of his song Goodnight Irene 8 months following his death and Leadbelly's view of his legacy and Park's. His problems with Paramount's distribution of his film and his views without a black VIP insider the film never would have been made. Why he won't make fast buck films. The influence of his photography, particularly fashion photography for Vogue, on how he shoots films. Views on what he searches for in shots -- beauty vs. truth. His relationship to cameraman, how much he frames shot, shots he took in film. How Ken Hyman. Pres. of Warner Brothers 7 Arts, broke down Hollywood prejudices to get him his first film project, Learning Tree, which he wrote, scored and produced from his book. His mandate for a black film crew and its fulfillment on Learning Tree, on Leadbelly, sources for Leadbelly's Life. An interview with a black reporter: Will people see Leadbelly rather than black stud films? What he hopes to accomplish for recognition of Leadbelly's achievements. Will he make more historical biographical films, Benefit of Leadbelly for our people.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
