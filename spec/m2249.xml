    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The collection contains selected transcripts from Atari Corporation vs. Nintendo of America, Inc.(N.D. Cal. filed Jan. 30, 1989) (No. C-89-0824-FMS), one of several important suits between the two video game manufacturers. These transcripts belonged to Richard Lehrberg (1947-2015), an expert witness in the suit. Lehrberg had been a game buyer for Sears in the early 1980s who then worked at Activision before forming his own company, Lehrberg Associates, an international software licensing company in 1989.</p><p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was explosively popular. Nintendo wielded a great deal of authority as a result, and used this to micromanage third-party developers. Among other stipulations, any licensee could not release the game for any other system for two years, and had to use Nintendo’s own cartridges rather than obtaining their own. Nintendo enforced this process by making the NES only work with Nintendo-manufactured cartridges, which had a proprietary 10NES chip that served as the “key.” </p><p>Atari Games found a way around this obstacle, as they obtained a copy of the 10NES patent application under false pretenses and copied the chip. Atari’s imprint Tengen Games was created for the purpose of using non-Nintendo cartridges, and non-Nintendo-approved games began to appear on the market. 
	
As this was taking place, an international chip shortage was creating bottlenecks for licensees reliant on the Nintendo cartridge. Atari sued Nintendo, citing antitrust violations and claiming that Nintendo intentionally orchestrated the chip shortage. Nintendo countersued; Atari had actually become a licensee of Nintendo the previous year. 
	
Atari’s argument hinged in part on the claim that the 10NES patent wasn’t meaningful as Atari had already reverse-engineered the code. This claim was clearly shown to be false when Atari’s “rabbit chip” was revealed to have imitated a slightly outdated version of the 10NES chip. This older version included inefficient code later improved by Nintendo, which then showed up in Atari’s code as well. The court initially ruled in Nintendo’s favor. Atari was ordered to immediately stop making and selling their self-produced cartridges, and shut down Tengen. Atari appealed on the basis of the layoffs this would entail, and the verdict was withheld.</p><p>Several months later, in the US Court of Appeals, Atari defended reverse engineering as fair use, and claimed Nintendo was committing copyright abuse. The claim about copyright abuse was dismissed, but the court agreed regarding the fair use assertion. The court upheld the original ruling, however, in the context of Atari stealing the 10NES code, dealing a massive blow to Atari.</p><p> This case resulted in governmental concern with Nintendo and antitrust regulations, which would lead Nintendo to give up certain stipulations such as console exclusivity. This then allowed developers to release games for multiple systems at the same time- which, in the nineties, often ended up being the SNES and the Sega Genesis. Even though Atari lost, the case did result in alternatives to Nintendo becoming more viable.</p>  </bioghist>
