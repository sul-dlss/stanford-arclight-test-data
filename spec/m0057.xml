      <head>BIOGRAPHY</head>
      <p>Paul Shoup, son of Timothy and Sarah Sumner Shoup, was born in San Bernardino, California on January 8, 1874. While still in school, he worked delivering newspapers and later as a local correspondent for a Los Angeles paper. He was graduated from San Bernardino High School in 1891 and afterwards obtained a clerical job in the mechanical department of the Atchinson, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at San Bernardino.</p>
      <p>In 1892, young Paul began his forty-seven year career with the Southern Pacific Company as a ticket clerk in the San Bernardino office. Shoup quickly learned other aspects of the business and worked in the telegraph and freight offices before going into the general office traffic service. Miss Rose Wilson became Mrs. Paul Shoup on December 1, 1900. The Shoups had three children: Carl Sumner, Jack Wilson, and Louise.</p>
      <p>In the year following his marriage, Shoup became district freight and passenger agent at San Jose, his first official position. He rose rapidly in the traffic department becoming assistant general freight and passenger agent and an executive of the line at Portland, Oregon. When the earthquake and fire struck San Francisco in 1906, Shoup returned from Portland to serve on the board directing rehabilitation work.</p>
      <p>In 1910 Shoup was appointed assistant general manager in charge of the railroad's municipal and inter-urban electric lines in several California cities. Two years later he was made president of the Pacific Electric Railway Company. With the outbreak of World War I, the government took over the operation of the nation's railroads and Shoup was made vice president in charge of the property interests of Southern Pacific and its affiliated and proprietary concerns.</p>
      <p>The Southern Pacific Company named Paul Shoup vice president and assistant to the president in 1920, and in 1925, he was appointed executive vice president. In 1929 he became president and in 1932, vice chairman of the board with offices in New York. He retired from the vice chairmanship and Southern Pacific in 1938 to serve as president of Southern Californians, Inc., an employer group organized to "fight racketeering in labor relations."</p>
      <p>Shoup had many interests besides the railroad industry. One of his earliest ambitions had been to become a professional writer, and in his early career had had a number of stories published. He published numerous articles and made speeches on a variety of subjects connected with his business and political interests. According to various newspaper accounts of his career, Shoup is supposed to have been one of the initial founders of "Sunset Magazine"--originally a railroadmen's trade journal--and to have been instrumental in building it to become one of the West's leading popular magazines.</p>
      <p>Paul Shoup was also president of the Pacific Oil Company and Associated 0il Company and served on the boards of several other oil, land, gas, electric, and railroad companies, including Tide Water Oil. He wrote and conferred a great deal with Congressional and governmental agencies on labor and management problems, ways to reduce the effects of the Depression, and spoke out against the Social Security Act and parts of the Interstate Commerce Act. A Republican in politics, he was very active in the campaign of Alfred M. Landon for President in 1935-36.</p>
      <p>Shoup belonged to a number of clubs, including the Bohemian, the Bankers (New York), the Pacific Union (San Francisco), and the Jonathan. He was President of the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, Inc. and was a member of the board of trustees of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Inc. and Stanford University, where both his sons received their undergraduate degrees. After a long, active and varied career, Paul Shoup died in California on July 30, 1946.</p>
      <p>Most of this biographical material is drawn from 
<bibref linktype="simple"><title linktype="simple">Who's Who in America, vol. 23, 1944-1945; </title></bibref>and various newspaper clippings found in the collection.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent id="scopecontent-1.8.4">
      <head>SCOPE AND CONTENT</head>
      <p>The Paul Shoup collection contains some 7,500 items, by rough estimate, and covers primarily his terms as president and vice chairman of the Southern Pacific Company between 1929 and 1938. There are some items dated 1928 and some pertaining to Southern Californians, Inc., which he joined after retiring from Southern Pacific in 1938. There are also a few items dated as late as 1945 and 1946. The collection is made up, in part, of personal and business correspondence, various business papers and reports, minutes of meetings of stockholders and boards of directors, financial statements, annual reports, governmental and Congressional documents, Depression relief proposals, clippings, memos, and Shoup's own articles and addresses.</p>
      <p>The subject matter covered is rich and varied. In the area of business there are the railroad and oil companies of which the outstanding are Southern Pacific and Tide Water Oil Company. There are also the directors' and stockholders' meetings and the J. Paul Getty proxie fight. Agreements with persons such as R. Stanley Dollar and organizations such as the Calmexico Syndicate and the Mission Corporation also appear.</p>
      <p>In politics, Shoup was a Republican. He was a personal friend of Herbert Hoover and corresponded with him on numerous subjects. There are some Hoover autograph letters in the collection including one on a White House letterhead. Shoup was also active in Alf Landon's 1935-36 campaign for the Presidency against Roosevelt and there is a folder of material as well as a number of clippings relating to that subject.</p>
      <p>Other subjects can be described as having both political and business facets. Correspondence about the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and with Jesse Jones, articles against portions of the Interstate Commerce Act and the Social Security Act, and Shoup's own indictment along with several oil companies by the federal government for violation of anti-trust legislation, can be placed in this category. The correspondence also points up how much effort in terms of time and money was spent by bankers and railroad executives to find some plan for stemming the Depression and increasing employment.</p>
      <p>There is also a fair amount of correspondence relating to StanfordUniversity. As the father of two alumni and a member of the Board of Trustees, Shoup had an active interest in the school. He helped to finance the Hoover Library and the Children's Convalescent Home. During the Depression, he was concerned about the problem of bolstering finances of the University.</p>
