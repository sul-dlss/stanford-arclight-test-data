In the early 1970s, she began utilizing the tools of Conceptual art—especially serial photography and performance documentation—to insert social commentary, biographical representation, and fantasy into a discourse that had until then been much more focused upon the systematic and the semiotic.  <title render="italic">Carving a Traditional Sculpture</title> (1972), for example, consisted of 144 gridded photographs of a nude Antin, arranged chronologically to document her weight loss over thirty-six days.  History—and women's place in it—has been an important theme.  Eleanor Antinova, her most well known and long-lived performative persona, was a fictional, marginalized member of the celebrated Ballets Russes and a demonstration of continuing gender and racial inequalities.  <title render="italic">100 Boots</title> (1971-73), a classic work of Conceptual art, featured 51 images of boots in scenes that progressed from one American coast to the other.</p><p>Antin's later work has tended to incorporate quasi-historical themes; her recent photographic series include <title render="italic">Roman Allegories</title> (2004) and <title render="italic">The Last Days of Pompeii</title> (2001).</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref155_oqf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Antin_2006-07-22.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Eleanor Antin, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22"><daodesc><p>Eleanor Antin, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22: 2006-07-22</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_f2e69bf25ac8de01d82977f3170a19e3" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_73f70584be7810999b1e7a92bef5db73" parent="aspace_f2e69bf25ac8de01d82977f3170a19e3" type="videotape">1A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_4326a7cbdec2f6a68884a2ae932dffb7"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (1A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref152_s8d" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Janine Antoni</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_5ec266cafb474342d1acd4b9747d4915"><head>Biography</head><p>Janine Antoni (b. 1964) is a performance artist, sculptor, and photographer who often explores the transitions between making and finished product—a focus that results in sculptural installations that appear both static and revelatory of the artist's creative process.  <title render="italic">Gnaw</title> (1992) and <title render="italic">Lick and Lather</title> (1993) are two of her most well known works.  In both, Antoni used materials in which she could leave lasting human marks: in <title render="italic">Gnaw</title>, she presented two Minimalist cubes—one of chocolate, the other of lard—that she had chewed away into deliberate deformity.  In <title render="italic">Lick and Lather</title>, she ingested chocolate self-portrait busts and washed away soap ones into varying degrees of obscurity.  These and other works—messy, unsterile—have caused viewers to re-envision the bodiliness of both abstract and figural forms; to acknowledge that feminine discretion (especially to keep body fluids hidden and their sources undisclosed) has long been a cultural expectation.  <title render="italic">Loving Care</title> (1993) took these notions to an extreme, the piece consisting of the visual and physical remnants of Antoni's sweeping of her dye-filled hair, like a paint brush but much more personal, across a gallery floor.</p><p>In approaching her work in this way, Antoni has adopted a project that has motivated many activist, feminist artists both of her generation and earlier: to acknowledge the feminine body and to celebrate it.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref153_4nc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Brooklyn, NY; 2006-05-10</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Antoni_2006-05-10_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Janine Antoni, Brooklyn, NY; 2006-05-10"><daodesc><p>Janine Antoni, Brooklyn, NY; 2006-05-10: 2006-05-10</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Antoni_2006-05-10_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Janine Antoni, Brooklyn, NY; 2006-05-10"><daodesc><p>Janine Antoni, Brooklyn, NY; 2006-05-10: 2006-05-10</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_f6a5db2d995470b015d5e20e40b64634" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_efd847a0f5b5f479dcfa176eb403b69f" parent="aspace_f6a5db2d995470b015d5e20e40b64634" type="videotape">2A-2B</container></did><phystech id="aspace_758f6fe49701df10deb1ce71d685c421"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (2A-2B), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref30_c3n" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Judith Baca</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_6752a2a58e6b6c673cf3eb3453f6fb1b"><head>Biography</head><p>Judith (Judy) Baca (b. 1946), a Mexican-American artist and activist working primarily in Los Angeles,  has dedicated her career to demonstrating the ways in which public art, created in partnership with community members, can be a force for social change.  One of her first undertakings after college was a collaborative mural project aimed at tempering gang violence (1969).  In 1976 she co-founded the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC), which has been a source of inspiration, support, and sponsorship for projects that address the identities and concerns of underrepresented populations such as women, immigrants, and the economically disadvantaged.  Because these murals and related public art installations are located in the neighborhoods in which the participants live, a strong sense of joint ownership accompanies the works' creation.</p><p>Baca's most celebrated work is <title render="italic">The Great Wall of Los Angeles</title>, a mural project begun in 1973 in the Tujunga Flood Control Channel of the San Fernando Valley.  Completed over the course of five years, <title render="italic">The Great Wall</title> acts as a visual narrative of centuries of California history—especially of that history which has consistently been underrepresented in "official" documents and textbooks.  It, and Baca's mural projects in general, find their stylistic precedents in the works of the Mexican muralists and the W.P.A., yet the social activism and specific themes that they espouse are decidedly contemporary.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref42_iv5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Catalina Island, CA; 1992-10-02</unittitle><container id="aspace_8e3a0b9acd03780fb3d0231c77d1a7e7" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_be92083ab2601d0a627f2671b1531759" parent="aspace_8e3a0b9acd03780fb3d0231c77d1a7e7" type="videotape">3A, 3A-copy</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Baca_1992-10-02.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judith Baca, Catalina Island, CA; 1992-10-02"><daodesc><p>Judith Baca, Catalina Island, CA; 1992-10-02: 1992-10-02</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_07860ca9b878ad1917fe21ad2c434d98"><head>Format</head><p>Hi-8 (3A), U-matic (3A-copy), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref128_3mk" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Judith Baca and Suzanne Lacy</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref129_bl3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles, CA; 2004-07-07</unittitle><container id="aspace_60a06c6c415b58f9ba54030f0226706c" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_27388dd3b7ff95ac30d3a1e4e67809a7" parent="aspace_60a06c6c415b58f9ba54030f0226706c" type="videotape">3B, 6A</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Baca_Lacy_2004-07-07_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judith Baca and Suzanne Lacy, Los Angeles, CA; 2004-07-07"><daodesc><p>Judith Baca and Suzanne Lacy, Los Angeles, CA; 2004-07-07: 2004-07-07</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_38832aaf9d1cd3276e0c8824002b1f12"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (3B, 6A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref181_x7b" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Judith Brodsky</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_2042185706b7ec29f4d765d0622acf0b"><head>Biography</head><p>Judith K.

Her final exhibition for MOCA, <title render="italic">WACK!</title> served as a retrospective exploration of the effects that feminist art of the 1970s had on the art and society that surrounded it.

Having begun her career as a painter and sculptor in the late modernist vein, she radically varied the course of her career in the early 1970s by adopting an overtly feminist, and often sexual, iconography for her own work.  In partnership with Miriam Schapiro she established the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts, which opened in 1972.  It was meant to serve as a place for young female artists to discover a new way of making art, removed from the entrenched male-centrism that she asserted occupied most art schools.  A notable result of this program's establishment was the organization of Womanhouse, a collaborative space occupied by female artists working in various media.  The Feminist Studio Workshop, which she founded with Sheila de Bretteville and Arlene Raven and which was not affiliated with CalArts, opened in 1973.</p><p>In parallel with her artistic and pedagogical endeavors, Chicago published <title render="italic">Through the Flower</title>, a work that has become a touchstone for feminist autobiographical writing of the 1970s.  <title render="italic">Beyond the Flower</title> is a sequel of sorts, describing her post-1970s life and the evolution of both her career and her views on the place of women in society.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref45_s5p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09</unittitle><container id="aspace_0c3c92e8e349b527d4c4ea1e52ba958a" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_328261a04d48343557c11783cbb3fcf0" parent="aspace_0c3c92e8e349b527d4c4ea1e52ba958a" type="videotape">5A-5C</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Chicago_1990-11-09_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09"><daodesc><p>Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09: 1990-11-09</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Chicago_1990-11-09_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09"><daodesc><p>Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09: 1990-11-09</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Chicago_1990-11-09_p3.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09"><daodesc><p>Judy Chicago, Hayward, CA; 1990-11-09: 1990-11-09</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_e89c76e8336a3f53521b3de35034fdc3"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (5A, 5B, 5C), Digital .mov files (3)</p></phystech></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref147_1j1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Davis, CA; 2005-03-04</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Chicago_2005-03-04.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Judy Chicago, Davis, CA; 2005-03-04"><daodesc><p>Judy Chicago, Davis, CA; 2005-03-04: 2005-03-04</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_09a3cd9bb3ba8bc076046dff7bd1f7a9" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_f7cf18cbaabff44f8c3a1116aea8bedc" parent="aspace_09a3cd9bb3ba8bc076046dff7bd1f7a9" type="videotape">5H</container></did><phystech id="aspace_ed51148b9375adc88d7e1212edee59cd"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (5H), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref162_dnp" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Beatriz da Costa</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref163_stv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles, CA; 2004-07-07</unittitle><container id="aspace_6d367c53b1012654ecc133af5f76bede" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_8cba7bf0add7026837b828db82bce656" parent="aspace_6d367c53b1012654ecc133af5f76bede" type="videotape">6A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_da3fcb147204dad315a2ff19103ac6f8"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (6A)</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref210_xao" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>DISBAND performance</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref211_gmd" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2008-02-28</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_PS1_2008-02-28.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="DISBAND performance, New York, NY; 2008-02-28"><daodesc><p>DISBAND performance, New York, NY; 2008-02-28: 2008-02-28</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_a941c4966181fafc9335e2df405b241a"><head>Format</head><p>Digital .mov file</p></phystech><originalsloc id="aspace_d72398285d70853ed25db0f450302079"><head>Existence and Location of Originals note</head><p>The DISBAND performance begins at 00:06:36 and ends at 00:18:18 on the PS 1 digital file.</p></originalsloc></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref158_zpo" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Mary Beth Edelson</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_28bab75fa5baaf3e917d81eba11ecf5b"><head>Biography</head><p>Mary Beth Edelson (b. 1933) creates works that impel viewers to confront the feminine body and the ways in which it has been both exploited and underrepresented in the history of art.  One of her primary strategies has been to portray women as primordial archetypes—created before the establishment of patriarchal societies—such as goddesses, tricksters, and warriors.  She demonstrated this most famously in her series of black-and-white self portraits in which she drew and painted on nude photographs of herself posed atop boulders, in the woods, or in the undefined zone of a gallery space.  By presenting herself so self-possessed and unapologetically unclothed, she hoped to help loosen the centuries-old grip that male artists held on the passive female body.</p><p>Another one of her tactics has been to re-present famous artworks collaged with the faces and bodies of women.  In <title render="italic">Some Living American Woman Artists/Last Supper</title> (1972), for example, Edelson covered the faces of Da Vinci's <title render="italic">Last Supper</title> attendees with images of contemporary female artists, Jesus being represented here by Georgia O'Keeffe.  As with many of her works, Edelson combined humor and gravity, aiming to create an atmosphere that was subversively assertive.</p><p>Edelson has also worked in collaborative and/or political environments, participating in the early exhibitions at A.I.R. Gallery (founded in 1972), taking part in the Heresies Collective, and helping to lead the Women's Action Coalition from 1992-94.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref159_bf6" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2007-02-07</unittitle><container id="aspace_6c20c4644002fb915e2a31102c245251" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_0157164c1d877a93519b550364a5db24" parent="aspace_6c20c4644002fb915e2a31102c245251" type="videotape">8A-8B</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Edelson_2007-07-02_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Mary Beth Edelson, New York, NY; 2007-07-02"><daodesc><p>Mary Beth Edelson, New York, NY; 2007-07-02: 2007-02-07</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Edelson_2007-02-07_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Mary Beth Edelson, New York, NY; 2007-07-02"><daodesc><p>Mary Beth Edelson, New York, NY; 2007-07-02: 2007-02-07</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_a536b2ee4891393a6590afb5c7054b75"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (8A, 8B), Digital .mov files (2)</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref164_4w9" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Howard Fox</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_77b2933f5cfb864a2b86ba796d4b662f"><head>Biography</head><p>Howard Fox is former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Members maintain their anonymity—important for keeping their messages broad and their professional identities safe—by the trademark donning of gorilla masks and by the adoption of female artist pseudonyms.</p><p>The distribution of posters across SoHo and the East Village was the Guerrilla Girls' first strategic action, soon followed by protests, speaking engagements, and surprise appearances.  One poster (1988), for example, declared that "the advantages of being a woman artist" included "working without the pressure of success" and "not having to undergo the embarrassment of being called a genius."  Another (1990) presented a pop quiz: "Q: If February is Black History Month and March is Women's History Month, what happens the rest of the year? A: Discrimination."  Combining simple graphics, clear yet clever statements, and illustrative statistics, the posters were created in order to target the art system at its epicenter, New York City.  The Guerrilla Girls have more recently expanded their focus to California, Spain, Mexico, China, and elsewhere.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref157_xxw" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2006-05-13</unittitle><container id="aspace_488f13fac9d34f70746a401cc7ca0c32" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_1af0a66d6eb27e4f979de33b10be0dee" parent="aspace_488f13fac9d34f70746a401cc7ca0c32" type="videotapes">11B-copy, 11C-11E</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerilla_Girls_Group_2006-05-13_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13"><daodesc><p>Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13: 2006-05-13</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerilla_Girls_Group_2006-05-13_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13"><daodesc><p>Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13: 2006-05-13</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerilla_Girls_Whitney_2006-05-13_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13"><daodesc><p>Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13: 2006-05-13</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerilla_Girls_Group_2006-05-13_p3.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13"><daodesc><p>Guerilla Girls, New York, NY; 2006-05-13: 2006-05-13</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_f45d4f20fb5dadf708730ec670c94d62"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (11B-copy), Mini-DV (11C, 11D, 11E), Digital .mov files (4)</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref171_vm8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Guerrilla Girls-Kathe Kollwitz</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref173_wbv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22</unittitle><container id="aspace_57b5e3840d758860ca998cc5bcd8aaa0" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_28c1e9c7c0fa128b972efcd7fe7320d8" parent="aspace_57b5e3840d758860ca998cc5bcd8aaa0" type="videotape">11A-copy</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerilla_Girls_Kathe_Kollwitz_2006-07-22.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerilla Girls-Kathe Kollwitz, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22"><daodesc><p>Guerilla Girls-Kathe Kollwitz, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-22: 2006-07-22</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_f3b2f9e783674204eccda7b494ac4039"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (11A-copy), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref309_l20" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Guerrilla Girls-Violette Leduc</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref201_tt2" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2008-02-15</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerrilla_Girl_single_2008-02-15.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Guerrilla Girls-Violette Leduc, New York, NY; 2008-02-15"><daodesc><p>Guerrilla Girls-Violette Leduc, New York, NY; 2008-02-15</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_b9227ba734a90993c32bf91bd6905f68"><head>Format</head><p>Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref183_6j5" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Harmony Hammond</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_31782cef13f99c7afee978e5ffd60b6f"><head>Biography</head><p>Harmony Hammond (b. 1944) has, throughout her career, actively combined her work as an artist with her goals as an activist.  The artwork she has produced is grounded in the assertion that traditionally feminine qualities—emotionality, bodiliness, domesticity—are worthy subjects, and also means, for art making.  The sculptural pieces she created in the early 1970s featured swaths of fabric as a primary material; her series of rag rugs from the same years evoked the products of traditional women's handwork.  Her paintings, while almost exclusively abstract, are strongly textured and colored and reveal the processes of their making.  Hammond asserts that this creative process, a specific experience for the female artist, is an important component of the finished object's meaning.</p><p>Much of Hammond's work as an activist has taken place in museums and galleries.  She was a founding member of A.I.R. Gallery, a female artist-run organization focused exclusively upon work by women.  In 1978 she curated "A Lesbian Show" at 122 Green Street Workshop, through which she featured work by lesbian artists.

Between the years of 1974 and 1978, Hershman Leeson spent much of her time performing as an alter ego, the character Roberta Breitmore.  Much of the work—drawings, photographs, clothing, medical records, letters, etc.—Hershman Leeson produced during the Breitmore years related to the character's emotional and practical existences.  Hershman Leeson seemed to be demonstrating that the two existences could and should not be easily separated—nor should the artist herself be easily separated from the character she created.</p><p>Hershman Leeson's work in film, video, and new media has been equally focused toward exploring the ways that bodies interact and define themselves.  <title render="italic">Lorna</title> (1983-84), described by the artist as "the first interactive video art disc," allowed the viewer to experience the emotions of the title character while also, at key points, making important decisions for her.  The viewer was both entwined with and removed from Lorna's life.</p><p>In the 1980s and 90s, Hershman continued to focus on new media, expanding her work in video and creating online environments that incorporated artificial intelligence.  Concurrently, she began to direct feature films; her first film, <title render="italic">Conceiving Ada</title> (1997), situated the nineteenth-century computer science innovator Ada Lovelace in juxtaposition with the twentieth-century computer reality that she helped to create.</p><p>A winner of numerous awards and honors for her contributions to art practice, Hershman Leeson is currently Chair of the Film Department at the San Francisco Art Institute.  She is Professor Emerita at the University of California, Davis, and an A.D. White Professor at large at Cornell University.  <title render="italic">!Women Art Revolution</title> reflects years of interviews that Hershman Leeson has compiled in order to tell the story of the feminist art movement in the artists' own words.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref194_8gt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Davis, CA; 2005-03-04</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Hershman_2005-03-04.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Davis, CA; 2005-03-04"><daodesc><p>Davis, CA; 2005-03-04</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_5b9c64e779a79cc3015121b62d75b3a3" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_3096a4a59845a662baa089c972f0aa37" parent="aspace_5b9c64e779a79cc3015121b62d75b3a3" type="videotape">12A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_830ecc5ce8018006b37cdc76c9b01ebc"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (12A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref215_pcw" level="file"><did><unittitle>San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rich_2006-10-24_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Lynn Hershman, San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24"><daodesc><p>Lynn Hershman, San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24: 2006-10-24</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_1bb6d85b8d5bb8c08373fffa74ccc678"><head>Format</head><p>Digital .mov file</p></phystech><originalsloc id="aspace_a10afa5113e95b30d6dfe859b38cf6ab"><head>Existence and Location of Originals note</head><p>The 2006 Lynn Hershman interview begins at 00:06:33 in the B.

July's writing, which includes short stories and personal essays, continues this inclusive strategy.  Most notable are <title render="italic">No One Belongs Here More Than You</title> (2007) and <title render="italic">Learning to Love You More</title> (2007), the titles themselves implying the participation and importance of an unknown individual(s), their accompanying Web sites inviting interaction of a different sort.</p><p>July's relationship to the feminist artists of the previous generation is indirect yet distinct.  The issues of politics and power that infuse many of her works are informed by the spirit of radical protest that surrounded her in Berkeley, where she spent her youth and began her career as an artist.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref180_ygr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-27</unittitle><container id="aspace_2bae96e8343d908f3bb929a423407b6f" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_7fc65174282bfcf6d6ea35865a7c4990" parent="aspace_2bae96e8343d908f3bb929a423407b6f" type="videotape">11A-copy</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Guerrilla_Girls_Kathe_Kollwitz_2006_07_22.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Miranda July, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-27"><daodesc><p>Miranda July, Santa Monica, CA; 2006-07-27</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_8e4bab94a53ec9af649bbe8c7a6a4f95"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (11A-copy), Digital .mov file</p></phystech><originalsloc id="aspace_e1fca20abaa7ece61fe868a8069fbef3"><head>Existence and Location of Originals note</head><p>This interview is on the same videotape and in the same digital video file as the Guerrilla Girl "Kathe Kollwitz" interview.

As a graduate student at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) between the years of 1976 and 1978, he was exposed to the feminist aesthetic and attitude that had flourished there in the early 1970s under the leadership of Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro.  Though Kelley does not consider his work to be directly influenced by the styles and strategies of feminist art, he does cite its performative and cooperative aspects, its adoption of traditionally feminine craft materials, and its attention to social, sexual, and psychological issues as important for his own growth as an artist.</p><p>Sculptural installations that incorporate used stuffed animals in odd, conjoined arrangements are perhaps Kelley's most well known works.  These animal sculptures have often struck viewers as unsettling and somehow both personal and repellent, reactions that the artist has spent much time exploring and, at times, consciously exploiting.  Other works, such as the video/installation <title render="italic">Day is Done</title> (2005), present a panoply of popular culture visual markers; in <title render="italic">Day is Done</title> these relate to the extracurricular activities associated with high school.</p><p>Kelley's mode is often cross-disciplinary.  As a young man in Detroit he played in the rock band Destroy All Monsters; musical collaborations and the punk sub-culture continue to inform his aesthetic.  His writing, a substantial component of his oeuvre, ranges from art criticism to psychological musings to performative texts.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref150_wyy" level="file"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles, CA; 2006-07-27</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Kelley_2006-07-27_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Mike Kelley, Los Angeles, CA; 2006-07-27"><daodesc><p>Mike Kelley, Los Angeles, CA; 2006-07-27: 2006-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Kelley_2006-07-27_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Mike Kelley, Los Angeles, CA; 2006-07-27"><daodesc><p>Mike Kelley, Los Angeles, CA; 2006-07-27: 2006-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_7ea70df13f990e98a149f0f54e83be20" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_a7a2692579c46fc634020c889e118bd2" parent="aspace_7ea70df13f990e98a149f0f54e83be20" type="videotape">15A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_c91f16d1e7c796de3365e85b5626a723"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (15A), Digital .mov files (2)</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref139_fje" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Joyce Kozloff</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_9ddd93000b82d859ea02d16514e42172"><head>Biography</head><p>Born in 1942, Joyce Kozloff was a co-founder of the Pattern and Decoration movement of  the 1970s.

Kushner is also one of the few men who had a key role in the Pattern and Decoration Movement.  Originating in New York in the mid-1970s, the movement was one aspect of the reaction against the stark impersonality of Minimal art and also represented a defense of the idea that decorative art is a humanizing influence that should not be regarded as inferior to "fine" art.  Many of the artists involved in the movement were women who were interested in exploring how the decorative crafts that have traditionally carried feminine associations could bear renewed, progressive meanings.  Notable artists in this group include Joyce Kozloff and Miriam Schapiro.  Kushner continues to work in this mode; on the occasion of his twenty-five year retrospective at the New Jersey Center for Visual Arts he noted, "I really believe the public deserves something beautiful."</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref169_x63" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2006-05-12</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Kushner_2006-05-12.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Robert Kushner, New York, NY; 2006-05-12"><daodesc><p>Robert Kushner, New York, NY; 2006-05-12: 2006-05-12</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_ad28728cefa21c903159a692f1772e53" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_12d2514ed8dd2190cb570cdca1c1480c" parent="aspace_ad28728cefa21c903159a692f1772e53" type="videotape">17A-copy</container></did><phystech id="aspace_6c7be105ab6340f099848ded76812ade"><head>Format</head><p>DVCAM (17A-copy), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref33_zhr" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Suzanne Lacy</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_bfbc14c0f4286143b08098c69dfcee2d"><head>Biography</head><p>Suzanne Lacy (b. 1945) is an activist and performance artist whose work includes installations, videos and large-scale performances on social themes and urban issues.

After studying at the Martha Graham School and with Merce Cunningham, she began to choreograph works through which she could challenge traditional notions of dance performance.  Most notably in <title render="italic">Trio A</title> (first performed in 1968 as part of the larger work <title render="italic">The Mind is a Muscle</title>), Rainer utilized a flow of mundane movements to complicate the performer/audience relationship and to draw attention to the body as a functional object—a strategy that finds its parallels in Minimalism.  Her work in the 1970s, increasingly film-based, became more oriented toward content and context while still maintaining a focus upon form.  Her <title render="italic">Film About A Woman Who...</title> (1974) drew attention to the place of women in a male-dominated society.  Later films, such as <title render="italic">Privilege</title> (1990), have continued this theme, with treatments of menopause and aging, breast cancer, and homosexuality.  They repeatedly demonstrate Rainer’s belief in the importance of presenting the female body and the female voice through the critical and self-identifying eye of the female artist.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref68_a1x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Berkeley, CA; 1990-09-12</unittitle><container id="aspace_d6c306d1cc662e07284b260371a14998" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_13324500bddac1be83dd1dfd90faeecf" parent="aspace_d6c306d1cc662e07284b260371a14998" type="videotape">21A-21B, 21B-copy</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rainer_1990-09-12_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Yvonne Rainer, Berkeley, CA; 1990-09-12"><daodesc><p>Yvonne Rainer, Berkeley, CA; 1990-09-12: 1990-09-12</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rainer_1990-09-12_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Yvonne Rainer, Berkeley, CA; 1990-09-12"><daodesc><p>Yvonne Rainer, Berkeley, CA; 1990-09-12: 1990-09-12</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_9d76bbe870d0ad4278bf3c0803cd75bd"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (21A, 21B), DVCAM (21B-copy), Digital .mov files (2)</p></phystech></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref174_l3s" level="file"><did><unittitle>San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rainer_2006-10-24.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Yvonne Rainer, San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24"><daodesc><p>Yvonne Rainer, San Francisco, CA; 2006-10-24: 2006-10-24</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_fbecd8dbc72e1e0a4a05d564221e5519"><head>Format</head><p>Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref141_gsk" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Maura Reilly</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_a90ca6bef94a315edf0afd210482bf2d"><head>Biography</head><p>As the Founding Curator of the Elizabeth A.

Her work incorporates dance, vocals, video, visual effects, and other media as a means to address themes related to animal rights, gender, the environment, and humanity's general place on the planet.  Her current dance ensemble, The Rachel Rosenthal Company, is both a traveling performance group and a method of instruction (utilizing her "Doing by Doing" technique) and outreach.</p><p>Rosenthal has spent much of her career in Los Angeles, a city that, she felt upon moving there, lacked much of the restrictive—and masculine—intensity that New York projected.  In 1956 she founded the Instant Theatre, a decade-long experiment in teaching and innovative, improvisational performance.  In the early years of the feminist art movement in L.A., Rosenthal began collaborating with fellow artists such as Miriam Schapiro and Judy Chicago and helped to found Womanspace Gallery in 1972.  Her realization, by way of these collaborations, that her personal experiences—both psychological and physical—held meaning for others has affected her artwork ever since.  Rosenthal's performance <title render="italic">Charm</title> (1977), for example, was an interpretation of her childhood experiences with deprivation (illustrated by the intimidating figure of her governess) and excess (symbolized by an abundance of pastries and cakes).  In <title render="italic">The Death Show</title> (1978), she explored the theme of death and its constant presence.  <title render="italic">Rachel's Brain</title> (1987) was a costumed musing on human excess and nature's regrettable decline into abstraction, related through Rosenthal's unmistakable stage persona.</p><p>In recent years, Rosenthal has moved away from performing herself, concentrating instead upon painting, artists' books, and artistic direction.  Over the years she has received awards from the City of Los Angeles, the College Art Association, the Women's Caucus, and many other organizations.  She has been included in numerous group shows, including <title render="italic">Los Angeles 1955-1985</title> at the Pompidou Center (2006); many of her works, interviews, and reviews are collected in Moira Roth's monograph <title render="italic">Rachel Rosenthal</title> (1997).</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref72_zrr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</unittitle><container id="aspace_34c3ae49d54c71c23b54f04c51855977" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_23eb72d830eda3ba4b8bb81386322891" parent="aspace_34c3ae49d54c71c23b54f04c51855977" type="videotape">25A</container><container id="aspace_7937d1a01d70fa24d879f5eec30f15b0" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_fc3b53e380221406a09526f0867edd3c" parent="aspace_7937d1a01d70fa24d879f5eec30f15b0" type="videotape">25B, 25C</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p4.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p3.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p6.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p5.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p8.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p7.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1990_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal, Los Angeles, CA; 1990-07-27</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_9646e7f27ce4edf9bd45aef3525c40d2"><head>Format</head><p>Hi-8 (25A), U-matic (25B, 25C)</p></phystech></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref130_epx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unknown Location; 1992-10-03</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Rosenthal_1992-10-03.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Rachel Rosenthal B-roll, Unknown Location; 1992-10-03"><daodesc><p>Rachel Rosenthal B-roll, Unknown Location; 1992-10-03: 1992-10-03</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_aefbc32d0a8657334ab5a15aa6f9c908" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_cfd4f11a7c0387814dd17f98f9eaecfe" parent="aspace_aefbc32d0a8657334ab5a15aa6f9c908" type="videotape">25D</container></did><phystech id="aspace_78efc7a33f329d07a4d066b00db8086f"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (25D), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref37_hqe" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Martha Rosler</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_1824ecd87e382cf95dae636b18934082"><head>Biography</head><p>Martha Rosler (b. 1943) is a performance artist, video artist, and photographer whose practice has focused upon issues of politics, class, and gender.

For example, her OX series from the 1960s presents a set of very basic, abstract symbols of language that also combine to form a rather obvious stylized representation of the female vagina—a second layer of meaning that a viewer could deny but probably not ignore.</p><p>Schapiro created her OX series after a move to Southern California—a life change that brought with it a faculty position at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), where she worked with Judy Chicago to establish the Feminist Art Program in 1971.  Soon after, she and other members of the Program founded Womanhouse, and in 1972 Schapiro co-created the work <title render="italic">Dollhouse</title>, a piece that unapologetically integrated feminine imagery into the core of its meaning.  During the 1970s Schapiro began to incorporate fabric into patchwork assemblages of paint, embroidery, and quilting that she called "femmages."  These works were the starting point for her leadership in the postmodern, abstraction-focused Pattern and Decoration movement, a mode of art making that continued into the 1980s.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref87_8pq" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 1990-05-30</unittitle><container id="aspace_d7a4116e84558c2abea8510f9baea859" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_792137bef57ce75a6a0d09398319f2ce" parent="aspace_d7a4116e84558c2abea8510f9baea859" type="videotape">30A-30B</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Schapiro_1990-05-30_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Miriam Schapiro, New York, NY; 1990-05-30"><daodesc><p>Miriam Schapiro, New York, NY; 1990-05-30: 1990-05-30</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_852bdbb8ceedcd9d29834ab7251fbe5f"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (30A, 30B), Digital .mov files (2)</p></phystech><odd id="aspace_641268705cabedd844ce3cfcd9373bfc"><head>Paper on Container</head><p>Orange post-it stuck to face of container:</p><p>"Problems w/ Master"</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref94_oxu" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 1990-07-02</unittitle><container id="aspace_2a9931c20c6d79e31b2fc6ea06317032" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_52d2374ec2d0d2ba29459a76b5e4e632" parent="aspace_2a9931c20c6d79e31b2fc6ea06317032" type="videotape">30E</container></did><phystech id="aspace_e6cf6b3444b5fa1c904e09c59666757c"><head>Format</head><p>Betacam (30E)</p></phystech><odd id="aspace_aef9ead7f77b958bc591c6b6ef8ccd6f"><head>Paper in Container</head><p>Manufacturer Information and sticker labels</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref175_t3a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles, CA; 1992-09-03</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Schapiro_1992-09-03.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Miriam Schapiro, Los Angeles, CA; 1992-09-03"><daodesc><p>Miriam Schapiro, Los Angeles, CA; 1992-09-03: 1992-09-03</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_8774e0ee6a56dc4ea59c0b9a81cf9bc5" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_10c906d5f2fa40886ca156040f9c1a46" parent="aspace_8774e0ee6a56dc4ea59c0b9a81cf9bc5" type="videotape">30 F</container></did><phystech id="aspace_665401c09cb48154b113f679d342ad4a"><head>Format</head><p>Hi-8 (30F), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref116_7cp" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Miriam Schapiro and Faith Wilding</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref118_njw" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 1990-05-30</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Schapiro_Wilding_1990-05-30_p2.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Miriam Schapiro and Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30"><daodesc><p>Miriam Schapiro and Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30: 1990-05-30</p></daodesc></dao><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Schapiro_Wilding_1990-05-30_p1.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Miriam Schapiro and Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30"><daodesc><p>Miriam Schapiro and Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30: 1990-05-30</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_e0b2b05dff2cd2dec2f7634cefd24716" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_70f11934ce9bf3b7888b32e3402db947" parent="aspace_e0b2b05dff2cd2dec2f7634cefd24716" type="videotape">30C-30D</container></did><phystech id="aspace_6fd67b0f4a074ba8b952bf29b946ba85"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (30C, 30D), Digital .mov files (2)</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref40_k7m" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Carolee Schneemann</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_5315e634cb2ee24ef1ecb9e77e309f11"><head>Biography</head><p>A pioneer of feminist performance art, Carolee Schneemann, b. 1939, works in a wide variety of media including performance, assemblage, photography, film, video, and installation. Throughout her career, her work has found its loci in discourse on the body, sexuality, and gender.  One of her most important early pieces was the multimedia performance work <title render="italic">Meat Joy</title>(1964) which incorporated nude dancers, contemporary popular music, raw meat, and sexual innuendo.  From the same period came her first major film <title render="italic">Fuses</title> (1964-67), considered to be the first feminist erotic film.  Banned and censored in several locales, it portrays the artist and her partner, James Tenney, in bed, watched by their cat, the images interspersed with landscape footage.  Schneemann also burned, baked, cut and painted the film, creating layers of collage.</p><p>Schneemann's flouting of convention was further defined by her later performance <title render="italic">Interior Scroll</title> (1975), in which she unrolled a text from her vagina and described the sexism and disdain women artists encounter in their careers from male colleagues and art critics.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref97_wt7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Copenhagen, Denmark;

She is perhaps best known for her feminist parodies of iconic paintings which incorporate gender reversal in famous themes.  Works that allude to well-known paintings by such masters as Giorgione, Titian and Manet—who all treated the theme of the reclining Venus—depict male rather than female nudes.  Similarly, Sleigh replaced Ingres's nude women in Turkish bath scenes with bathing men.  She used these works to explore the question of values attached to the traditional representations of women and men, and to draw attention to the absence in Western art of erotic portraits of men.  In her many portraits of Paul Rosano, a model she painted many times in the 1970s, Sleigh satirically juxtaposed the idealized stances traditionally given to gods or figure-heads with commonplace contemporary settings.</p><p>In a 2007 interview for Myartspace, Sylvia Sleigh was asked if gender equality issues in the mainstream art world, and the world in general, had changed for the better.  Sleigh answered, "I do think things have improved for women in general; there are many more women in government, in law and corporate jobs, but it’s very difficult in the art world for women to find a gallery."  One of her most well known paintings, <title render="italic">A.I.R. Group Portrait </title>(1977), depicts the members of a gallery (to which she herself belonged) that was founded to begin addressing this inequality.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref206_6ta" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2008-02-28</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_PS1_2008-02-28.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Sylvia Sleigh, New York, NY; 2008-02-28"><daodesc><p>Sylvia Sleigh, New York, NY; 2008-02-28: 2008-02-28</p></daodesc></dao></did><originalsloc id="aspace_c7dee1c32689ff01456cebafe15a371d"><head>Existence and Location of Originals note</head><p>The Sylvia Sleigh interview begins at 00:24:08 and ends at 00:27:54 in the WACK!

In the 1960s much of her work related to the Vietnam War; the War Series (1966-70) depicted rudimentary, phallic bombs and helicopters against plain white backgrounds.  This technique, of drawing or painting isolated images on sheets of paper, sometimes with stamped typography and collage, became her signature.  As, in the 1970s, she began to concentrate solely on the experiences and oppressive treatment of women, she developed a simplified vocabulary of forms: goddesses, gods, animals, monsters, and disembodied heads.  Her work <title render="italic">Torture in Chile</title> (1974), for example, was a pale image of heads, geometric constructions, and snakes, hung below the printed words "Torture in Chile women reaching the Buen Pastor Jail have been subjected to the most brutal tortures live mice and insects introduced into vaginas hair pulled out by the handfuls nipples blown off or burnt genitals destroyed by electricity."</p><p>Spero's political interests in the 1970s ran parallel to the subjects that she was exploring in her artwork.  In 1969 she joined the Art Workers Coalition, an organization that worked to address iniquities in the art world and in society in general (one of its main causes being an end to the Vietnam War).  She also became active in Women Artists in Revolution and, in 1972, co-founded Artists in Residence (A.I.R.) Gallery, a cooperative exhibition space in New York for women artists.</p><p>Spero has received awards from the College Art Association, the Women's Caucus for Art, Skowhegan, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  Her work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref188_9az" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2008-02-18</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Spero_2008-02-18.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Nancy Spero, New York, NY; 2008-02-18"><daodesc><p>Nancy Spero, New York, NY; 2008-02-18</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_606a6b487dd58903b8159bad2b7ccfd1"><head>Format</head><p>Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref133_rsi" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Marcia Tucker</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_472eb005e39c79fdc56e7e0170707be3"><head>Biography</head><p>Marcia Tucker (1940-2006) was a curator and founder of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, an institution she directed for twenty-two years.  Both her curatorial practice and her museum held as a philosophical underpinning the notion that contemporary art and its exhibition should be challenging conceptually and, often, politically. Tucker's practice of this belief in the organization of a Richard Tuttle exhibition led, at least indirectly, to her dismissal from a curatorship at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1977—a development that was her impetus to create the New Museum.  In her role as director she oversaw the mounting of such exhibitions as <title render="italic">Bad Painting</title> (1978) and <title render="italic">Bad Girls</title> (1994), the catalog for the latter of which contained an essay by Tucker titled "The Attack of the Giant Ninja Mutant Barbies." Her engagement with feminist art was sometimes direct (the aforementioned show and her rumored involvement with the Guerrilla Girls being two examples) but often more subtle, an implicit component of her mission to support the radical in art.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref134_iid" level="file"><did><unittitle>Santa Barbara, CA; 2006-07-26</unittitle><container id="aspace_757770848998ea7477e7651b4e859db4" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_7152e14fb3f16918d24a46db27b24845" parent="aspace_757770848998ea7477e7651b4e859db4" type="videotape">32A</container><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Tucker_2006-07-26.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Marcia Tucker, Santa Barbara, CA; 2006-07-26"><daodesc><p>Marcia Tucker, Santa Barbara, CA; 2006-07-26: 2006-07-26</p></daodesc></dao></did><phystech id="aspace_6093835b0a9d8ac4e04e9ee99ffdbcad"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (32A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref189_fa2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Camille Utterback</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_88e6b998df499b7fbd5fab395eae3fb4"><head>Biography</head><p>Camille Utterback (b. 1970) is an artist and programmer in the field of interactive installation.

When Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro founded the Feminist Art Program—which they began at California State University, Fresno in 1970 and then moved to the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 1971—Wilding was one of its first graduate students.  The program’s first major project, Womanhouse (1971-72) was a defining moment in Wilding’s career.  Her sculpture <title render="italic">Crocheted Environment</title> (1972), installed in one of the house's rooms, formed an archetypal womb-like structure around its viewers, the feminine connotations of which were enforced by her use of crochet in its construction.  It is illustrative of Wilding's interest in highlighting women's maternal, domestic, and often communal roles in society—sometimes to complicate or question them, sometimes to celebrate them.</p><p>More recently Wilding has focused specifically upon the ways in which bodies, and particularly women's bodies, are affected by the encroachment of technology upon biology.  She has published essays relating to the topic and created works such as <title render="italic">Recombinants</title> (1992-96), a set of drawings depicting humans that have melded with machines, plants, and animals.  subRosa, an artists' collaborative of which she is a member, creates works relating to biotechnology and women's health, women's representation in politics and the media, and other issues—all relating to what it terms "cyberfeminism."</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref115_76j" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 1990-05-30</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Wilding_1990-05-30.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30"><daodesc><p>Faith Wilding, New York, NY; 1990-05-30: 1990-05-30</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_0de2ebb9d90b5d730653a4a0fda097e3" label="moving images" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_50da8cd997f5d6953a1d10bc177a93f6" parent="aspace_0de2ebb9d90b5d730653a4a0fda097e3" type="videotape">33A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_67d9d2d92ae2c7750d948bebb4671c30"><head>Format</head><p>U-matic (33A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref41_1k9" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Martha Wilson</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_ref145_55z" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY; 2006-05-12</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Wilson_2006-05-12.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Martha Wilson, New York, NY; 2006-05-12"><daodesc><p>Martha Wilson, New York, NY; 2006-05-12: 2006-05-12</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_454064d55e53fa06891a7ccf4c508b98" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_d94b538d7583b867980ed12e3932ae73" parent="aspace_454064d55e53fa06891a7ccf4c508b98" type="videotape">34A</container></did><phystech id="aspace_2ba97ed2f66784cef366e30052183d25"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (34A), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref109_bbq" level="file"><did><unittitle>New York, NY, 2008-02-15</unittitle><dao audience="internal" xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="M1639_Wilson_2008-02-15.mov" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Martha Wilson, New York, NY, 2008-02-15"><daodesc><p>Martha Wilson, New York, NY, 2008-02-15: 2008-02-15</p></daodesc></dao><container id="aspace_b903c62ae725c104c8429aabdfb017cc" label="moving images" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_0be1b333c7d96e3bd892109b837db8df" parent="aspace_b903c62ae725c104c8429aabdfb017cc" type="videotape">34B</container></did><phystech id="aspace_748d3f4152d50579ea8a5d4ea30fb62a"><head>Format</head><p>Mini-DV (34B), Digital .mov file</p></phystech></c03></c02></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref225_c5x" level="series"><did><unittitle>Transcripts</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">53 item(s)</extent></physdesc><container id="aspace_56d30cb60bf4346b4ff608b0d88bcba4" label="Text" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_5d2145952250ba62f2ac9d420b503c95" parent="aspace_56d30cb60bf4346b4ff608b0d88bcba4" type="folders">1-46</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9bbfe290cccffa6f904b8702b6b2b003"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This series includes transcripts for most videos in the collection except:</p><p>Judith Brodsky</p><p>Cornelia Butler 2008</p><p>Beatriz da Costa</p><p>DISBAND performance</p><p>Guerrilla Girls 2008</p><p>Harmony Hammond</p><p>Alanna Heiss</p><p>Yael Kanarek</p><p>Sheila Levrant de Bretteville 2008</p><p>Lucy Lippard</p><p>Rachel Rosenthal</p><p>Martha Rosler 2008</p><p>Carolee Schneeman</p><p>Sylvia Sleigh</p><p>Nancy Spero</p><p>Camille Utterback</p><p>Cecilia Vicuna</p><p>WACK!
