    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Fred W. Ross was born August 23, 1910 in San Francisco to Fred W. and Daisy C. Ross. He grew up in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and attended Belmont High School until 1929. An English literature and social science major, he graduated from the University of Southern California in 1937.</p><p>Giving up his original plan to become a teacher because he could not find a job during the Depression, Ross became a caseworker with the state relief administration. In 1939 he became the manager of the Arvin Migratory Labor Camp near Bakersfield, the same camp John Steinbeck drew on to write The Grapes of Wrath. Ross encouraged the inhabitants to organize themselves. In 1941 he began to work for the War Relocation Authority helping Japanese American internees leave the camps and obtain jobs and housing.</p><p>In 1946 Ross went to work for the American Council on Race Relations to promote "Councils for Civic Unity" in California in response to the racial tensions that had surfaced during the war. The eight Hispanic Unity Leagues Ross organized fought segregation in schools and elsewhere. From 1947 to 1952 he worked for Saul Alinsky and the Industrial Areas Foundation. With their support Ross established the first Community Service Organization in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles. In 1952 he met Cesar Chavez, then a young man in San Jose, and hired him. Both men founded 22 CSO chapters throughout California in the 1950's. As a decades-long mentor, Ross had a strong influence on Chavez, who remembered that "as time went on, Fred became sort of my hero. I saw him organize and I wanted to learn."</p><p>In 1964 Ross was hired by the National Presbyterian Church to establish a community self-help group in Guadalupe, Arizona, a poor small town, populated by Yaqui Indians and Mexican Americans, where the church owned much property. The following year, 1965-66, Ross taught community organizing at Syracuse University in the first course of its kind. In 1966 Ross began his work with Cesar Chavez's UFW, training hundreds of organizers. He organized many well-known strikes and boycotts, among them the Giumarra strike of 1967, the grape boycott of 1968, the lettuce strikes of 1970 and 1973, and the Gallo wine boycott of 1973.</p><p>In 1978 Ross directed Jerry Brown's campaign for governor of California. Ross helped to organize the United Domestic Workers of America and the 1979 Chiquita Banana Boycott. In 1984 he became involved with Nuclear Freeze, Jobs with Peace, CISPES (Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador). He also worked with the anti-interventionist group Neighbor to Neighbor with his son, Fred Ross, Jr.</p><p>Ross developed and taught organizing techniques such as the house meeting. This work is well-documented in the Papers. In 1989 Neighbor to Neighbor published Ross' Axioms for Organizers as a booklet. The same year, El Taller Grafico press (UFW) pubished Ross' first book, Conquering Goliath: Cesar Chavez at the Beginning.</p><p>In 1937 Ross married Yvonne Gregg; they divorced shortly after the birth of their son, Robert, in 1940. Ross married Frances Gibson in 1943, and they had three children, Julia, Fred, Jr., and Rob. Fred Ross died on September 27, 1992. He was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2014.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Ross Papers comprise the personal and professional materials of Fred Ross and occupy approximately 25 linear feet.</p><p>The general condition of the papers reflects Ross' peripatetic lifestyle as an organizer. Before being acquired by Stanford, the Ross papers were stored in various locations; a few of the papers have extensive water and mold damage. Many of the files and papers are incomplete, break off suddenly, or have had to be reconstructed or reorganized. The general organization of the papers is also affected by the fact that Ross suffered from Alzheimer's disease at the end of his life. Often he went back and relabelled files, sometimes erroneously; when these errors were obvious, they were corrected in the folder title. In going through many of his files, Ross removed items to use for his autobiographical manuscripts and then did not replace them. This means that some files have obvious gaps. When the missing materials could clearly be identified, they were put back with the larger files to which they belonged. When the provenance of stray items could not be easily determined, they were filed by themselves or, when found in a group, filed together with other "missing pieces" under titles such as "misc. manuscript pages" or "organizing materials (without organization names)." Overall the processor followed the principle of preserving as much of the original order as possible and leaving it to the individual researcher to determine what may belong together.</p><p>The Manuscript and Audiotape Series may be the richest for researchers. It is here that Ross' organizing work and personal experience are most fully documented.</p>  </scopecontent>

Another small collection of Ross' papers is held by the Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit. This collection includes daily field activity reports documenting Ross's training of Chavez as an organizer for the Community Service Organization from 1954 to 1965 and an untitled manuscript, written around 1973, about Chavez and his early work in the organization of farm workers.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

The manuscripts are mostly autobiographical. He often wrote of himself in the third person or as "you" in an interior dialogue putting the reader in Ross's place. His writings include extensive portraits of Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta (see "Woman in Motion").</p><p>One of the original boxes in the collection bore the note that "this box contains the papers Fred worked and reworked in the 1990's-they are mostly as he left them. We can't really discern what he truly wanted as final drafts -he reworked his writings for decades." This is true of the entire Manuscript Series. Because Ross' manuscripts were work in progress and often undated, it can be difficult to discern the order in which drafts were written. Moreover, some manuscripts have missing pages that were presumably taken out as Ross worked to revise his writings, or the pages were lost in the course of his many moves. Due to the number of manuscripts, any missing pages are not noted in the guide.</p><p>The manuscript titles listed in the guide reflect the title listed on the document itself, but sometimes drafts of the same story carried different titles. Another complication is that Ross often wrote in a style that used many short chapters or frequent subheadings, so that every few pages brings a new title and it is not clear what the title of the whole manuscript was. In this case, only the title given on the first page is listed. Finally, there are numerous untitled manuscripts listed in the guide. In most cases these are missing the first few pages; often the untitled manuscripts are versions of documents that have titles, but the processor has left this decision to the judgement of the individual researcher.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref435_7md" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Autobiographical."

Many of the notes are not clearly labelled or dated. Some appear to be logs of his organizing work, but most are Ross' own sketched notes and outlines for meetings and training sessions.

The contents of the tapes' labels have been listed here, although not all are fully labeled. The undated cassettes are grouped together at the end of the series. Where it was obvious that an undated tape belonged with a group of dated tapes, the undated tape was put with them, with the presumed date indicated in brackets. In more dubious cases, the undated tapes were put at the end of the series.</p><p>The tapes are rich in autobiographical materials and in histories of the farm workers' movement.
