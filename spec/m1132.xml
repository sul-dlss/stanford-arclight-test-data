    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Nathaniel Tarn Papers are a particularly rich collection of materials, gathered over nearly sixty years of Tarn's highly-varied and well-respected career. The Papers include manuscripts of his published and unpublished poetry and prose, notebooks from his anthropological fieldwork, and correspondence with his personal friends, literary colleagues, and fellow anthropologists. Also included are audio-visual material and ephemera, as well as a complete set of his publications, in book as well as in periodical form. The collection arrived at Stanford accompanied by Tarn's own detailed listing of the contents, organized into three main series: Books and Manuscripts; Literary Correspondence; and, Anthropology and General Scholarship. To this end, Tarn's original organization and description is duplicated verbatim, with only a few minor editorial corrections changing the text. Unlisted and un-described materials found in the original accession, along with material added subsequently, have been inserted where deemed appropriate. Folder titles and descriptive text added during the processing of the Papers appear within brackets, typically with an explanatory statement. In addition, a fourth series was created for a separate listing of Audio-Visual Materials for tapes, compact disks, and film not originally listed or described by Tarn. Scope and content of the particular series follow below.</p><p>The 2006-2011 accessions consist of correspondence, notebooks, poems, diaries, calendars, daybooks, unpublished prose, books, journals, Avia drafts and related materials, Scandals in the House of Birds materials and typescript, miscellaneous drafts and proofs, cds, reel to reel film, Nathaniel Tarn's Ph.D. thesis, and some of Tarn's teaching materials.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Nathaniel Tarn was born in Paris, France in 1928. His childhood in Belgium was disrupted in 1939, when the threat of World War II prompted the family's removal to England. After graduating in history and English from King's College, Cambridge, Tarn studied anthropology, first at the Sorbonne and then as a Smith-Mundt-Fulbright Scholar at the University of Chicago, where he completed his doctoral degree based on fieldwork in the Mayan region of Guatemala. Further work in anthropology followed, with extensive research on Buddhist culture in Burma. Upon his return to England, Tarn received a teaching appointment to the London School of Economics, followed by a professorship at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). In addition to his expertise in the Highland Maya area and South East Asia, Tarn has also worked in the Himalayan region, China, Japan, Cuba, and Alaska.</p><p>After publishing his first volume of poetry Old Savage/Young City in 1964 and a celebrated translation of Pablo Neruda's The Heights of Macchu Picchu in 1966, Tarn decided to concentrate his energies on literature. He served as the General Editor of Cape Editions and the Founding Editor of Cape-Goliard Press in London from 1967 until 1969, then returned to the United States in 1970. Two years later he accepted a professorship in comparative literature at Rutgers, which he held until his retirement in 1985. Today he lives outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, remaining a creative and energetic force in modern poetry and the study of world literature.</p><p>As poet, essayist, translator, and editor, Tarn has published some twenty-five books, including an anthology of his collected essays in literary and cultural criticism, Views from the Weaving Mountain (1991). He is the recipient of numerous awards including the Guinness prize (1963), Wenner Gren fellowship (1978, 1980), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania fellowship (1984), and a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship.</p>  </bioghist>

Literary Correspondence</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c3367e184cdb45b9a343c29726711f3b"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Unlike Series I, the next two series are further divided by Tarn into subseries, listed alphabetically and topical in substance. Series II is rather long and complex, with Subseries Q, not originally divided by Tarn, further broken down into five subsubseries to accommodate textual headings denoted in the original listing. In general, the first group of Subseries, A-K, represents a geographic breakdown of individual and group correspondence, and includes American, British, French, European, Latin American, and Australian authors. The next set of Subseries, L-O, includes Literary Critics, Artists, Scholars, and Orientalists of all nationalities. Subseries P, Publishing Files, covers Tarn's stint as editor for Jonathan Cape, London/ Richard Grossman, New York. The aforementioned Subseries Q holds files relating to Other Publishers, Radio Scripts, Other Scripts, Newspapers and Periodicals, and Miscellaneous Files. Typically, all the subseries in Literary Correspondence contain correspondence, typescript and manuscript material, drafts, copies of same, and proofs. Occasionally, there is more material present in a folder than Tarn's original listing, and, if identifiable, duly noted within brackets. Over 450 correspondents are represented in the Literary Correspondence Series, with significant material from authors and poets such as: Lee Bartlett, John Brandi, Clayton Eshelman, Kenneth Irby, Pablo Neruda, Toby Olson, Octavio Paz, Jerome Rothenberg, Gary Snyder, Arnold Wesker, Hans Ten Berge, and Elliot Weinberger. Other notable authors, scholars, and poets within the Series include: Hannah Arendt, Andre Breton, John Digby, Robert Duncan, Anselm Hollo, Ted Hughes, Edward Lucie-Smith, Jackson Mac Low, Michael McClure, Edward McDiarmid, Assia Wevill, and David Wevill. Subseries P, concerning Tarn's editorship, holds letters, notes, contracts, reports, financial statements, and other material regarding the establishment of Cape Goliard Press, along with a collection of proofs and drafts from Ted Berrigan, Michel Butor, Allen Ginsburg, Louis Zukofsky, and others. In the first of five subsubseries within Subseries Q, Other Publishers, correspondence regarding the publishing of Tarn's work with publishers such as American Poetry Books, Brillig Works Press, Jonathan Cape, Chax Press, Coffee House Press, Farrar Strauss, New Directions, Ninja Press, and Random House (mostly with Nan Talese), is found here, as well as Radio Scripts by Paul Celan, Ted Hughes, and Peter Redgrove. Additionally, Other Scripts features work by Lee Bartlett, Lindsay Hill, Jed Rasula, and Philipe Soupalt, and includes many poems and discussion sheets from the 1960s United Kingdom meetings of "The Group." Within Newspapers and Periodicals, correspondence, typescript, and proofs regarding publication of articles in ACTS, Conjunctions, First Intensity, Les Lettres Nouvelles, The Times of London, and other publications are listed. The fifth subsubseries, Miscellaneous Files, gathers together General Correspondence from 1957 through 2000 with several files of individual correspondence not included in the original accession; Poetry Reading Files, from the early 1960s through the 1990s; scripts of BBC radio broadcasts from the 1950s and 1960s; and Job Offer Files, 1969-1981. Also included here are files covering Tarn's early employment by This Week In Paris (under the pseudonym Michel Tavriger), 1948-1952; poetry festivals, conferences, and readings attended, 1963-2000; and miscellaneous material including an index card file of Tarn's early publications; correspondence with Chax Press regarding the publishing of Architextures, received in a later accession; page proofs of Tarn's 1990 translation of Pablo Neruda's Four Odes One Song; photocopied newspaper and journal articles; greeting cards, announcements, etc.; artwork and photographs; and a file of unidentified, photocopied typescipt and magazine interviews with several poets.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref524_smi" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A.

Among the anthropological correspondents are found: Isaac Chiva, Stanley Diamond, Fred Eggan, Sir Raymond Firth, Sir Edmund Leach, Claude Levi-Strauss, Margaret Mead, Robert Redfield, and nearly two hundred others. In addition, correspondence and material relating to Tarn's academic and professional transition from anthropology to comparative literature, his strong interest in Buddhism, lecture notes from his own undergraduate and graduate training, and later course material from teaching assignments at Rutgers University during the 1970s-1980s, are found in this series.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref2218_miu" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries R.
