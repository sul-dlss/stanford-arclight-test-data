            <abstract id="ref110" label="Abstract">This collection consists of the papers of Samuel A. Moment, which he used in his capacity of Economic Analyst for the Temporary National Economic Committee (T.N.E.C.), specifically in the Committee's investigation into the domestic copper industry. The T.N.E.C. was an inter-agency committee with representatives from both Houses of Congress and the Departments of: Justice, Labor, Treasury and Commerce, Federal Trade Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission. It was created pusuant to Public Resolution 113 (1938 June 16), a joint resolution of the 75th Congress, which in turn was a result of a Presidential Message from Roosevelt concerning the necessity of "strengthening and enforcement of Antitrust Laws (1938 Apr 29). The duty of the Committee, as described in Public Resolution 113, was to investigate monopolies and the concentration of economic power and financial, which investigation would lead to recommendations to Congress of possible legislation to rectify the situation.</abstract>
