            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Incoming correspondence to Sri D.R. Sukul, numerous manuscripts and pamphlets relating to eastern philosophies and religions (originally part of the library of the Yoga Institute of America), and material concerning nutrition and color and their effect on the mind and body (one of Sukul's primary interests). Also represented are personal projects that Evans was involved with, including the Famine Relief Program for India in 1967, research on John Howard Payne, and the Olympic Manufacturing Co. There are also some scrapbooks relating to her husband's tenure as publisher of a Stockton, California newspaper, 1938-1940. Material from the Yoga Institute's library includes numerous East Indian book dealer catalogs and a large pamphlet collection on yoga and its practitioners. There are photographs of Sukul, a photo album of his visit to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, and an oil painting representing him.</abstract>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Evans, secretary to the Yoga Institute of America while Sri Deva Ram Sukul was president, became president on Sukul's death on Nov. 12, 1965 when the headquarters was moved to her home in Santa Barbara from New York. It had been Evans' hope that the Yoga Institute library would eventually be associated with a research institution, and shortly before her death she arranged for the collection of books and papers to come to Stanford University.</p>
