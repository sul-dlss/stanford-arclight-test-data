        <bioghist id="bioghist"><head>Biography/Administrative History</head><p>In November 1966, a group of map librarians met at UC Berkeley to discuss the possibility of creating an organization specifically for map librarians in the western United States and provinces of Canada. The Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML) was officially founded in 1967. The original intent of this organization was to encourage high standards in every phase of the organization and administration of map libraries by: providing for the discussion of mutual problems and interests through meetings and publications; exchanging information on experiences, ideas, and methods; encouraging higher production standards of map manufacturers; and establishing and improving standards of professional service in this field.
Membership in WAML is open to any person who appreciates or works with maps and cartographic information in print or digital formats is invited to join the Western Association of Map Libraries. All members receive access the &quot;Information Bulletin&quot;, which is typically published three times per year. As the &quot;Information Bulletin&quot; moves to an online format, members receive access to a &quot;members only&quot; section of the publication online.
Currently, WAML holds meetings once a year, though in the past meetings frequently occurred twice per year. The location of the meetings is varied in the western United States and Canada.
In addition to the &quot;Information Bulletin&quot;, WAML has published fourteen &quot;Occasional Papers and News &amp; Notes&quot;, a bimonthly web-based newsletter that includes time-sensitive items such as cataloging news, information about new mapping products, employment opportunities, and mapping agency news.
The Western Association of Map Libraries is currently defined on their website as &quot;an independent association of map librarians and other people with an interest in maps and map librarianship. Membership in WAML is open to any individual interested in furthering the purpose of the Association, which is &quot;to encourage high standards in every phase of the organization and administration of map libraries.&quot; (http://www.waml.org).</p></bioghist>
