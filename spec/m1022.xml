      <head>Biography</head>
      <p>Novelist, short-story writer, dramatist, and essayist, William Saroyan was born in Fresno, California in 1908. A high-school dropout, Saroyan was largely self-educated and decided at an early age to pursue a career as a writer, drawing on his experience as an Armenian-American growing up in California.</p>
      <p>His first published works were sketches in
<title linktype="simple">The Overland Monthly </title>in 1928, which inspired him to seek his fortune in New York City. In 1934
<title linktype="simple">Story Magazine </title>printed "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze." The immediate public acclaim led to publication of the collection
<title linktype="simple">The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze and Other Stories </title>(1934) by Random House. He followed this success with two more short story collections in 1936,
<title linktype="simple">Three Times Three </title>and
<title linktype="simple">Inhale and Exhale. </title></p>
      <p>Transforming one of these stories into his first dramatic production,
<title linktype="simple">My Heart's in the Highlands </title>(1939), Saroyan then wrote
<title linktype="simple">The Time of Your Life </title>(1939-40), for which he received both New York Drama Critics' Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. The same year he released the story collection,
<title linktype="simple">My Name is Aram </title>(1940), a Book of the Month Club selection.</p>
      <p>In late 1941 Saroyan agreed to work for Louis B. Mayer in Hollywood. This resulted both in the Oscar-winning MGM film,
<title linktype="simple">The Human Comedy, </title>(1943) as well as the popular novelized version of the original screenplay, published by Harcourt Brace simultaneously with the movie's opening.</p>
      <p>Drafted into the army, Saroyan was stationed during part of World War II in London, where he wrote the controversial anti-war book,
<title linktype="simple">The Adventures of Wesley Jackson </title>(1946). Through the 1950s he continued to produce plays, short stories, and novels. He then turned to personal memoirs to express himself, producing in succession
<title linktype="simple">The Bicycle Rider in Beverly Hills </title>(1952),
<title linktype="simple">Here Comes, There Goes, You Know Who </title>(1961),
<title linktype="simple">Not Dying </title>(1963), and
<title linktype="simple">Obituaries </title>(1980), which was nominated for the American Book Award. A final volume of reminiscence,
<title linktype="simple">Births </title>(1983), was published posthumously.</p>

Elsewhere, a song, "Jericho"; poem written to Tchykovsky [sic] [see letters to Coates that Saroyan was attempting to transmute this music into a poem]. Notes on a novel HOME IN THE VALLEY; a very interesting note on his lifelong habit of drawing, but with specific reference to the early line drawings: "My line drawings disclose one fact indubitably: I am unconsciously concerned with precision, finality, harmony, and perfection; as much concerned unconsciously as consciously. I sometimes see great beauty in the drawings, and at other times I regard them as flat, monotonous, pointless: I think the difference is the result of the manner in which I go to the drawings...[and on...]." He is 25 at this time. Notes on motion pictures. WILLIAM SAROYAN / a novel by William Saroyan. "The Last Words of Christ"; "Thou Sayest" a story. Review of Arlen; negative notes on Charles Dobie play.

          <p>29 pp. have entries. On Dreiser and his own National Guard experiences at Monterey, recounting events from the year 1926, when he was exceptionally lonely, wanted a girl, but not a chippy. Acknowledging his own brilliant mind, his own normal human longings. He recalls meeting a girl in a park. His heart pounded. "It would have pounded for a colored girl - from a distance [!!] or for an old maid." But he could not summon the courage to speak to her, walked away; and when later he ran back to find her, she was gone, forever. A touchingly related "naive" anecdote of great importance to WS. "...the following night I was not quite the same young man I had been. I had, it seemed, grown terrifically  Now that I look back on this trivial incident I realize that it was after that evening that I accepted ugliness in my life." Other incidents recalled. On "mafather". "Little Miss Universe" horse story.</p>

On Friday Sept 22 he records "typed out a story (Daring Young Man...) which I think is pretty fair and much better than most stories of its kind: hunger and death unsentimentally. I am planning to send It to 'Story', edited by Whit Burnett; the note is already written; all I need is a few envelopes and stamps." Contents of EUROPEAN CAR VAN is outlined in this notebook, as if he had gotten it from the library, could not afford a copy, this was his way of remembering. On his cousin Vahan. On Sept. 25 he writes "Myself Upon the Earth" which would appear in DARING YOUNG MAN. He now is walking to the public library &amp; recording from newspapers and periodicals names to be used in his work. Cigarettes are good for one thing only: precision. Expects mail from Sanora Babb. He dreams "moving pictures" recorded here.</p>

          <p>77 pp. have entries. A new program of writing begins based on a favorable letter from Edward J. O'Brien. He will write a book of short stories about Armenians. Three days later he has submitted 3 such stories to O. Henry editor. Then he outlines HOME IN THE VALLEY, a novel of Armenians in the San Joaquin valley. Each day sees another story completed, virtually. With notes for more sprinkled throughout. 11 titles listed, after about a week in this notebook, along with an introduction for "Sirak Goryan." He loses 74 cents gambling, a lot of money for him. Self-analysis and interesting biographical notes intrude. He has begun to submit to Hairenik, and admits to putting in considerable effort on stories. Writing is revealed as not easy, but painstakingly arduous. But its a short story a day nonetheless, and he is re-writing as well. "getting turkey consignments for Christmas trade." "The Broken Wheel" will be reprinted by E.J. O'Brien. WS notes titles of 5 songs by Paul Robeson.. On Dec 13, 1933 Whit Burnett accepts 'The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" for Story Magazine. Saroyan receives a $15 check. Now Saroyan recalls &amp; records 16 kids names from Class 2b, Laguna Honda School; a profusion of notes follow, including "(Tristram Shandy - not to be forgotten.)". Another string of recollected names: "Norris Ennis (has a large penis)." "Seventy Thousand Assyrians" mailed to Story. "Good tale, I think." He sees Henry his brother on occasion during these months.</p>

          <p>42 pp. have entries in purple ink. Gets his shoes resoled &amp; begins "Dear Greta Garbo" (in DARING YOUNG MAN); writes to Flores, Winters, Babb. He gives a resume of the year over several pages; work &amp; places visited; no women intrude. Now another string of stories for the immediate future are outlined, including "Dear Papa: story: a child's letters." "I opened a can of tomatoes (large can) squeezed the juice of two lemons over it &amp; ate with French bread, salt, pepper, very fine - must remember to repeat. I can tomatoes 13 cents; and a damn fine sort of food." Then 15 titles "not yet used." He targets editors around the country for ballyhoo: "remember the cinema - it is changing the style of life." A film spurs him to write "Sinking to His Knees" - a long notebook entry, camera conscious. "1933. Annie Doesn't Live Here Anymore - a story." Then WS cleans his room "finally" - goes for another walk. Writes O.O. McIntyre.</p>
