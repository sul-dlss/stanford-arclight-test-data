         <p>Arjay Miller was the fourth dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business (1969-1979). Miller led Stanford Graduate School of Business into the top ranks of management education institutions, expanded its endowment, and created the often copied Public Management Program.</p>
         <p>Arjay Miller was born on a farm in Shelby, Nebraska, on March 4, 1916. He earned his bachelor’s degree from UCLA in 1937 and then worked part-time as a teaching assistant at UC Berkeley before becoming an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He then served for three years in the U.S. Air Force before joining Ford Motor Co. in 1946. Miller worked with the automobile giant for 23 years, serving as president in the early 1960. He was lured away to become dean of Stanford GSB, arriving on July 1, 1969. He remained dean until he stepped down in July of 1979.</p>
