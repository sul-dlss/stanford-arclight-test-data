         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Stanford has been touched by the events of September 11 in countless ways. As a country, we have declared a war against terrorism. As individuals, we struggle with sorrow and anger, with compassion for victims in the U.S. but also compassion for victims in Afghanistan. As a generation, we now have an event that has indelibly marked our private and civic consciousness.</p>
         <p>In conjunction with the Department of International Relations, some of Stanford’s most prominent political organizations will jointly sponsor a new course being offered in the winter quarter to focus on the most salient questions we must ask ourselves in the wake of September 11. Discussions within our organizations and with others have demonstrated keen student interest in a course that would address why and how our world and our generation have changed since terrorist attacks struck Washington and New York. Student-initiated IR-193 "Understanding September 11: Its Causes, Context and Consequences," will feature student-led discussion sections, as well as weekly lectures by experts on a wide array of topics. Students will have the option of taking the course for either 1 or 2 units. The emphasis will be on dialogue not only between students and faculty, but amongst students themselves.</p>

                  <p>Who is Osama bin Laden? What is the Al-Qaeda network, and how and why did it form? How do we know who was responsible? What is terrorism? Were the September 11 attacks an act of terrorism or war, both from the perspective of the terrorists and from the perspective of the U.S. government? How does defining the 9-11 attacks as an "act of war" affect how America can and/or should respond?</p>
                  <p>Discussion: What was the motivation behind the attacks? Does the U.S. have the political, ethical and legal right to kill bin Laden? How has the media affected how we understand the terrorist "network" and bin Laden’s role in it, and how can we evaluate such portrayal? Was 9-11 an act of terrorism or of war?</p>

                  <p>How does America’s crisis response system operate? What is the role of the National Security Council? State Department? CIA? Pentagon? Who made decisions on how to respond to 9-11? What factors influenced their decisions? What alternatives were discussed?</p>
                  <p>Discussion: What should be the goals of a response? What considerations do decision-makers face? How do we evaluate their final decisions, both from the vantage of the decision-makers, and from our own vantage point (with the benefit of hindsight but the disadvantage of incomplete information)? What is the "propaganda war"?</p>

                  <p>This session provides students who have no theoretical background with a framework for understanding the new developments in international relations, insofar as they relate directly to the aftermath of 9-11. Has 9-11 altered the way that we conceive of the international system? How can "states" fight a terrorist "network"? This session will explain changes in inter-state relations between the great powers and security structures, specifically NATO, EU member countries, Britain, Russia, and China. Can an enduring coalition be built among these players?</p>
                  <p>Discussion: How can we evaluate these shifts in international relations? How much has actually changed? Is the "coalition against terrorism" enduring or transient? What will the system look like over the next several years?</p>

                  <p>What is "nation-building"? In what historical perspective are America’s decisions about nation-building in Afghanistan in a historical perspective (Vietnam, East Timor, etc.) placed? The political, ethical, security and ideological considerations about intervention and nation-building. What stance is America taking with respect to Central Asia and other places that harbor terrorism? What has been the role of international organizations? Does this affect how the U.S. interacts with non-democratic regimes?</p>
                  <p>Discussion: Is America’s foreign policy changing, and how? How do we now view our role in nation-building and conflict resolution? What is/should be America’s role in Afghanistan? What is the emerging role of United Nations and international non-governmental organizations?</p>

                  <p>How did 9-11 psychologically affect individual Americans? How do these psychological effects affect American society, economy and culture? How have the new domestic security concerns—heightened security, the anthrax threat, the sudden awakening to our vulnerability—affected how we live our lives? Did it/will it change the American character in the way that Vietnam did, and for how long? What will patriotism mean?</p>
