         <head>Biographical/Historical Sketch</head>
         <p>Philip Zimbardo was born on March 23, 1933 in New York City. He attended Brooklyn College
        where he earned a B.A. in 1954, triple majoring in psychology, sociology and anthropology.
        He then went on to earn his M.A. in 1955 and his Ph.D. in 1959 from Yale University, both in
        psychology.</p>
         <p>He taught briefly at Yale before becoming a psychology professor at New York University,
        where he taught until 1967. After a year of teaching at Columbia University, he became a
        faculty member at Stanford University in 1968.</p>
         <p>Philip Zimbardo is perhaps best known for the Stanford Prison Experiment, conducted in the
        basement of the Stanford University psychology department in 1971. The participants in the
        study were 24 male college students who were randomly assigned to act either as "guards" or
        "prisoners" in the mock prison.</p>
         <p>The study was initially slated to last two weeks, but had to be terminated after just six
        days because of the extreme reactions and behaviors of the participants. The guards began
        displaying cruel and sadistic behavior toward the prisoners, while the prisoners became
        depressed and hopeless.</p>
         <p>Since the famous prison experiment, Zimbardo has continued to conduct research on a variety
        of topics including shyness, cult behavior and heroism. He has a authored and co-authored
        numerous books, including some that are widely used in university level psychology courses.
        Some people may recognize him as the host of the <title render="italic">Discovering
          Psychology</title> video series, which has aired on PBS and is often used in high school
        and college psychology classes. In 2002, Zimbardo was elected president of the American
        Psychological Association. After more than 50 years of teaching, Zimbardo retired from
        Stanford in 2003 but gave his last "Exploring Human Nature" lecture on March 7, 2007.</p>
         <p>Today, he continues to work as the director of the organization he founded called the
        Heroic Imagination Project. The organization promotes research, education and media
        initiatives designed to inspire ordinary people to act as heroes and agents of social
        change.</p>

                     <p>Allen Funt and Phil Zimbardo have selected a set of classic scenarios from <title render="italic">Candid Camera</title> that illustrate basic themes and principles
                in psychology. The 17 selections for Introductory Psychology focus on topics such as
                expectations, memory, methodology, bias, selective perception, problem solving, and
                more. The 16 selections for Social Psychology cover a range of themes: conformity,
                compliance, obedience, construction of social reality, persuasion, expert influence,
                and others. </p>

                  <p>Audiorecordings consist primarily of cassettes and reels of Zimbardo's lectures and
              talks. Classroom lectures include several from Psychology 1 and other courses he
              taught at Stanford. Professional talks include those given at APA conferences and
              other symposia and lectures. Recordings include interviews with Zimbardo, and many of
              his appearances on NPR radio programming. </p>

                  <p>The Stanford Shyness Clinic (now, the Shyness Clinic) began functioning around 1975
              in Zimbardo's laboratory in Jordan Hall, where Stanford students (answering an ad in
              the Stanford Daily newspaper) were treated in small groups of 6-8 for a fixed-time
              period of 8 weeks. Since Zimbardo was not a licensed clinician, the clinic started as
              an "experimental" treatment center, where no money was exchanged, and the team tried
              different strategies and tactics with different groups of clients, explicitly
              indicating this to the clients. Meg Marnell served as Zimbardo's co-therapist; she was
              trained in behavioral counseling at the School of Education. After several years of
              rather good success in helping virtually all clients improve one or more aspects of
              their social functioning, the team expanded to include Stanford staff and then a few
              years later moved out into the community with Meg Marnell and Rochelle Kramer
              directing the treatment program.</p>
                  <p>In 1982, the clinic became The Palo Alto Shyness Clinic, under the direction of Dr.
              Lynne Henderson. Dr. Carlo Piccione, a licensed clinician, also assisted with
              intensive individual treatment and worked with out-of-town clients who were seen for
              up to 6 hours a day over a long weekend of in vivo treatment. In 1982 ABC 20/20 TV did
              a fine program on "The Pain of Shyness" that featured Zimbardo's research and the work
              of the clinic. In 1994, the clinic moved to Portola Valley, and became simply The
              Shyness Clinic. Since then, the clinic has moved to Menlo Park. Dr. Henderson
              continues as its current director, and guides both treatment of individual and group
              therapy as well as the logistics of its operation. Henderson and Zimbardo recently
              added a Shyness Institute which they co-direct, to promote shyness research, and
              training of therapists interested in some of the pair's successful approaches to the
              treatment of shyness in adults and adolescents.</p>

               <p>This series documents the planning, execution, and aftermath of the Stanford Prison
            Experiment (SPE) project. Included are audiovisual materials including audiorecordings
            and videorecordings from the experiment, as well as post-experiment audiorecordings and
            videorecordings which consist of interviews, discussions, presentations, and
            documentaries about the project. Administrative records relate to the SPE and include
            project planning documents, prisoner and guard files, arrest cards, correspondence with
            participants, questionnaires, and all other textual documents related to the SPE.
            Objects and ephemera include posters, prisoner gown, and prompter scripts for
            documentary <title render="italic">Quiet Rage, the Stanford Prison Experiment</title>.
            This series also contains photographic slides of the SPE.</p>
               <p>Note: there is some overlap between this series and the Audiovisual materials series,
            where there are also audiovisual materials related to the Stanford Prison
            Experiment.</p>

                           <p>Documentary made from original film footage of the Stanford Prison Experiment.
                    Includes flashbacks, post-experiment interviews with the prisoners and guards,
                    follow-ups, and a commentary by Professor Zimbardo and others involved in the
                    experiment that helps put what happened in perspective. The documentary also
                    includes a remarkable exchange filmed after the experiment between "John Wayne"
                    and one of the prisoners he tormented.</p>

                              <p>The original Betacam SP master tape was digitized on an Apple G4 Laptop using
                      Final Cut Pro 3 software.</p>
                              <p>The resulting file was an 11.23 gigabyte, uncompressed DV stream.</p>
                              <p>Minor editing (removing opening and ending black) was done in Final Cut Pro 3
                      (Mac-only software) and chapter markers were inserted at appropriate places.
                      The file was rendered into an .m2v file (video) and an .aiff file (audio) for
                      the DVD.</p>
                              <p>The .m2v and .aiff files were imported into DVD Studio Pro 2 (Mac-only
                      software) as a track.</p>
                              <p>Photoshop 7 (Windows version) was used to create an opening menu and chapter
                      menu that were saved as .psd files (Photoshop native format). These files were
                      at a size of 720 x 534 pixels and a resolution of 72 dpi (standard for
                      NTSC/DVD Video). The fonts were Chiller, Times New Roman, and JS_Stencil
                      Lithuanian.</p>
                              <p>Artwork was created to be printed onto the surface of the DVD and artwork for
                      a cover to be inserted into black plastic DVD cases. For the words “Quiet
                      Rage” a font called Chiller was used, and for “The Stanford Prison Experiment”
                      a font called JS_Stencil_Lithuanian (Times New Roman was used elsewhere). The
                      Chiller and Stencil font files are included on this CD, as are the Photoshop
                      artwork files in .psd format at a resolution of 600 dpi.</p>
                              <p>Note: This CD also contains two Photoshop files that were not ultimately used
                      but may be useful in the future: dvd_cover_jewel.psd (artwork sized for a
                      jewel case instead of a large black plastic DVD case), and
                      dvd_label_large_hole.psd (for DVD brands that have a large, unprintable hole
                      in the center).</p>
                              <p>The 70 original still images to be used in the slide show also had to be
                      prepared for the DVD. Any image that will be seen on a TV set must be resized
                      to reflect the “non-square” pixels on a television. This is why the DVD menus
                      were made at 720 x 534 instead of 720 x 480 (the standard size of captured
                      video). For the still images, this meant resizing the vertical dimension so
                      that it was 89.99% of the original. This was accomplished with a script in
                      Photoshop.</p>
                              <p>In addition, an opening informational image was created in Photoshop to be
                      the first slide in the slide show (00-opening.jpg). The resized images,
                      opening image, and DVD menus were then imported into the DVD Studio Pro
                      project.</p>
                              <p>The stills and new opening image were arranged using the DVD Studio Pro
                      slideshow feature. The first image was a given a duration of 8 seconds, and
                      all others were given a display time of 5 seconds.</p>
                              <p>The DVD's main menu was created with buttons linking to the start of the film
                      track ("Play Film"), a secondary chapter menu ("Chapter Selection"), and the
                      slide show ("Slide Show"). This was a layered menu with button effects made by
                      associating Photoshop layers with appropriate button states (“up,”
                      “highlighted,” and “activated”).</p>
                              <p>The chapter menu was also created as a layered menu, and buttons were added
                      that pointed to each of the chapter markers and also a link back to the main
                      menu.</p>
                              <p>The DVD was then “built” in DVD Studio Pro. This process involved
                      multiplexing the video and audio streams and integrating them with the slide
                      show and menus to create two folders (Video_TS and Audio_TS). The Audio_TS
                      folder is empty but necessary for certain older DVD players. The Video_TS
                      folder contains one or more .VOB files (Video OBject) and tiny .IFO and .BUP
                      (InFOrmation and BackUP) files that interact with DVD Players and tell them
                      how to play the DVD.</p>
                              <p>The Video_TS and Audio_TS were burned onto a blank DVD and tested in various
                      computers and DVD Players. </p>
                              <p>Once the DVD was finalized, the files were transferred to a Windows machine
                      that was connected to a DVD duplicator and printer: Primera’s “Composer Pro”
                      (duplicator) and “Signature IV” (printer).</p>
                              <p>4x (speed) inkjet-printable DVD-R’s from a company known as Ritek/Arita
                      (sometimes Ridata) were used.</p>
                              <p>To print on the DVD using the .psd (Photoshop) file, we had to “print to
                      file” first to create a .prn file that the Signature IV printer could
                      understand. The .prn file was then opened in Primera’s software in order to
                      print directly onto the DVDs.</p>
                              <p>The DVD burning and printing was a slow process, even at the 4x speed.
                      Although the Composer Pro duplicator has two DVD drives, its software advised
                      us not to use them both at once. This meant our production time averaged 5 or
                      6 DVD’s per hour with intermittent verification (DVD checking).</p>
                              <p> ARCHIVE FILES</p>
                              <p>There are three DVDs that contain the uncompressed video stream. These files
                      can be brought into Final Cut Pro or another video editing program and
                      rejoined without losing any of the original content. They are:</p>

                      3_part_quiet_rage.dv 00:36:09;17 - 00:51:41;25</p>
                              <p>There is one DVD that contains the DVD Studio Pro project and all of the
                      “assets” (video stream, audio stream, slide show images, and menu files).
                      Because of the way DVD Studio Pro works, it will be necessary to re-link these
                      assets if the project is opened on a different computer. It would be advisable
                      to copy the information from the DVD onto the computer’s hard drive before
                      attempting to re-link and edit the project.</p>
