            <p>Five framed items were labelled and shelved with the picture collection in the Department of Special Collections:</p>

               <item>Photograph or Painting of Jane L. Stanford</item>
               <item>Photograph or Painting of George Crothers</item>

               <item>Letter from Herbert Hoover, copies of which can be found in the Crothers Papers (in "Related correspondence," filed under "Hoover")</item>
            </list>
            <p>These five items were removed in 1962 at the time the collection was first arranged.</p>
            <p>In May 1966 Ralph Hansen removed all the Trustee Minutes from the collection (formerly in boxes 17 and 18). These Minutes were added to the group of Trustee Minutes in the University Archives (#1011). Rather than renumber the rest of the boxes in the collection, a note simply was made that Boxes 17 and 18 no longer existed. (For an exact list of the Minutes transferred, see the original 1962 Register filed in the "Crothers" correspondence file in the general files of University Archives.)</p>
