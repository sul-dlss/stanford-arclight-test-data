         <p>Professor Girshick was born in Russia on July 25, 1908. He came to New York City at the
            age of 15 in 1923. The principal of the elementary school he attended in New York was
            Angelo Patri who took a strong interest in the boy and, after he graduated from high
            school in 1929, intervened personally to get him admitted to Columbia College. In 1934,
            he entered graduate school at Columbia University to work with Professor Harold
            Hotelling, who arranged a stipend from a Carnegie Foundation grant.</p>
         <p>He left Columbia in June 1937 to begin a very distinguished career in government
            service. For the next ten years he held positions in several government or
            government-sponsored agencies including the Bureau of Home Economics and the Bureau of
            Agricultural Economics in the Department of Agriculture, the Statistical Research Group
            at Columbia University, the Bureau of the Census, and the Rand Corporation in Santa
            Monica. He joined the faculty at Stanford University as Professor of Statistics in 1948.
            He was a member of several professional societies and was president of the Institute of
            Mathematical Statistics.</p>
         <p>Professor Girshick has made a lasting mark on several different branches of mathematical
            statistics. His contributions in all the fields in which he has worked have already
            shown their enduring value. His work has been marked by continuous attention to
            applications, as well as the fundamental theory, and evinces the beneficial
            cross-fertilization of the two.</p>
         <p>His earliest work was in the field of multivariate statistical analysis, where he made
            important contributions to the sampling theory of the roots of the determinantal
            equations. While at the Department of Agriculture he applied his work to a study of body
            measurements of American boys and girls.</p>
         <p>As a result of his participation in the Statistical Research Group, he became greatly
            interested in the sequential analysis of statistical data then being developed by
            Abraham Wald and others. He made a number of important specific applications of the
            method, and contributed a fundamental innovation in determining the operating
            characteristics of sequential sampling plans. Alone, and in collaboration with others,
            he studied some of the estimation and probability problems arising as a by-product of
            sequential analysis. His interest in sequential analysis merged into a broader interest
            in statistical decision theory, which relates to the foundation of statistical inference
            both in the non-sequential and the sequential cases. This work, in collaboration with
            others, restated many classical statistical procedures from a more fundamental point of
            view, and culminated in the studies of the invariance properties of statistical tests,
            which have yet to be published. Much of his work was embodied in the book "Theory of
            Games and Statistical Decisions" which he wrote in collaboration with David
            Blackwell.</p>
         <p>An example of what may represent Professor Girshick's outstanding characteristic was his
            ability to make himself the center of a beehive of activity. Whenever a colleague or
            student thought of some promising idea, he would automatically go to Professor Girshick
            who would rapidly digest the idea and extend it in unexpected directions. One could
            always count on his interest and advice in the work one was doing. These qualities made
            the Department of Statistics a working group whose interrelated activities led to
            increased accomplishments and satisfaction for all. There is very little that has been
            produced by the Statistics Department which does not represent his ideas or his spirit.
            His warm, enthusiastic interest in scholarly work led many workers in different fields
            to seek him out as a collaborator.</p>
