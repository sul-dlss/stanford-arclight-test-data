         <p>The materials consist of of printed ephemera from President Benjamin Harrison's epic cross-country railroad journey, from the papers of E.F. Tibbott, Harrison's private secretary who accompanied him on the trip. The President's train left Washington and proceeded to make a large loop through the country, traveling through nineteen states - Virginia, Tennesee, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The journey covered nearly 10,000 miles, during which time the President made nearly 150 speeches, which were later published in a volume compiled by a correspondent from the New York MAIL AND EXPRESS (item no. 23) who accompanied the President's party. The introduction to that volume claims, "So complete were the arrangements in detail that the train carrying the Presidential party was always on time, and was never once delayed for repairs. Country of all sorts was traversed, all kinds and conditions of mankind seen, and every variety of weather encountered. Still nothing hindered the party from keeping every engagement."</p>
         <p>The majority of the items in this archive relate to Harrison's time in the West, particularly California.
