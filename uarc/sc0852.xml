         <abstract label="Summary:">Papers include correspondence, articles, news clippings, and several photographs. Rice's letters to Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1941, include reminiscences of many alumni and of events during his student years, suggestions on what Stanford needs to be doing, and reminiscences from his life on a variety of topics. His letters to Wilbur, 1942, which he sometimes labels "Conditions in Wartime Washington" are very detailed about street life in Washington (D.C.), bureaucracy in government offices, his housing, cost of food, rent, crimes in the city and his suggestions on curbing it, number of women in the city, church attendance, and many other topics. Other correspondence includes letters from William H. Reeves (class of 1895), 1949-50, which talk about his life with some Stanford reminiscences; correspondence with Stanford librarian Ruth Scibird, 1950-51; and one letter from J. E. Wallace Sterling, 1949. Rice's articles on Stanford's history include "World's Historic Stanford Shoe," sketch of and notes about horseshoe worn by Leland Stanford's horse Arion when he broke a trotting record; "They All Slept Here," memoirs about Encina Hall written in 1953; "Fifty Years of It," his notes on Stanford history compiled for it's 50th anniversary; and 49 pages of notes written after a 2-day alumni conference in Dec. 1921 (10 of which recount a tour of the campus). Collection also includes brochures and newspaper articles by Rice, 1912-39.</abstract>
