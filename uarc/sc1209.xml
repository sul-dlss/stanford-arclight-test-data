                  <p>Bartz, Carol, president and CEO of Autodesk, Inc., argues that entrepreneurship is
              more important in large companies. The companies that survive do so because they know
              how to innovate, take risks, and reward risk-taking organizational behavior and
              structure.</p>

                  <p>Bartz talks about a slogan inside Autodesk called fail fast forward to counter a fear
              of failure within an established organization. Their goal was to have employees
              understand that failure is very acceptable within an established organization--the key
              is to identify it quickly, and move forward with lessons learned. This is an attempt
              to break free from those who are worried about risk-taking.</p>

                  <p>How do you seek out and promote quality leaders from within a company? Leaders are
              often self-selected from peers, Bartz says. On way to identify them is to set up a
              management meeting and tap into the different groups across the company and note who
              gets picked to represent the individual groups. Usually, these are your leaders.
              Because they are easy to work with and are creative, they are sought out as leaders at
              whatever level they are in. No one wants to work with an asshole, however qualified
              they may be.</p>

              entrepreneurship bug early in life when he heard about Intel starting up. He was

              great role model, he says.</p>

              Stanford University. He describes why persistence and evangelism are important.
              Although he was not admitted to Stanford at first, saught more real-world experience,
              and was not admitted again, through persuasion and persistence, he was finally
              accepted.</p>

                  <p>Launching a start-up is not a rational act. And Khosla, Vinod, a partner in Kleiner,
              Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers and former Sun Microsystems CEO, believes that success
              only comes from those who are foolish enough to think unreasonably. Entrepreneurs need

              extraordinary. </p>

                  <p>Entrepreneurs are far less successful when they are trying to make money--they are
              much more successful when they have a mission to change the world. No matter what you
              do, Khosla says, you have to be foolish to do what an entrepreneur attempts. Whatever
              your value proposition is, it should have the goal of making the world a better place
              and you should feel passionately about your contribution. If you don't have this and
              you run into an obstacle, you get stuck. If you are passionate about your product and
              your message, you can power through problems more easily.</p>

              environments to be an investor. The last three or four years were not a lot of fun--if
              Khosla went to someone to build a reasonable business, the response he would get was
              that another company was willing to give more money for less work. He would have to

                  <p>Khosla explains how to think big and act small. He reminds us that part of that
              process must be done on a belief system. Without a mission or belief system about how
              to change the world, one will not be successful.</p>

                  <p>In Kleiner Perkins perspective, Khosla argues, the traditional model of giving is
              broken. Social entrepreneurship and ways to leverage money are very important.
              Although there is not enough money in the world to solve the world's problems, if you
              apply and multiply, there are, in fact, solutions to some of these problems. Examples
              of companies providing these solutions include Gramine Bank and Aprotech.</p>

                  <p>Khosla talks about how Juniper Networks started, and the role of customer feedback in

              for the internet. Juniper perservered and took a risk in the technology, despite the
              majority of customer feedback.</p>

                  <p>It is important to use time to get deep expertise, Khosla notes. You need to go much
              deeper in understanding technology--a bachelor's degree is not enough and will be
              irrelevant in another 10 years. If you have a goal of entrepreneurship in mind, you
              must go deep in an expertise in order to advance your career.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins, Jeff, co-founder of Handspring, has never thought of himself as an
              entrepreneur.Being an entrepreneur is not a career choice, he says, but is something
              you do at certain points in your life because you have to. Hawkins believes
              entrepreneurship is a means to an end, as opposed to an end in itself.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins talks about his life, his education and work experience. He started his
              career at Intel for 3 years and then moved to a start-up that he did not start. While
              working at the latter he created his first product - first pen-based computer. He soon
              realised that all personal computing ought to be smaller and simpler. With this
              thought he started on the path to try and accelerate this shift - and that was the
              genesis of Palm computing.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins shares the various reasons why he and his team finally spun off from 3Com to
              start Handspring. Although they were reluctant to leave and start a company from
              scratch, they felt that Palm did not belong in 3Com- a networking company. Palm was
              the only healthy division in 3Com and they could not continue growing and competing
              with a financial hand tied behind their backs.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins is working on his third start-up. Besides starting Palm and Handspring,
              Hawkins also followed his passion for theoretical neuroscience, the study of how
              certain parts of the brain work from an information theory point of view. He started a
              non-profit research institute called the Redwood NeuroScience Institute. Through this
              experience, he learned that starting a non-profit is just like starting a
              business.</p>

                  <p>It helps to have experience under your belt before you start your own business, says
              Hawkins. You ought to have experience working for a good management team and give
              yourself time to have great mentors. You also have to learn to manage growth and
              success and how to deal with and anticipate bad times. In Hawkin's experience, the
              vast majority of people that start companies and do so successfully have had past
              experiences that helped them.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins, Jeff encourages students to do something they believe in. Business is hard
              and every company will have its trouble, the only way one gets through these times is
              if they you a cause and you believe in it. This passion gives momentum to see the bad
              times through. In his experience, people who started a company for the sake of
              starting a company failed when the hard times came upon them. At Palm the passion was
              the product, selling the company was not in contradiction with this passion, but
              allowed people at Palm to continue making good products. He says that it doesn't
              matter that the money isn't rolling in, but that we are all excited about what we are
              doing, and we think its great! This excitement carries companies and people
              through!</p>

                  <p>Hawkins stresses that one must separate oneself from work. You are not your company,
              he says, you are not your product. Your company may fail, your product may fail, but

              their kids. What people remember is if they changed the world, if they had a good time
              in the process, or if they promoted a positive culture. He talks about balance in

                  <p>Hawkins believes you have to be conscious and methodological about your company
              culture. The culture starts at the top and permeates to the bottom. The culture at
              palm is a product culture. High integrity is not just internal, but integrity with
              vendors, suppliers and customers. A lot of companies keep secrets, but the
              transparency has been very good for Palm, Hawkins points out. A good, solid culture
              can help a company go through hard times.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins talks about the complicated negotiations with 3COM for the spin off of Palm.
              Discussions lasted five months and involved investment bankers and board members. Five
              different proposals were presented to the CEO, including spinning off Palm two years
              in the future. However, the final decision involved no doors banging, and no storming
              out of offices. All said and done, Hawkins, Jeff did not want to start a company.</p>

                  <p>When starting a business one tends not to focus on employee issues. Hawkins stesses
              the importance of laying a strong foundation of human resources from the very
              beginning. He shares ideas that he feels make sound human resource policies. When you
              are thinking of compensation between people, he says, you should always imagine that
              everyone knows everything.</p>

                  <p>I never had a technology company, says Hawkins. He believes that products come out of
              product marketing people who really love and understand products. He asks his
              employees to use competitor products to learn something from them. The focus should be
              on what people want and what they need, rather than only on technology.To build a
              successful product one has to innovate continuously, focusing on what people do and
              not what they say. And if you build a product, use the thing yourself.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins talks on the importance and inevitability of portablity. With portability
              comes small size, low cost, simplicity and the need for less power. With wireless
              networks on their way to becoming very inexpensive, Hawkins envisions a T1 line with
              high horse power and large memory in the pocket! The need for portability will make
              the item in your pocket the center of your universe, he says. He notes that there will
              be obstacles, but believes that this shift is inevitable.</p>

              some traction.</p>

                  <p>Roizen notes some of the opportunities available for up-and-coming entrepreneurs: 1)
              There is still a tremendous amount of capital. Mobius, in 2002, had $500 M - $8 M left
              to invest in one fund, 2) There is rationality for the market with respect to hiring,
              office space and expectations of people to work with, 3) Company valuations are still
              pretty high, 4) Collaborative efforts between entrepreneurs and VCs, and VCs with
              other VCs, are strong5) Working with a VC is the one time in your life you have
              someone working for you and paying you at the same time.</p>

                  <p>Roizen talks about what she would look for in a VC. From her perspective, acquiring a
              VC is the only time you're getting someone to work for you and pay you at the same
              time. She recommends people populate their investor pool with VCs who will add value
              to their company.</p>

                  <p>Previously, Roizen says it used to take three years for startups to reach liquidity;
              now the time frame is five to seven years. As a result, she recommends startups get to
              know the VC well and trust them because they will be working with the VC for many
              years. Now as an entrepreneur, she says, you have to work for a living!</p>

                  <p>It is important that the startup team have experience - a combination of grey hair
              and youth is good, says Roizen. VC's have learned that it is not wise to fund a team
              with only college students, but older people cannot get funding without youth. VC's
              are looking for a technology to exploit with a team of individuals comprised of young
              and experienced members.</p>

                  <p>Roizen talks about the importance of bootstrapping and maintaining control of the
              company in the early stages. Not only do entrepreneurs have to work for a living, they
              also have to make the money raised last for a longer time. When capital became easily
              available, Roizen notes that people stop making money the old fashion way: by working.
              If you make profit, you don't need other people to invest in your company, she
              says.</p>

                  <p>Roizen believes startups should have venture capital, but at the right time and used
              judiciously. She talks about the Barbell syndrome, where startups raise money for the
              first and last rounds, but not the rounds in between. It is very difficult to raise
              these middle rounds, which allow startups to treat money better.</p>

                  <p>Roizen thinks that one of the biggest mistakes companies made in their hayday was
              considering VC money as their own. Entrepreneurs forgot they had to pay back their
              investments. If there is any value that gets created as a result of the entrepreneurs
              sweat and VC money, she says, then the VC's get the money back first.</p>

                  <p>Roizen believes terms are more important than a startup's valuation. One of the
              biggest mistakes entrepreneurs can make is to sell part of the company, think they've
              made a few million dollars, and then forget to factor in the investment from VCs, she
              says.</p>

                  <p>Timing is everything when starting a company, Roizen says. Mobius raised their money
              in a good time and now have a lot of gas in the tank, she notes. Some companies needed
              money in June 2001 when people were not answering phone calls. She considers this an
              example of bad timing.</p>

                  <p>Roizen talks about her experience in taking venture capital. She learned that if one
              can use venture funds judiciously to raise the inflection point, then it makes sense
              to do it. For her, it was an economic decision. Other reasons to take VC money involve
              credibility issues. Customers want to see that you have partners and money in the bank
              to prove that you will be around, she says.</p>

              they have four fulltime recruiters to find the right people for all their companies.
              VCs also call the issues, and thus play a very critical role.</p>

                  <p>Roizen believes that in the VC business, most companies fail. Therefore, the rare
              successes of their portfolio companies has to be big. Often you hear 10X, i.e. you
              should see 10 times your capital coming back, she says. It is also calculated as
              dollars in, dollars out, or internaI rate of return (IRR). The Mobius fund today has
              an IRR of 90%. Roizen notes you will almost never hear a VC use IRR.</p>

              next step. The day you come in for an hour-long meeting, she says, plan on a 20 min.
              presentation (no more); get to the value proposition in 5 minutes; be articulate;
              manage the meeting; show experience and establish credibility.</p>

                  <p>Early investors in Global Fund for Women were Bill Hewlett, David Packard, Esther and
              Walter Hewlett, says Ramdas. These were people who understood that you could take a
              risk on a small organization getting started in a kitchen, the Global Fund for Women,
              she explains.</p>

                  <p>One of the premises of the way the Global Fund for Women thought about distributing
              capital to social entrepreneurs was that there already existed a network of people who
              knew where critical things were happening on the ground, says Ramdas.</p>

                  <p>Ramdas reveals that she was attracted to the work of the Global Fund because women
              were doing things to both change their own circumstances, and also to transform what
              existed in their own communities. She was amazed that there was an organization that
              was willing to put the resources directly into the hands of women.</p>

                  <p>The Global Fund for Women was not started by wealthy women. It was started by three

              could promote social change by investing in women. It does not require a lot of money

              found that women in their respective countries are extremely good judges of what
              issues are most important, what risks are involved, and the best ways to address these
              problems without creating direct confrontation or conflict. They often fund groups of
              women, rather than individuals. Women's issues that are the most controversial around
              the world include: lesbian rights, reproductive health, abortion rights.</p>

                  <p>Ramdas's father was in the military, and her mother was a social activist. The family
              was a middle-class Indian family, yet privileged to be in such a position. As a result
              of her upbringing, Ramdas has a combination of seeking structure/order and an urge to
              constantly question authority. The family moved often, and she developed a strong
              sense of what it meant to be a global citizen.</p>

                  <p>Kavita Ramdas, President and CEO of The Global Fund for Women (GFW) understands the
              importance of sustainability for its grantees because it must also be a sustainable
              organization. GFW helps grantees by discussing up front ways for strengthening and
              expanding funding in communities. She stresses that sustainability is not to be
              confused with creating a profit-making venture. GFW also perceives that funding should
              continue over longer periods of time and groups should be encouraged to diversify
              funding base, build more capacity, engage with others in the community.</p>

                  <p>The Global Fund for Women believes there is room for a different kind of philanthropy
              to exist in other parts of the world. In most parts, there is a huge division between
              those who have and those who do not have. Those with wealth do not tend to see
              investment in development as part of their responsibility. Ramdas notes that this is
              thinking that must change.</p>

                  <p>Global Fund for Women CEO Kavita Ramdas talks about financial contributions for the
              greater good both ly and internationally - and that here in the US we give a very
              small percentage of our income to remedy the world's concerns. Ramdas cites the gap
              that exists between how much people think our government should be giving to global
              relief - 15-20 percent of our national income - but that less than 1% actually makes
              its way outside the United States.</p>

                  <p>How do philanthropies measure success? The Global Fund for Women makes general
              support grants, not project support grants. This is a huge issue in philanthropy,
              because general support grants are much harder to measure.</p>

                  <p>The Global Fund for Women (GFW) is overwhelmed with requests for grants-3,000 every
              year, in many languages, says Ramdas. International advisors give feedback on
              priorities for social areas in their communities. GFW also have a basic set of
              criteria -- is it a group of women instead of an individual, do they have a clear
              articulation of how they will challenge women's positions within that society? GFW
              doesn't give a grant until they have an endorsement from the ground, she says.</p>

              uses Google as an example of a company that has changed the world and has evangelists
              supporting their cause and spreading the word.</p>

                  <p>Kawasaki shares his thoughts on whether or not to get an MBA. The problem with an MBA
              he says is that you believe you are being taught how to manage, and he generally
              thinks it is impossible to learn how to manage in school. The only way to learn how to
              manage, according to him, is to do it in the real-world.</p>

                  <p>What is the difference between a brilliant idea that is successful and a brilliant
              idea that is not successful? Kawasaki believes that luck, timing and karma are the
              keys to success. Karma has to do with whether your product will ultimately make the
              world a better place, and he believes that the best technologies really do
              survive.</p>

                  <p>Kawasaki thinks that companies like Nordstrom, Audi, and Nike make the world a better

              should study and do what you love, he says. He can't promise you that the money will
              come, he does promise that if you start a company simply for the money, you will
              probably end up miserable.</p>

                  <p>JetBlue uses technology to become more efficient, to lower costs, says Neeleman.
              Today at JetBlue, we book 71% of our bookings over the internet, he says. We can't
              ever forget that there is a human aspect to our business, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman talks about how JetBlue has been able to succeed in a really bad industry.
              The airline industry has lost more money than it has ever made. In the beginning of
              human transportation, be it steam ship lines or railroads, there are very few
              companies who have survived. It has never been good business to move people. It was
              with that backdrop that Neeleman decided that he wanted to start an airline.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman tells the story of his first startup failure during college, and the airline
              partner he was working went out of business. He shortly thereafter received a call
              from June Morris, who encouraged him to come and build Morris Air. Morris Air grew and
              prospered, and was sold to Southwest for 130 $M, with Neeleman as the second largest
              shareholder at the time.</p>

              model of bringing humanity back to air travel, and making a difference, he adds.

              care about my shareholders, I only worry about my employees." In 32 years, Southwest
              has never laid off an employee. Neither has JetBlue, which has only been around for
              several years, but has experienced September 11th and a war. We have learned that it
              is all about taking care of our people, he says.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman points out that JetBlue pays employees more than standard wages at United
              Airlines. They use technology to be more efficient, to spend less money in other
              areas. Much of the pay that employees receive is incentives. For example, pilots and
              flight attendants who fly over 70 hours each month receive time and 1/2. About 20% of
              compensation last year was based on the success of the company. In the 2nd full year
              of operation, over $17 M was given back to employees, which is 15 1/2%. We have an
              ability to give people an upside in the company based on their performance, he
              says.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman talks about how JetBlue has to continually take the temperature of the
              company and its employees. We have to model the values that we want to see in our
              employees, and make sure they feel they are being respected, he says. To monitor
              performance, JetBlue gives surveys for employees. Preliminary results show 72% of
              employees completed the survey. We scored just below world-class scores, and will now
              review all the feedback and make action plans for improvement, he says.</p>

                  <p>In 2002, we received negative feedback from employees regarding the leadership within
              the company, says Neeleman. We realized that there was not a leadership training
              program--we weren't training the managers to be the conduit for the company culture as
              we brought on new people, so we implemented a leadership program with 5 principles of
              leadership, he says.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman talks about how Sam Walton, founder of Walm-Mart, figured out that knowledge
              in distribution, price points, and that little human touch would revolutionize retail.
              He also mentions Dell Computer as another example--computers are a really bad industry
              right now, but Dell manages to offer low prices, and offers great customer service and
              personalization. Nucor steel has been successful in the steel industry. JetBlue
              appears to model the successes of these companies, he says.</p>

                  <p>Neeleman believes the success of JetBlue to this point is the company's price points.
              I pray for the day our competitors can match our fares, he says. Currently,
              competitors are desperate to gain back market share and have been undercutting prices.
              The success of JetBlue is because of loyal customers. We have somehow been able to
              levitate above a commodity business, as Dell or WalMart have done well during bad
              industries, he adds.</p>

              was completely implemented and managed online--we don't send anything out via mail.
              JetBlue has 10 or 15 people available via telephone to deal with problems, and 700,000
              members online. Neeleman on things JetBlue should improve: checking people in using

                  <p>We spent 4.5 years defining the customer experience, and we tried to put our money
              into things that mattered to people. Food is one example: I have never heard a single
              soul say that they haven't had a good meal, and so they'll book an airline ticket.
              This year, we'll serve 10 million customers. If we'd spent $5 on a meal for each
              customer, we'd have spent $50 million of food that wasn't appreciated. So we use humor
              to inform people that there won't be full meals, and we provide snacks at 17 cents
              apiece. We knew that televisions would be memorable. I remember one of the happiest
              days when we were starting JetBlue was when we found the companie who installs direct
              TVs in planes. I wanted to give people control on an airplane. The cost of
              implementing the televisions was a fraction of the cost of serving full meals.
              Cleaning the airline was another example. And helping customers put bags away, to
              improve the gateway time.</p>

              is when people--employees and customers--come up to me and thank me for starting

                  <p>Reedy talks about the importance of rapid execution with integrity and confidence:
              executing with a vengeance. Another important principle, she says, is to keep the
              community front and center in the decision making. The founder understood the power of
              the community and till this day the community is at the center of everything that eBay
              does, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Reedy talks about the importance of being flexible. In a high growth company, like
              eBay, opportunities arise everyday and if a company is not flexible it will miss these
              opportunities, she says. Similarly, as issues arise, eBay is flexible and willing to
              tackle these issues, she adds.</p>

              company is. The business has two levers: the website, which is the product, and the
              product enhancements that eBay does as well as the marketing. The engineering group is
              pragmatic and focuses on value. Time to market is very important. The technology is
              made for the business and for the future, she says,and is flexible and continuously
              improves.</p>

              was given only three days to launch The Auction for America, which required 20 hours
              alone for coding and additional time for testing. One hundred people worked on this
              over the weekend and they had the product one hour before the deadline. No one said we
              can't do this, she says. The teams had to collaborate and work together to get this
              done.</p>

                  <p>Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, had a sense of community, says Tilenius. He
              constructed a process of feedback to make it easier for two strangers to buy and sell.
              Having been an entrepreneur before eBay, Omidyar was thinking creatively about how to
              get profitability. The feedback system was his way of getting out of the middle. At
              every stage he found ways of letting the community run itself so that the company
              could become profitable from the beginning.</p>

              in Japan with 500,000 listings. This made it difficult for eBay and they made the
              decision to exit. We believe that you have to be number one in the market or it isn't
              worth investing in, she says.</p>

                  <p>Reedy talks about how eBay views PayPal. PayPal is a payment platform while eBay is
              the auction platform and hence the two coexist very well. Tilenius talks about the
              integration of PayPal into eBay. They plan to keep it as a separate platform because
              the vision is to have PayPal the payment platform for the entire web. In the long term
              they will try to integrate what they have at eBay and PayPal to create an end to end
              e-commerce solution.</p>

                  <p>eBay is in 28 countries and the company is looking into cost effective ways to enter
              new markets, says Reedy. PayPal will attack Europe next year. Typically, eBay, being
              global, can enter new countries easily; in the case of PayPal it will take more
              effort. When making an acquisition eBay lets the business strategy define the process
              or platform. Over time they look for ways to move the country onto the platform as
              long as it does not put the country or the business model at risk.</p>

                  <p>Reedy explains how a company goes from 3 billion to 30 billion. eBay has less that 1%
              of the retail market in most cases. Management believes that eBay should do more of
              the stuff that they are already doing. eBay will expand to new countries and work at
              categories like business and industrial. The company plans to achieve this goals of 30
              billion using its platform and by learning from the buyers and sellers, she adds.</p>

                  <p>An important area for improvement is cross-border trade, which includes shipping,

              continue to grow the trading community (e.g. Auction Drop) is also important. Some of
              the key questions the company attempts to answer are: How do we convince people of the
              safety of the site, and how do we make it easier to use?</p>

                  <p>eBay has about 5000 pages that must be ized, says Tilenius. Hence, eBay plans to
              reduce pages, keeping the important functionality and making it easier to go from

              similarities than differences. Thus, eBay only has to be customized in a few areas,

                  <p>Slow down in capital spending has had a profound effect on the enterprise software
              companies, says Thompson. Symantec has made tremendous investments to retool
              infrastructure of the company in the last 2 years to scale the business. This story is
              being replayed time and time again in the valley, he says. With capital spending
              decreasing, companies are adopting new models - software as a service. There is no
              right answer and model; it is a function of the nature of the business you are in, he
              notes.</p>

                  <p>Thompson stresses the need for customer diversity. Software companies that were
              dependent on Fortune 1000 companies for their business suffered when their niche
              clients also suffered in the economic downturn. If a company is to survive challenging
              economic times, companies must have a diverse customer base, he says. Symantec brings
              stability to its business by serving individual customers as well as the largest
              governments and corporations. It brings essential geographic diversity by deriving 51%
              of its business from outside the US.</p>

                  <p>John Thompson states a company must never stop spending on innovation, even in
              challenging times. When Symantec's customers had no way to measure the effectiveness
              of the security technology they deployed, the company chose, amidst a difficult
              period, to spend a large percentage of revenue to build a portfolio of tools that
              would become industry standards.</p>

                  <p>Intrusion detection is the next big opportunity, says Thompson. However, it is 10%
              the size of the antivirus market, and is therefore relatively small. First generation
              intrusion detection technology was very difficult to deploy and manage he notes. Now
              these customers, especially those in the financial space, want intrusion prevention
              technology. Migration from software to hardware is first driven by desire to improve
              line speed. Thompson talks about ways in which many companies are adopting this model.
              Symantec chose an alternate model because it is primarily a software company.</p>

                  <p>John Thompson talks about the key driver at Symantec - product focus.To meet this
              goal, the enterprise was forced to make difficult decisions, including purging
              products that were not core to their network-centric vision. The result was that
              hiring and partner relationships, among other things, became much more
              streamlined.</p>

                  <p>Amateur hackers are mainly knowledgeable about the windows environment, says
              Thompson. But professional hackers can hack into anything. Symantec welcomes the
              giants like Intel and Microsoft into the space. According to Thompson, the Netscape
              phenomenon was a product of the arrogance of youth that is not prevalent in the
              country boys at Symantec.</p>

                  <p>Going back to 1998, Symantec was best known for Norton utilities and Norton
              anti-virus, says Thompson. When he arrived in 1999, right after windows 1998 was
              launched. Symantec had had a bad series of quarter. In his first 100 days, he looked
              at the company product portfolio and found products that were not of strategic value.
              The brightest star was Norton anti-virus. Symantec had viewed itself as a consumer
              oriented desktop software company. Coming from IBM, Thompson decided that Symantec
              would be an enterprise security company. He went about acquiring technologies around
              the security theme. Symantec used these acquisitions to retool the company. However,
              the market was not mixed enough and they couldn't get the enterprise multiple. At this
              point, Symantec decided to do a billion dollar transaction that became the catalyst
              for changing all the business processes. It finally moved to being an enterprise
              focused security company.</p>

                  <p>On Network Association as competition, Thompson thinks that the final chapter on both
              the companies is not written. However, he does believe that execution at Symantec is
              better and the customer base is more diverse. While Network Association was capturing
              the enterprise market, Symantec were concentrating on diversifying their customers.
              Now Symantec is doing better in the enterprise and consumer space. That said, Thompson
              stresses that one can never count a company out.</p>

                  <p>Thompson says that is possible to include transaction-based security products, but it
              is not probable because this would mean working in the domain of the big giants like
              MS .NET, Sun, Cisco etc. Part of the problem is that security has been an
              after-thought. In the future, they will become more a part of application design. Many
              web server based and platform based companies will have to integrate that more tightly
              into their solution set. Thompson would rather focus on infrastructure and let them
              focus on transaction.</p>

              knows what is being measured and managed and how they should behave in the contest. He
              stresses that in today's environment, it is not about managing results but about
              leading teams across a company. Managing implies you know what the outcome is that you
              want, and leading implies that you are going to inspire people to do things that they
              didn't think they could do, he says. In conclusion, Thompson reiterates that a company
              should measure what matters and reward people handsomely for the results.</p>

              happen. They don't just sit around talking, they go out there are make it happen.3)
              They have unjustifiable optimism. They believe they can succeed in the face of

                  <p>Kaplan talks about companies having personalities that reflect the personalities of
              the founders. If you know Bill Gates, you know Microsoft, he says. Entrepreneurs
              should think about what personality they want the company to have and what personality
              they themselves have as the founder.</p>

                  <p>Sales skills and very important and can mean many different things depending on what
              you are selling, says Kaplan. However, an entrepreneur doesn't necessarily need to
              have these skills, they should be able to attract people with these skills. The
              important skill for an entrepreneur is to know what you are good at and what you are
              not good at, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Kaplan says that every idea is repeatedly proposed. Timing of an idea is very
              important and very difficult to call. This involves enabling technologies, customers
              and trends in the investment industry to come together. He gives examples from TiVo
              and Amazon. An idea does not stand alone independent of timing and the investment
              industry, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Kaplan talks about the different kinds of risks (market, financial and technical)
              that an entrepreneur faces when starting a company. The trick is to get the risk out
              as soon as possible. If your product is not obvious to the market you must go out into
              the market and explain it to them, he says. He shares the example of TiVo.</p>

                  <p>Kaplan is working on some really "wacky" things. According to him, the next big wave
              is going to be in Microsensor technology. This will enable people to use technology to
              do things that don't seem possible. He designed and built a home automation system
              which narrates whatever is happening. He has basically integrated information from
              multiple sensors.</p>

                  <p>Kaplan talks about how roles change within a company when a transition from R&amp;D
              happens. A vice president of sales when you are trying to get 3 test customers is not
              a good executive if you are planning to expand to different regions and have a large
              sales force, he says. You must keep in mind that when transitioning and scaling up,
              you might have to change management and get in the heavy hitters with experience, he
              adds.</p>

                  <p>Elon Musk, co-founder, CEO, and chairman of PayPal, shares his background: He was
              accepted into Stanford but deferred his admission to start an internet company in
              1995. His company was zip2 which helped the media industry convert their content to
              electronic medium. Then, he sold the company for over $300 million and never came back
              to Stanford.</p>

                  <p>After his company zip2, Musk started exploring other opportunities on the web. He
              realized that money required low bandwidth and there was not enough innovation in the

              acts as a sales person by sending money to a friend and hence recruiting another
              customer. By the end of the second year, PayPal had a million customers with no sales
              force and no advertising budget, he says.</p>

                  <p>Musk talks about the problems with space exploration in the US in the 22nd century.
              The long term plans are to have something cheaper and safer. In Russia, it is safer
              and cheaper and they have a better track record. They are constrained however by the
              weakness of the Russian economy. China is expected to launch their first person into
              space this month, becoming the third country to put a person into the orbit. They have
              great ambitions and are planning to set up a space station on Mars and eventually
              sending humans to Mars. In the US, once enterprises enter this space with an
              entrepreneurial spirit, Musk hopes to see the same growth seen in the internet. Musk
              talks about efforts that are already in the pipe line.</p>

                  <p>Musk talks about the common themes between zip2 and PayPal. Both companies had
              software and internet technology at the heart, were in Palo Alto, CA, took similar
              approach to growing (building small talented teams), and had a typical silicon valley
              flat structure. These companies did not worry too much about IP and paperwork - they
              were focused on building a great product. Often it is better to pick a path and do it
              than to vacillate on which path to follow, Musk notes.</p>

                  <p>According to Musk, some causes of the high costs in space exploration are: The energy
              to launch a rocket into space is very high, all the calculations have to be right and
              this is very expensive given the low launch rate. His final analysis is that rockets
              should be a lot cheaper and presently there are a lot of inefficiencies.</p>

                  <p>Musk talks about how SpaceX is reducing the cost of launch vehicles. The focus is on
              every element of the vehicle and this has involved hundreds of small innovations as
              well as reducing overheads. In the case of PayPal, there were back office
              relationships that had to be established but everything was done in parallel, thus
              saving time.</p>

                  <p>Musk talks about how there's no one area where costs were reduced in space travel,
              rather it was every decision across the board. The focus was on simplicity--and
              simplicity reduces costs. For example, fewer components means fewer components to
              repair, and to purchase, as well as to test. The avionics vehicles communicate via
              ethernet--while not novel, it is unheard of, compared to other systems that use
              cables, he says. In addition, overhead at a 30 person company is much cheaper than at
              Lockheed or Boeing, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Ringold talks about the fundamental differences between sole entrepreneurship in the
              academic setting versus entrepreneurship in an industry setting: a change in dynamics
              from a sole activity, to teamwork from different disciplines to solve fundamental
              problems. Industry has learned this long before the academic environment - that you
              need to bring people together from various industries and disciplines, with different
              skill sets to solve fundamental problems, he says. It is rare that a fundamental
              problem, which leads to an applied product can be solved by a team of engineers only.
              It is the intersection of disciplines that leads to innovation and discovery - teams
              need to be built of different disciplines and skill sets in order to be most
              effective, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Ringold talks about the decision to move away from being a technology based company
              at Affymax to applying the technology to pharma because of the relatively small life
              of a leading technology. Because of lack on internal infrastructure, they decided to
              sell the company and put it into the hands of a bigger company that had the
              infrastructure and expertise to use the technology. After a global search, Glaxo
              bought Affymax, he says.</p>

                  <p>Ringold talks about how the pharmaceutical industry is built on failure and
              inefficiency and has a small success rate. This recognition led to Surromed. The low
              success rate is driving the consolidation of companies, which is giving rise to mega
              players. Now a blockbuster product has to be a multibillion product. This can only
              change with a change in the processes it uses. New biotech companies are starving for
              funding and cash, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Ringold thinks that biotech companies are fighting the consequences of what to place
              in the bubble of dotcoms. The bubble was not based on reality. Now it is hard for good
              companies to get funding, he says.</p>

                  <p>Ringold partnered Alex Zaffaroni, a pioneer in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
              industry, to help start biotech companies. The upshot was, they started Maxygen, run

              one purpose being applied to a whole host of other problems, says Ringold.</p>

              diagnostics 2) Right medicine for the right patient in the right dose at the right

              a report by McKinsey which summarizes the status of drug discovery.</p>

              cholesterol are among the leading pharmaceutical products today--and these are not

                  <p>Surromed has had to adapt its business plan, downsize the company, and pair down
              numbers of diseases, says Ringold. Things are very different from when they started
              the company. To be stronger when markets open up and to start a company today, one
              must build slowly and be flexible, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Ringold talks about how patents are critical in different ways in different stages of
              a company. Patents in the early stage are very important to get a competitive edge.
              Ultimately, patents that are most valuable are those on composition and matter, he

                  <p>Surromed had to change their business plan due to two reasons, says Ringold: 1)
              External climate 2) Lack of potential partner interest. All good startups will adapt
              the business plan in their life, he notes. For example, Surromed shifted to a product
              revenue generating model. They started to provide a service to make money which they
              could invest in their own discoveries. The company moved from generating equity
              capital to generating revenue.</p>

              cycles. There are many different kinds of cycles, such as economic and technology
              cycles, she notes. Silicon Valley, in the last decade, seems to have forgotten about
              cycles. We began to believe that everything was up, and nothing would come down, she
              adds.</p>

                  <p>Estrin declares that technology cycles have to start with a break-through innovation,
              something significantly disruptive. When it happens we don't know it is a
              break-through technology, she notes. In time, however, applications are built around
              this technology, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Estrin talks about the three parts of the IT cycle, particulary the enterprise
              productivity cycle. Enterprises have changed the way they did business. They use the
              internet to communicate with others, bringing IT to small and medium businesses.
              Enabling technologies have fueled this cycle, which is in its maturation phase, where
              IT is in minimal demand and there is over capacity.</p>

                  <p>Estrin talks about the personal connectivity cycle. The cycle of connecting people is
              the notion of people being able to connect to each other and connect to information
              anywhere. This means true mobility and ubiquitous, high bandwidth connectivity, she
              says. The enablers of this cycle are economic and behavioral. From an IT demand
              perspective, she explains, the real win is in the consumer devices and services and
              not in the IT infrastructure. Related issues are business models (walled garden, AOL
              vs. seamless systems, Internet), affordable broadband to the home, and making
              technology easier to use. The consumer market is not an easy market for a startup to
              begin with and to innovate in, she notes.</p>

                  <p>Estrin talks about how the last cycle is about connecting embedded devices, as
              opposed to connecting computers. The real win in this is when we can build a
              completely new architecture for networks that are self-configuring, she says.
              Interesting work in academia is targeting this area. She talks about technology
              enablers in this cycle and the focus on low power, and not performance.</p>

              bringing researchers and developers together under the notion that they would work on
              5-6 projects and either spin out or license technologies. This model was successful
              for 3 years, but after that more money was needed as there was no licensing
              business.</p>

                  <p>Start ups are difficult and risky, says Estrin. Lots of combined skills are
              necessary. Attention to details, hard work and a lot of luck play an important role in
              the success of a company, she says. The environment is risk averse today--customers,
              funders and employees. Start ups have to be creative and find alternative funding, she
              adds.</p>

                  <p>Estrin explains how it is difficult to reach critical mass in a tough economic
              environment, which prevents startups from growing enough to compete. She gives a
              personal example of Precept attempting to enter the market, but not reaching critical
              mass by the time Microsoft entered the market as well.</p>

                  <p>The consumer market is not a very friendly market for startups, says Estrin. It can
              be a 5-7 year deal and not a 2-year cycle. It is a long haul to liquidity, she notes,
              but the good news is that rent is cheaper. It is important to build a strong
              foundation a brick at a time.</p>

              listening to customers, employees and the market. Beware the fine line, she warns.</p>

              afford 2) It takes a lot of alliances to be successful and this is hard for a startup

                  <p>Yock talks about the Biotech bay - the other Silicon Valley, and how the products
              offered are based on the science of genetics. Medtech focuses on instruments,
              equipments, and is not a trivial market sector, he says. The Bay has titans like
              J&amp;J, Guidant, and Boston scientific, for example. There is significant start up
              funding into the Medtech sector. Half to two thirds of venture funding for Medtech
              goes into Northern California, he adds.</p>

                  <p>John Simpson, a Stanford trainee in cardiology, thought the catheter system didn't
              work so he worked in his kitchen in Menlo Park to develop a catheter that is easier to
              use. He used a guidewire to travel down into the coronary artery . With money from
              Fogarty and Ray Williams, an angel investor, he started a company called ACS, which
              grew into Guidant.</p>

                  <p>When Yock started getting involved in training, he worked with John Simpson and the
              mentoring changed his life. One thing that was starting to become clear in mid 80's
              was that there was a problem with angioplasty - arteries were narrowing at an alarming
              rate. Hence surgical procedure had a 40% recurrence rate. Yock started to focus on the
              need to visualize during a surgery and hence the need to get inside the blood vessel.
              With Simpson, Williams and Fogarty, Paul started a company with technology that went
              inside the artery and saw in high resolution. He talks further about this
              technology.</p>

                  <p>Yock talks about how over the years the technology improved and the problem of
              re-narrowing of blood vessels could be addressed. He shares the reasons of this
              re-narrowing - the blood vessels shrink. He further discusses the solution that he and
              other doctors have employed.</p>

              idea behind the Clark Center is to put something physically at the interface between
              school of engineering, school of medicine and H&amp;S and draw people in to start
              interdisciplinary collaboration between the sciences. The new department of
              Bio-engineering, under both school of engineering and medicine, will be housed here.
              Yock also talks about the BioX program at Stanford.</p>

              in medtech, you have to keep it simple. The reason is that people in MedTech seem to
              have less skill, and even less patience than a typical kid in an 8th grade shop
              class.</p>

                  <p>Yock talks about a group of people called interventionists who train in catheter
              techniques. This requires a different set of skills. One of the trends recently is for

                  <p>Yock talks about the costs versus the charges of medical stents. A cynical approach
              is that the actual metal stents themselves cost 80-90 cents to make and their charge
              is about $1200. However, there is an enormous amount of R&amp;D effort to get it
              approved, he says. For example, a clinical trial can cost as much as 10 millon
              dollars.</p>

                  <p>Yock addresses the question: Where else is convergence happening between biology and
              devices? He believes that outside of the cardiovascular area, convergence is happening
              in drug deliveries for many uses. The combination of sensing some condition and
              delivering and optimizing drugs is something that will be seen in the future, he
              says.</p>

                  <p>Kim Smith, co-founder and CEO of NewSchools Venture Fund, is a leader in a hybrid
              environment between business people and educators, who speak different languages and
              come from different frameworks. A hybrid in this context includes the public sector,
              non-public sector and business sector. It is difficult to manage a group that comes
              from such diverse backgrounds, says Smith. A lot of technology companies have to deal
              with the same sort of dynamic between technologists and business people.</p>

              venture. Entrepreneurship is about solving a problem in a better way and finding a way
              to make it happen, despite everyone telling you it cannot be done, she says. People
              did not believe Teach for America would work, but Smith and founder Kopp, Wendy
              realized people weren't becoming teachers because they weren't being recruited and the
              process to get certified was too bureaucratic. They created a model in Teach for
              America that solved these problems, and were successful, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Smith explains that a theory of change in the social sector is roughly equivalent to
              a combination of the business model and strategy in the for-profit world. You need to
              identify a change and have a hypothesis about how to make it happen, she says. This is
              more complex in the social sector because, in additional to market forces, you have to
              deal with regulatory forces, emotional forces, social forces, and political forces,
              she adds. A set of core beliefs are usually taken for granted in the business world,
              but in the social sector they need to be established. She believes the core beliefs
              are the basis of the theory of change and help you decide what to do--otherwise you
              could end up trying to change too much. Though there is always a need elsewhere, a
              social venture can only take on what falls into its focused mission.</p>

                  <p>Smith talks about how focus is crucial for entrepreneurial leadership. It is
              impossible to do everything so the core beliefs of the venture provide the necessary
              direction. It is sometimes hard to turn down a project that will help the people you
              are trying to serve, but a good leader knows what he is able to take on and what he
              must leave for someone else, she explains. It is important to recognize that change in
              education is not as easy as moving a policy lever, and therefore entrepreneurs are
              critical for spurring the desired change.</p>

                  <p>There is a current shift in K-12 education from a culture of compliance, says Smith.
              Compliance is not a high enough standard and should not be accepted. Unfortunately,
              the culture shift to a new standard is uncomfortable since the old system is so
              engrained.</p>

                  <p>Smith explains that venture philanthropy means investing in ventures that lead to
              greater changes in the overall system to improve education for kids. The entrepreneur
              is a part of a much larger system and the aim is to leverage the investments to
              provide the greatest possible impact. This strategy has led to three key activities at
              New Schools: the creation of a network to generate more hybrid leaders and inform
              policy makers, a charter accelerator fund to create charter schools, and a performance
              accelerator fund to help schools become performance-oriented.</p>

                  <p>New School Ventures is a non-profit public charity with the sole purpose of creating
              better opportunities for children who are not currently being served by public
              education, says Smith. They are unique in that they feel it is important to be able to
              invest in both for-profit and non-profit entrepreneurs, depending on the situation.
              Any returns are folded back into the fund and reused.</p>

                  <p>In five years, New Schools has given 10,000 kids access to new schools, says Smith.
              Public charter schools provide an alternative to government-run schools by giving the
              school much more flexibility while maintaining accountability. She believes this
              flexibility encourages innovation and increased performance. Other portfolio items
              include: 1) Teachscape - an online teacher-training program, which uses a video case
              method of instruction 2) Successforall - a non-profit literacy program spun out of
              John Hopkins 3) Carnegie Learning - a for-profit literacy program competitor.</p>

              size of the education industry, investments must be leveraged to get maximum effect.
              New School's helps to leverage their investments by bringing together a partner group
              that includes venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and educators, who each bring
              different strengths and views to the venture.</p>

                  <p>John Kennedy said that there is risk and cost to a program of action, but it is far
              less than the long-range risks and costs that come from comfortable inaction, says
              Smith. Though it may seem scary to make changes and safe to do nothing, it is not
              true. A leader's job is to be passionate, figure out what needs to be done, and then
              be willing to take the necessary risks to make it happen, she notes.</p>

                  <p>School finance is inequitable between low- and high-income communities, says Smith.
              Is it better to try to fix the system or provide alternatives? New Schools funds
              projects for both options. Most reform efforts to date have focused on only small
              improvements inside the system. Though most people think of charter schools as
              competition, says Smith, New Schools describes them as 'co-opitition,' providing an
              alternative but also helping to encourage improvement in public schools.</p>

                  <p>Smith explains that fundraising is very hard in the non-profit sector. New Ventures
              typically co-invests in A rounds with other venture capital firms, typically newer
              groups that have an openness to thinking about new solutions and understand the power
              of entrepreneurs. Generally, deals are in multi-millions with clearly defined
              milestones over several years.</p>

                  <p>Scale is very difficult in the non-profit sector, says Smith. The franchise model is

                  <p>Smith talks about how the VC model allows for larger investments over a longer period
              of time. Also, the investment tends to be in organizational infrastructure rather than
              a service. VCs are more focused on growth than bottom-line success, she says. An
              entrepreneur must be disciplined and willing to walk away from people who do not share
              the same values.</p>

                  <p>Smith explains that New Ventures measures success in four layers. The first layer of
              success is immediate outcomes for the kids served by current ventures. The second
              layer is the ventures' impact on the system. The third layer is the success of New
              Schools in assisting their ventures. The last layer is the change in the entire system
              to a performance-based model with greater hybrid thinking.</p>

                  <p>Smith believes that extracurricular activities are essential. Funds are being cut
              currently because, in trying to achieve funding equity, everyone's funding was reduced
              instead of simply increasing funding to those who needed it. Fixing this is a matter
              of political will, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Companies today need to be nimble and adaptable to the changing environment and
              market around them. Being nimble is important. The second skill is to think through
              when you're going to ship your product. If you think about the innovation; is it a 2x
              improvement, is it a 10x improvement? Think about what the market will be when you
              ship your product. If you have a four-year development cycle, youwill have a physical
              product that's going to be a very different world you're entering in than if you enter
              in today. Being open to learning about interdisciplinary things involves a willingness
              to ask dumb questions. And, finally, it's important to realize that the longevity of
              companies is shorter today than ever before. Eventually all companies die. Just give
              it a billion years; you think long enough it's going to happen, even the Microsoft.
              And the question is just where on that spectrum you are - how do you think about
              organizational form, federation of people, and the business structure? Most of all,
              companies must embrace change, plan for change, and view it as an opportunity.</p>

              entrepreneurs. When DFJ evaluates an opportunity, they look at whether it extends

              narrows the rich/poor gap, he says.</p>

              recent investments were $100,000, $550,000 and $1,000,000. The average for DFJ is $2-3
              million in the first round of investment and the high end for is $4-5 million, with a
              possibility of $6 million for a later stage company, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Jurvetson describes his position and interest in the nanotechnology industry. In his
              opinion, it is still too early for the average venture firm to invest in the
              industry--in part, because they invest in companies that are much farther along on the
              risk spectrum. However, individual partners or firms that do early-stage investing are
              interested and the numbers are growing. Draper Fisher Jurvetson is one of them, and
              likes to be early in any new wave. In addition, the government funding for the sector
              is going up immensely, $3 billion internationally next year, and most of it is outside
              the US. The number of companies in nanotechnology are going up dramatically, so there
              is a lot of activity, he says.</p>

              team and space. But even with all of that, Netek couldn't get off the ground, he

                  <p>Number 5 in Levinson, Frank's Top 10 Things You Must Have to Start a Business. When
              starting a business, says Levinson, it becomes your life. Having a family that
              supports you and understands that they may not see you often is a great benefit. He
              talks about his family and the way they adapted.</p>

                  <p>It's often more difficult than it sounds, but it's important to be fanatically
              ethical when building a company, says Levinson. He believes people understand if it's
              an ethical environment right away. It is something that people gravitate to, he says,
              so you just have to build it early and never step off of it.</p>

                  <p>A familiar question among potential founders, says Levinson, is how much business and
              operational experience do I need to have before starting this business? He talks about
              the best experience a founder can have - the kind learned only by jumping in with both
              feet and learning as you go.</p>

              high-tech industry, it's fast-paced and often cutthroat. Keeping ahead of the

              your team small and focused.</p>

                  <p>Inevitably, when a company goes public, there's an enormous amount of change that
              takes place, says Levinson. While the IPO may be an indication of financial success,
              the true measure is within the company, and maintaining a level of normalcy and
              maintaing the company's original culture, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Kelley, David, founder and CEO of IDEO Product Development, grew up in Ohio, where he
              survived on a diet of Velveeta cheese and white bread, He attended Carnegie Mellon and
              studied electrical engineering, but spent more time working on carnival floats. After
              graduation, he worked for Boeing on the 747. He learned early that in a large company,
              he didn't get to choose the people he worked with. He came to the Graduate Product
              Design Program at Stanford, where he discovered his passion--design. His first company
              was called the Intergalactic Destruction Company. One of the things he learned in
              graduate school was that you can use design in any situation in life.</p>

                  <p>Kelley explains that he has a unique perspective on starting companies--his goal is
              not growth, but to create a personal gratification system. A place where he can work
              with friends. He explaines that many of his comments on starting a company may not
              apply to companies that are trying to grow as fast as possible.</p>

                  <p>Kelley describes three important steps in starting a company: 1) Follow your passion
              2) Hire great people 3) Focus on process. His passion is design, but there must be a
              balance between passion and business issues. People often worry too much about the
              financial side of the company and fail on the emotional side of the company, he
              says.</p>

              design as a process of having a combination of ideas in the head that need to be
              organized, while making a leap of faith about how it will be presented. It is a
              totally enjoyable experience, he says, there's a zen moment where time goes by and you
              lose track of everything. He presents a few design projects, including personal Sky,
              SpyFish and weather-related inventions.</p>

                  <p>IDEO Founder Kelley, David suggests avoiding conventional approaches to hiring
              employees and building teams. In this clip, Kelley offers a few suggestions: 1) Hire
              individuals or non-confomists to stimulate the organization, 2) Hire a diverse range
              of experts and generalists from different fields, and 3) Form "hot groups" of 8-12
              people for maximum impact. Kelley also encourages building close ties to universities
              to source potential staff. To Kelley, an ideal hire interacts well with established
              staff and demonstrates an "attitude of wisdom" that strikes a balance between the
              ability to promote ideas and the ability to consider feedback.</p>

                  <p>Kelley believes that you need a language, a process and a framework in order to
              design. He stresses that experience is key success factor: learn from all the projects
              you've worked on, distil the knowledge and apply it to your future projects. He
              recommends reading The Art of Innovation for IDEO's concept of a great process.</p>

                  <p>Kelley talks about how the observation phase is the most overlooked part of the
              development process. Kelley hires social scientists to watch people complete tasks
              instead of asking them usability questions. He prefers to see them as customers
              instead of users and strongly believes that customer satisfaction comes with
              understanding their values. He gives examples of how his team will observe a customer
              in their usual environment instead of inviting them into a sterile lab for product
              testing. The case studies he presents include a television remote control.</p>

                  <p>Kelley believes you start to think about things completely different when you think
              your job is to design the experience of using the device as opposed to designing the
              device itself. Kelley feels that to captivate an audience you need to build a context
              around the technology you are marketing and take into consideration how outside
              factors will affect how your product is perceived. He uses methods of transportation
              as an example</p>

                  <p>Kelley believes that how quickly you create an initial prototype is directly
              proportional to how successful a product will be. Essentially, given a set project
              deadline, the earlier you invite feedback, the more chances you have to revise and
              improve. He calls this "enlightened trial and error."</p>

              up with the promise of cash is a customer of IDEO. He recounts a previous client

                  <p>Earl, Nick, General Manager of Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio, talks about how
              the General Manager's job is to run one of EA's six studios, which are the places
              where they actually build the product. The GM administers and manages the portfolio of
              products at the site. Each product is then run by an executive producer. The executive
              producers are entrepreneurs in their own right and the products are managed almost
              like independent ventures.</p>

                  <p>Earl talks about how the majority of the products at EA are sequels that are released
              every year. The main decision for EA on these projects is budgeting how many people to
              work on each every year, he says. Occasionally, there is a new product idea. This idea
              must pass a lot of market opportunity analysis before it is launched because it is
              very expensive and risky to build a new product. Still, new products are seen as a
              critical part of the future of the company, he adds.</p>

              entrepreneur is someone who sees an opportunity that other people cannot see, tries to

              risk, and relentlessly and persistently pursues success. Specifically in the game
              industry, however, the objective for the entrepreneur is to deliver fun, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Kim explains that EA's strategy is based on nailing down the "X," or organic fun
              concept for that product. EA shares knowledge across studios and around development
              creating a collaborative environment. The development process is pretty standard:
              build prototypes, do market tests, start to build it and, ultimately, finalize the
              product, she says.</p>

              companies, and some are the result of partnerships.</p>

              worldwide. The mission with the GameBoy is to create some unique draw or additional

                  <p>There were a number of creative imperatives that were addressed in the development of
              James Bond, says Turner, primarily, retaining authenticity to the Bond character. Bond
              has an aura of always being in control of his environment, and this had to be
              maintained in the game. At a practical level, this required integrating combat and
              stealth in moment-to-moment game play. This was achieved by combining the best
              features of two competitive products, she adds.</p>

              to be a customer. In order to create a good product, she notes, the team was using the
              product everyday. The last lesson is to know when to add more features and when to cut
              and ship the product.</p>

              an undergraduate, started working in management consulting, and then decided to start
              a web-design company. Afterward she acquired an MBA and joined a startup company.
              Later on, she joined EA online in an entry-level position.</p>

                  <p>Kim's first game experience was a hugely successful online parlor game that was
              launched on AOL. Majestic, her second game, tried to stretch the Internet experience
              into the next generation of games, but didn't do as well, she says. The core team from
              Majestic was out of work and looking for another project, and stumbled into the Lord
              of the Rings.</p>

                  <p>Kim talks about how in November 2001, the value proposition for Lord of the Rings was
              mixed. There was no movie yet and movie producer Peter Jackson had a questionable
              record. There was a lot of uncertainty over the successful prospect of the movies.
              However, the core team took an entrepreneurial attitude and decided to see what they
              could make of the opportunity.</p>

                  <p>he goal from the outset with Return of the King, says Kim, was to turn it into a
              perennial business. The "X" for Two Towers was "play the movie," but Return of the
              King was "live the movie." The development was brought in-house. Fan feedback was
              incorporated. The game was done in 16 languages for X-Box, Playstation2, GameBoy
              Advance, Nintendo GameCube, and the PC.</p>

                  <p>Kim talks about lessons learned in game development. The first lesson is to focus.
              You can't build a game unless you know what it is, she says. The second lesson is that
              with an enormous team, team culture is an issue. EA solved this by dividing the teams
              into smaller pods with their own leadership, she notes. The pod leaders would all
              coordinate on reaching milestones.</p>

                  <p>Earl and Kim respond to the question: How has the competition from Grand Theft Auto
              influenced EA? Vice City is brilliant in its open world design, says Earl, you can go
              in any direction and interact with the environment. Grand Theft Auto was a little bit
              of a wake up call for EA suggesting that they should be doing something like it and
              watching out for the competition, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Earl and Kim respond to the question: How do you increase innovation when a lot of
              the game development relies on established brands and sequels? A lot of efforts are
              going onto create new intellectual property, says Earl. Though risky, the new products
              will ultimately be the core component of the company's future.</p>

                  <p>Earl talks about how EA is good at figuring out early on if a game is not going to be
              successful and starting over before it is too late. EA brings a compliment of
              distribution, marketing, resources, larger teams, better technology, and high caliber
              designers, artists, and engineers to help increase the chances of creating a
              successful game, he says.</p>

                  <p>Earl explains that EA was previously focused mainly on sports games, but they found
              that they could not grow fast enough without expanding into other areas, namely
              entertainment. Games are continually becoming more mainstream and a lot of people can
              relate to movies making them a popular choice a game topic, he says. EA is now divided
              into three brands, EA Big (sports), EA Games, and EA Online.</p>

                  <p>Winblad, Ann of Hummer Winblad Ventures argues that there has been a steady dealflow
              in venture capital from 2002-2004. The software sector is still the big leader, though
              biotech is catching up. Though she doesn't discuss outsourcing, Winblad emphasizes
              that a company must consider where they can get the best intellectual capital. Today,
              company strategy starts globally. She also discusses trends in the software market,
              including open source material, Moore's Law (storage is free) and Metcalf's Law, and
              mergers and acquisitions.</p>

                  <p>Winblad explains that very few Series A investments were done in 2002. However, a lot
              more were done in 2003 and will be done in 2004, she says. The reasons for the decline
              since 2000 include: restart dollars were competing with the A round dollars; corporate
              investors disappeared (excpet Intel); and individual investing declined. Additionally,
              during this era, VCs were doing deals individually, creating twice as many A round
              deals and putting only one person on the board. Now, A round deals are syndicated to
              provide more coaching, she adds.</p>

                  <p>According to Winblad, the intellectual capital in your company and the coaching it
              gets is more important than money. There is a high bar for hiring employees. Most
              companies die of self-inflicted wounds rather than from competition or lack of
              opportunity, she says.</p>

                  <p>Winblad, Ann advises entrepreneurs to boil down their business plan and tell everyone
              in the company the top five assumptions for success. "As time goes on, turn the
              assumptions into facts," says Winblad. She also reminds entrepreneurs to constantly
              reevaluate these assumptions as their company moves forward. </p>

                  <p>Winblad talks about how whole projects are not outsourced. The core technology is
              separated and written, while incremental pieces that would be done linearly are
              outsourced abroad. There are a lot of talented architects and developers around the
              world, she notes, but they do not have the vision to be inventors.</p>

                  <p>Winblad talks about how VCs spend a lot of time with the leaders of major technology
              companies to find out what they are looking for. It is important to talk to consumers
              early rather than late, she notes. Today's leaders are technologically-savvy, know
              what they need, and are willing to tell you if you ask, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Winblad explains that companies use both a .net and a Java standard and neither has
              taken over. Most likely, neither will. Customers like to have a blend of technologies
              and programmers like to be looking at the new latest thing so there is currently no
              force to change to a single standard.</p>

                  <p>Winblad believes IBM has done an extraordinary job at establishing itself as a leader
              in software. IBM is proactive with acquiring early stage companies and partners well.
              Microsoft is successful because they view everything as a threat and don't take
              anything for granted, she says. Linux is still a force and will not easily go away
              because it is really hard to kill large companies in the software industry.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum has been an entrepreneur her whole life, starting her first company at the
              age of 3. She spent her early career years working at companies she was not passionate
              about and these experiences taught her that she could sell anything to anyone. When
              she decided to work on something that really inspired her, she discovered that a great
              group of advisors was an indispensable resource.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum sold her first major company, Skyline Toys, when the company was at a
              critical juncture: they either need to find a strategic partner or raise a lot of
              money. A perfect partner was found in IDEO, and she sold the company. Mandelbaum
              decided to take her career in a new direction because she was intrigued by the
              opportunities of the internet and was interested in joining a venture firm.</p>

                  <p>When deciding what companies to invest in, Mandelbaum spends a lot of time with the
              prospective company. She considers what skills the founders have and what positions
              they could fill in the company through time. She wants only the companies that have
              great aspirations, not just the ones that want to be good. Finally, she considers the
              IPO scenarios available to the company.</p>

                  <p>A common problem Mandelbaum sees in new companies is an unwillingness of the founder
              to let go. The mark of a great entrepreneur is the ability to recognize what skills
              you have and what tasks would better be left up to someone else, she says. Choosing
              the best people and board members is essential to the future of the company.</p>

              entrepreneur is to surround oneself with great people and ask these people lots of
              questions. Take the opportunity to meet with as many people as possible because they
              could potentially become a best friend, she suggests.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum did not consciously make the decision to shift her life's work, but was
              asked by two friends to help them with their new venture firm. This was in 2002, and a
              very difficult time to start this type of company. She got very involved in the
              challenges of the project and decided to commit herself to what Monitor Ventures was
              trying to do.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum believes that the best, and arguably most valuable, part of business
              school is the people you meet. She recommends working before going into business
              school to provide some experience that can be shared among classmates. Though the
              business school material can be learned just about anywhere, the experience, because
              of the networking possibilities, is invaluable, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum moved into the outdoor toy market because she loves sports and outdoor
              games. She is thriving at Monitor because they focus on companies that have developed
              innovative applications for technologies that exist, rather than brave new world
              startups.</p>

                  <p>The paradox in starting a company is trying to get funding without any team while
              trying to get a team without any funding, says Mandelbaum. She also emphasizes that
              the solution to the paradox is to find a way just get to that next step, where there
              will be different opportunities and different risks.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum answers the questions: How much of my business idea should I reveal to
              investors? She believes that if you have a great team and a developed idea, it is fine
              to talk about the idea with investors. If you never talk about it, it will never get
              anywhere, she adds.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum believes that one is born an entrepreneur. A person can learn the basics
              of entrepreneurship, but the willingness and eagerness to take risks should come
              naturally and cannot be taught. A great entrepreneur is someone who keeps the team
              going through the bad times when the future looks dim, she notes.</p>

                  <p>Even without money for salaries, people are often attracted to companies with equity,
              says Mandelbaum. Obviously, equity is more attractive for people early on in their
              careers without a family to support and mortgage payments to make, she adds. However,
              there is angel money available right now from people looking for great ideas, so
              equity doesn't have to be the only compensation option.</p>

                  <p>Mandelbaum recommends trying to meet someone that has connections in the venture
              capital community. It is very difficult to approach a venture firm unsolicited, but
              much easier with the introduction of an influential person in the community. Take
              advantage of opportunities to get in touch with venture capitalists, she suggests.</p>

              Though the men went in separate directions after college, the bond that had formed
              between them remained. When one of them approached the two others with a business
              proposition about ten years later based on his research at Caltech, they joined him,
              and Fluidigm was formed.</p>

              Fluidigm, around 1999, was not favorable towards anything without dotcom in the title,
              and their funding requests were met with hundreds of no's. However, as the technology
              continued to develop, it became clear that they were on to something big; a small,
              simple rubber valve that was like an integrated circuit for biology, he says.</p>

                  <p>Fluidigm started the wrong way, notes Worthington. Instead of discovering a market
              opportunity and then finding the technology and team to take advantage of it, they
              invented the technology first, realized its potential, and then searched for an
              application for it. Worthington suggests that most technology companies, in fact, work
              the latter way.</p>

                  <p>Worthington talks about how the founders understood that the key to creating a
              successful company was picking only the very best people at every level of the
              company, especially the VCs and Board of Directors. Gajus sacrificed time (it took a
              year and a half to recruit some board members) and money (settling for a lower
              valuation from a better VC) to assemble the right team.</p>

              and calls upon them to do things that people do not normally have to do. They way to
              get through these challenges is not by talent, but by obsession and determination, he
              says. Without these qualities, he would not recommend starting a company.</p>

              hoped and soon they had a product with many important features, including an immediate
              economic benefit to the customers, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Though Fluidigm is essentially a tool company, which is not very glamorous, says
              Worthington, they were successful in raising funding because they were a real,
              functioning company that already had customers and were able to prove a real market.
              Worthington recommends not wasting time with venture capitalists that are not
              immediately enthusiastic about the company. Once they make up their mind against the
              company, there is no use pursuing it. On the other hand, when there is that mutual
              connection, pursue the VC relentlessly.</p>

              talent: breakthrough technology and chemistry. Obviously, the technology was a big
              draw for many people to come to Fluidigm, he says. Chemistry was not as obvious an
              asset. Worthington got along well and developed strong relationships with many
              individuals that helped Fluidigm to recruit the top talent.</p>

                  <p>Worthington would not trade his technical degree for an MBA. He sees entrepreneurship
              being about breaking many of the rules that one learns in business school. He sees
              being able to lead as much more important to having an MBA, and suggests practical
              experience as a better alternative.</p>

                  <p>The applications for the Fluidigm technology may be far from being realized, says
              Worthington. Fluidigm is currently working on high-throughout methodologies, like
              genome screening and protein-protein interactions, as well as what could turn out to
              be breakthrough science: using rubber pumps to simulate body functions to trick cells
              into thinking they are inside the body, he says.</p>

                  <p>The financial hardships Fluidigm encountered after September 11 were the most
              difficult stage for the company, says Worthington. The company needed financing
              quickly or it would disappear - a time that was incredibly physically and emotionally
              draining for him. Fortunately, the tough times were more than balanced by a number of
              fantastic highs, including the first major reorder, the first shipping of a complete
              system and the first success report from a customer, he notes.</p>

                  <p>When in search for a market, Worthington advises not to focus the company too early.
              Though there is tremendous pressure in the beginning to focus, this is dangerous; once
              a company has defined a focus the decision is very hard to undo. Worthington suggests
              waiting it out and seeing how the product develops before focusing.</p>

                  <p>There are no plans at this time to make the rubber chips reusable, says Worthington.
              Because the chips are so cheap to produce, Fluidigm would have to charge an enormous
              amount for them in order to make a viable business model where the customers are
              reusing the product, he adds. There is also the practical consideration of using
              pristine materials in experiments to ensure against contamination, he notes.</p>

              Worthington, they initially were almost incapable at making decisions and constantly
              argued. Worthington decided that the only solution was to set up a decision making
              process. He set a timeline for the decision, organized the staff into teams, and gave
              them specific instructions to evaluate the options. Each team performed wonderfully
              and the process even spurred invention, he notes.</p>

                  <p>Early in his career, Gordon was influenced by some of Silicon Valley's great
              founders. He started out as a mechanical engineering student at Stanford and developed
              a strong relationship with a professor who challenged his assumptions and forced him
              to not be satisfied with an incomplete answer.</p>

                  <p>Gordon caught the startup bug while working for Measurex, but wondered if there was a
              way he could work for multiple startups at a time, as an advisor for many companies
              rather than as an executive at just one. He attended law school and Apple was one of
              his first clients. He deeply regrets not accepting Steve Job's request to pay the $500
              legal fees in stock instead of cash!</p>

                  <p>Gordon describes the idea of bullet train thinking. You assume you want a train that
              can travel at ten times the speed of a conventional train and then figure out what
              would have to be possible in order to make it work. With this assumed result, you must
              think of creative solutions that otherwise would not likely be considered. In a
              startup, when you only have two months left of money, you find a solution in those two
              months because it is the only option.</p>

              Apple has tremendous creativity that has paid off with the success of the iPod. Oracle
              is extremely dedicated to its vision and has surmounted obstacles in order to achieve
              it. Intuit has a relentless commitment to the customer that has led the company

                  <p>Scott Cook and Tom Proulx of Intuit approached Gordon for advice on what venture
              capital to accept. Gordon recommended they accept the funding based on the two lowest
              valuations for the company because the offers came from Doerr, John and Burt McMurty,
              two of the best venture capitalists in the business. Even at the lower valuation,
              Gordon predicted that the leadership from these two men would more than make up for
              the lost profits in the long run.</p>

                  <p>Google has decided to IPO though the Dutch auction method, which has never been done
              for such a large-scale offering. In the Dutch auction method, each buyer makes a blind
              bid for what they are willing to pay. The seller then finds a clearing price for how
              many shares they want to sell, and the people with bids above that price are awarded
              stock. The method is designed to avoid the tremendous first day stock price volatility
              experienced by newly-public companies.</p>

                  <p>A number of great companies including Oracle, Apple and Google were started by
              first-time entrepreneurs. Even with great mentoring, how were they so successful
              without experience? Gordon answers that first-time entrepreneurs are the ones with the
              passion and drive to build a great company.</p>

                  <p>Outsourcing is a common trend in the market right now and has been a topic at every
              board meeting. The economics for outsourcing are compelling, but it is hard to know
              what the intellectual property protections are like. Though copyright and patent
              protection exists in theory, it is still difficult to ensure protection overseas.</p>

                  <p>The way in which stock options are valued is going to change. Though many companies
              have generous stock options, they also pay generous salaries because Silicon Valley is
              an expensive place to live and engineers need cash. Therefore, there is not a big
              differential between the salary with stock options and the salary without stock
              options. The size of stock options is likely to decrease, which means a reduced
              ownership of the company by employees and therefore a lowered incentive for creativity
              and innovation.</p>

                  <p>Gordon questions whether the Dutch auction system is ever appropriate for stock,
              since it was developed for tulips, of which there is a finite quantity. He worries
              that people will artificially inflate their bids if they know that the company is
              planning on giving each bidder only a percentage of what they ask. He also speculates
              that the institutional investors may not bid, but will wait until the market settles.
              Whatever the case, there is not yet enough data to convincingly predict when a Dutch
              auction will be successful.</p>

              himself and maintain a straightforward attorney-client relationship. He wants his
              clients to know that his advice comes from an objective point of view, and not because

                  <p>Don Francis, a pioneer in the field of HIV/AIDS research, had a long history as a
              pediatrician and an employee of the CDC before he joined Genentech to develop an AIDS
              vaccine. He realized that the only way to truly combat AIDS was to develop a vaccine.
              He chose Genentech because it was the world leader on vaccines at that time, but he
              became disappointed when the development was not going anywhere and decided to start
              his own company.</p>

                  <p>Francis talks about the social problem surrounding vaccines. People are only scared
              of a disease and willing to endure vaccination when they see evidence of the disease.
              Because vaccines are very effective at wiping out diseases, he notes, society does not
              tend to be interested with vaccines. In general, society neglects preventative
              activities, but instead invests huge amounts of money when people actually do get
              sick, he adds.</p>

                  <p>The major market for the AIDS vaccine is in the developing world, says Francis, but
              there is significant demand in the United States with 40,000 new cases a year. There
              are a lot of unknowns in the business climate in the United States affecting the
              profitability of a vaccine. It is difficult to encourage investment when a blockbuster
              drugs would have a much higher rate of return, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Francis talks about how after 9/11, the government became interested in vaccines.
              Vaxgen shifted to making a small pox vaccine and an anthrax vaccine and has been very
              successful in these pursuits. Unfortunately, AIDS was not named as an immediate
              concern and was but on the back burner. Due to the unwillingness of both the
              government and private businesses to provide funding, Francis has now decided that the
              AIDS vaccine cannot be developed in the private sector and is founding a non-profit
              foundation to pursue the development of the vaccine for less developed parts of the
              world.</p>

                  <p>Neither private investors nor the government was willing to make the necessary
              investment in the vaccine, says Francis. Therefore, Francis and his team had to look
              elsewhere for funding. The formation of the Gates Foundation has provided the desired
              alternative.</p>

                  <p>The scary thing about HIV, says Francis, is the numerous variations around the world.
              Still, there is no scientific reason that it would not be possible to cover all the
              strains in a single vaccine; it would just be more expensive to create such a vaccine,
              he adds.</p>

                  <p>Francis urges inspiring entrepreneurs to follow their passion. He comments on how
              difficult it is to follow a social cause in a society based on capitalism. The Bay
              Area is unique in its climate of venture capitalism and risk-seizing attitude.</p>

                  <p>In Raikes' early days at Microsoft, the strategy was to focus on agility--to have the
              products run on a number of different computing platforms. To be a successful
              entrepreneur, you have to learn and respond to challenges that arise and adapt your
              strategy accordingly, says Raikes.</p>

                  <p>Raikes explains that PowerPoint was created as a new way to present overhead slides.
              Microsoft made the bet that people would be willing to change the way they present
              information and launched PowerPoint into one of their most successful applications.
              You have to listen to your customers, but you also have to see beyond what your
              customers do now to what they might do in the future, he says.</p>

                  <p>Raikes talks about how Microsoft's success at innovating business models equals its
              success in technology innovation. Before Microsoft, there was no market for a company
              that did operating systems. The business model to license operating systems was novel
              and helped to propel Microsoft to success.</p>

                  <p>Broad-based leadership is important to the success of a venture, says Raikes. Though
              everyone cannot have every skill, it is important to bring together a leadership team
              that has both a broad and deep set of experiences. Still, people should be hired more
              because they are passionate about what they do and willing to work hard, rather than
              their experiences.</p>

                  <p>In this decade, there will be a shift in the way small and medium companies do
              business, says Raikes. The next generation of workers will have 15 years of Internet
              experience when they enter the workforce and will expect great computing tools. They
              will only hire companies they can communicate with online. Small to medium businesses
              will need to adopt new business application software to help them communicate with
              customers, he adds.</p>

              Raikes. Life is too short to focus on money. Interviewers look for three things: high
              energy, high horse power, and the ability to get things done. It is nice to have
              relevant experience, but it is more important to be really passionate and willing to

                  <p>Hennessy answers the question: Can the walls between Stanford and Silicon Valley ever
              become too permeable? Yes, he says, there are situations in which a conflict of
              interest or conflict of commitment can cause problems. The break between academia and
              business should occur when the focus of the research becomes about productizing the
              research rather than about the research itself.</p>

                  <p>Hennessy explians that the biotech and biomedical space are characterized by the
              importance of patents. Contrarily, patents are not crucial in intellectual property
              companies because there are often many comparable ways to do the same thing.
              Additionally, most IT companies spun out of a university fail because they miss the
              market window, not because the technology fails. For biotech companies, success is
              much more based on the patent and the quality of the technology, he adds.</p>

                  <p>A good entrepreneurial company requires a variety of people with diverse skills, says
              Hennessy. Though there is a natural tendency to focus on the technology side of the
              company, non-engineering people are just as critical as the engineering people. In
              addition, the success of a venture is not based solely on the skills of the technical
              employees, but on the ability of the team to work together.</p>

                  <p>Hennessy answers the question: How do you get people to stay at Stanford when there
              is so much opportunity in the business sphere? He remarks that companies are great
              things, but they are missing most of what makes a university so appealing to its
              employees: the freshness and excitement of the students and the freedom to conduct
              one's own research.</p>

              opportunities will be harder to find, but there is still a big impact to be made.
              Computers are still way too complicated and could be doing a lot more for the user.
              Wireless technology will increase mobility. In order to allow the continuation of
              increased performance in computing, there will have to be some major changes in
              technology.</p>

              fickleness of the entrepreneurial spirit, demonstrated by the bursting of the bubble.
              Some sacrifices have to be made to stay, but ultimately, the Silicon Valley is too
              exciting a place to leave, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Hennessy explains there are opportunities for spin-off technology from big science
              government projects which can lead to startups and companies. GPS, which was a
              successful spin-off of Gravity Pro-B, is an example. He believes that the best
              environments for discovery and creativity are ones that include a wide range of people
              with different expertise. Universities are special because they provide the
              opportunity for people to work together and share ideas, creating a more productive,
              and more interesting, environment.</p>

              evolution of how one media, such as television, turns into another, like computers. He
              worked for a couple small companies before attending business school at Stanford. He
              then got into computers at Atari, handheld devices at Apple, and online music at a
              startup called Riffage.com. Following this, he came to Palm Inc., which is now
              palmOne.</p>

                  <p>Wirt talks about how the convergence of technology is an interesting trend that has
              led to an influx of multi-functioning devices. Convergence devices save space, add
              convenience, and can sometimes enhance the functionality of the combined product. The
              Palm Treo is a great example of a convergence device and functions as a phone,
              handheld organizer, wireless email, text messaging, web browsing and even a digital
              camera.</p>

                  <p>Though some types of convergence devices become extremely popular, says Wirt, others
              never catch on. In certain cases, it is clear why the convergence device has never
              caught on (like a washer-dryer combo), and in others it is not so clear (like why
              people never use the built-in calculators on their cell phones), he adds.</p>

                  <p>Wirt explains that the invention of the electric motor revolutionized the way
              factories operate. With steam power, there was one central boiler which dictated how
              the factory had to be organized. As electric motors evolved, it became possible to
              make small motors that could be distributed around the plant to provide power to
              individual machines allowing for greater flexibility. Now, electric motors are
              everywhere, he says.</p>

              found in countless devices. He was able to count 14 computers in his kitchen alone.
              Optical drives are another example of a device that was once very expensive, but has
              now become a standard technology and its use and application has greatly expanded.</p>

                  <p>Customers generally are not very good at knowing what they want for the next big
              product, says Wirt, but they are good at making suggestions for incremental
              improvements. The next big thing has to come from the product developers, but then has
              to be refined based on customer feedback.</p>

                  <p>Wirt talks about how the PDA is a unique product in that its customers use it for
              both personal and business use. Still, consumers like to have differentiation. PalmOne
              has segmented its product line, creating the Zire sub-brand, to better address both
              consumer groups, he adds.</p>

                  <p>According to Komisar, what distinguishes the Silicon Valley is not its successes, but
              the way in which it deals with failures. The Valley is about experimentation,
              innovation, and taking new risks. Only a small business that can deal with failure and
              still make money can exist in this environment. It is a model based on many, many
              failures and a few extraordinary successes.</p>

                  <p>A basic skill set covering finance, organization, transactions, strategy, and
              business models can be taught successfully, says Komisar. These skills are useful for
              engineers because they provide context about the personality and character of
              entrepreneurship. However, according to Komisar, having a character suited for
              entrepreneurship is something that cannot be taught, as being comfortable with
              uncertainty and ambiguity is something you either have or you don't.</p>

                  <p>Komisar explains that there is no balanced life in being a CEO. It is a 24/7 job and
              is all-consuming. After being a CEO, Komisar decided to cut back and bring his life
              back into balance so he could have time for all the things he enjoyed. It is essential
              to stay ethical and never put yourself in a situation where you can't say no and cut
              back. Maintaining a balanced life is a dynamic quest and changes as your priorities
              change. People who know and respect you can be a powerful resource in helping you find
              this balance.</p>

                  <p>According to Komisar, creating visibility and driving sales are two different tasks.
              Marketing channels are pretty well honed, but driving sales requires more attention.
              As an entrepreneur, you play a large part in creating the demand for your product and
              Google is not going to do that for you. You have to convince people that your product
              will save them money, he says.</p>

              intimacy with a company that builds confidence in decision making. Strategy consulting
              exists because senior management wants their strategy to be accepted by a board of
              directors. Contrastingly, Komisar's role is to come up with bold ideas and steer the
              direction of the company.</p>

                  <p>Max met Peter at a free lecture on the currency market held in Terman. The lecture
              only had six attendees and Max approached Peter afterwards to tell him he was going to
              start a company. Peter had lots of friends that had been involved in startups, most of
              which had blown up catastrophically. Still, they were eager to try it themselves.
              Peter had experience in finance and Max had experience in crypto, and after a great
              deal of brainstorming, they decided to do something with encrypted money.</p>

                  <p>To mark the first major funding round, the Paypal founders staged the famous Beaming
              at Bucks, where the Paypal money encryption technology was used to send the funding
              money from one PalmPilot to another across the room in a publicity demonstration.
              There was a mad rush before the demonstration to get the technology working and there
              was consideration of faking the event, but they decided to stick to the plan and
              miraculously pulled off the money transfer successfully.</p>

                  <p>Technology companies face four major development hurdles along the path to success:
              basic concept, the product, getting it to customers, and making money. Focusing on the
              last, the two prevalent business models for making money in the high tech market are
              advertising or partnering. After thorough analysis comparing the costs of different
              advertising strategies, the Paypal founders decided that, however unintuitive, giving
              each customer $10 for opening a new account was the cheapest method to obtain
              customers.</p>

                  <p>Paypal was the first company to file for IPO status after 9/11 and consequently faced
              much-stricter-than-normal scrutiny. Additionally, the night before a deadline the
              founders found out that they were being sued for patent infringement. After a
              sleepless night and rushed meeting with a lawyer, the suit was dropped. The process
              was so rushed and stressful that it remains just a blur in the memories of the

                  <p>Though Paypal launched the Palm model and the internet model at roughly the same time
              with roughly the same number of customers, the internet model took off while the Palm
              side remained stagnant. Consequently, Paypal shifted its company focus toward the
              internet model.</p>

                  <p>The negotiations with eBay were difficult because eBay did not originally recognize
              Paypal as an essential part of their business model. After a year-and-a-half long
              negotiation (and a few marketing ploys by Paypal), eBay recognized the Paypal's value
              and the two companies were able to agree upon the deal terms and valuation
              figures.</p>

                  <p>Peter's advice to eBay for the future of Paypal is to keep scaling the business. At
              the beginning, it made sense to integrate Paypal's product closely with eBay, but now
              they are starting to develop applications outside of eBay and these should be
              vigorously promoted.</p>

                  <p>The early merger with the competitor created a unified front that helped convince

                  <p>Google co-founder Larry Page provides several tips for entrepreneurs. Tip 1: Just
              don't settle. Especially with employees, it is very important to find great people you
              are compatible with. Tip 2: There is a benefit from being real experts. Experience
              pays off. Tip 3: Have a healthy disregard for the impossible. Stretch your goals. Tip
              4: It is OK to solve a hard problem. Solving hard problems is where you will get the
              biggest leverage. Tip 5: Don't pay attention to the VC bandwagon. Don't start a
              company just because you can. Instead, have a really good idea that is good regardless
              of the funding situation.</p>

                  <p>Larry Page and co-founder Sergey Brin started Google while at Stanford working on
              their PhD's. When the company grew too big to be run from their dorm rooms, the
              founders made a pitch to a computer science professor who wrote them a $100,000 check
              on the spot. As of 2002, it is a company of almost 400 people, it handles over 1500
              million searches a day, and it has been profitable for over a year.</p>

              company trips and implementing a dog-friendly policy.At the same time, the company
              tries to maintain an entrepreneurial culture by forming small teams that act like

              is serious about employing only the very best people. Because of the high profile of
              the company, they receive over a thousand resumes a day, according to co-founder Larry
              Page and CEO Eric Schmidt. Many hires result from these resumes, but only after
              comprehensive reference checks.</p>

                  <p>Google makes money through selling targeted advertising on its site, which is more
              effective than broad-based advertising. In addition, they receive revenue from
              providing search capabilities to other companies, says co-founder Larry Page.
              Surprisingly, the model used today is remarkably similar to the original business
              model presented to venture capitalists.</p>

                  <p>Google competed with several other companies, including Overture, for the AOL deal.
              Though Overture offered more money because they are a public company, Google offered
              more ideas about additional services for AOL customers. The AOL CEO decided to make
              the decision that was best for the customers and went with Google, recalls co-founder
              Larry Page.</p>

                  <p>Everything at Google has turned out perfectly, making it hard to determine which
              decisions were good and which were bad. Co-founder Larry Page remarks that they could
              have started the company earlier, but were working on their PhD's. Also, it would have
              been difficult to achieve the same thing five years ago because the market was not as
              advanced -- and technology was more expensive and less established.</p>

              When making a deal, it is important to let your partner win, too, and to form an

                  <p>No matter what language people speak, there is much information that is not in their
              language. Right now, most of the information available online is in English, but that
              won't always be the case. Google has been interested in translation, especially as it
              applies to searching. As of this 2002 lecture, automated translation is not perfect,
              but co-founder Larry Page reports that they are working to make it better.</p>

                  <p>Google has been caught in the middle of free speech vs. censorship issues. The
              Digital Millennium Copyright Act states that if a company removes information from the
              internet when requested, they cannot be held liable. If the company is then
              counter-notified, they can put the information back up and remain legally neutral.
              Google has followed this policy, says co-founder Larry Page, but it has nevertheless
              sparked controversy.</p>

                  <p>The first aspect Google considers when hiring is evaluating the applicant's
              capability of simply doing the job. Next, they look for people who can think outside
              the box, but still work within Google culture. Third, communication skills are
              critical for any employee, even engineers. Overall, co-founder Larry Page and CEO Eric
              Schmidt have found that if someone is exceptional at something, it is usually a good
              indicator that they are exceptional at everything.</p>

                  <p>In the beginning, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin tried to license Google to
              other companies because they wanted to finish their PhD's, but none were interested.
              Google was started out of desperation; they had no other option but to start the
              company themselves. Though the founders do worry about competition, the barrier to
              entry is continuously increasing as Google indexes more and more documents and becomes
              the foundation of so many other services.</p>

                  <p>When CEO Eric Schmidt started at Google, his job was largely centered around
              providing some organizational design. The culture was working well but the company
              needed more structure. He hired a financial and controller system, instituted staff
              meetings, and set and reviewed quarterly objectives.</p>

                  <p>Execution is critically important; it is better to have a simple idea that can be
              easily implemented rather than a complicated idea that has implementation challenges.
              Drastic changes do not have to be made overnight; it is a long road to success and
              each change need only take the company to the next step.</p>

                  <p>Jensen aims to spend his time on what he believes will have a long lasting effect on
              the company. Numerous meetings and events often take up a CEO's time and it is
              important to regularly take that time back for product and strategy planning.
              Communication time with employees is also important -- the most important
              responsibility of the CEO is being a custodian of the company culture.</p>

                  <p>Business at NVIDIA is going well -- they are selling new products and entering new
              markets. Though Chinese and Indian companies are threatening their American
              counterparts, Jensen is enthusiastic about NVIDIA's long-term viability. He does not
              believe that the industry is particularly scalable; having a thousand engineers is not
              as important as having the right engineers, and there is an advantage to being in the
              Silicon Valley where there is a spirit of innovation.</p>

              NVIDIA is traditionally a PC-based company, in reality the PC-market share is only
              40%. However, it is still seen as a PC company and it is important not to re-position
              the company so drastically that this market will be lost.</p>

                  <p>At the beginning, the product was an 'internet sponge' that could absorb information
              from a computer and be carried around on a keychain. As time went on, the idea went
              through lots of changes to become what the Hiptop is today. Hershenson describes the
              formation of the product as a critical mass process: enough stuff (people, money,
              time) gets scrunched together until the product comes out like a giant release of
              energy.</p>

                  <p>Danger has developed a low-cost combination device that functions as a phone, and is
              internet and email compatible, that is marketed to the young and hip. The business

              the devices cheaply and then make money on the back end.</p>

                  <p>The Danger product encompasses three major pieces of technology: the hardware, the
              operating system and graphical user interface, and the backend service. The founders
              drew upon their experiences at Apple and WebTV to know what to develop in-house and
              what to outsource. Looking back, they are not sure how it all came together and how
              they got it done, but it was a huge accomplishment when the product shipped.</p>

                  <p>Danger's first customer was Voice Stream, which later was acquired by T-Mobile
              International. Voice Stream was a small company looking for something innovative to
              differentiate themselves from the competition. They found that innovation in Hiptop.
              Danger initially treated them as a partner rather than a customer. The two companies
              provided valuable services to each other and the deal solidified Danger's business
              plan. Since Hiptop was still in development at the time of the deal, Voice Stream was
              able to contribute to the product design, including giving it voice capabilities,
              which was not in the original design.</p>

                  <p>Danger was able to break into the US market by convincing wireless carriers to adopt
              a fixed rate pricing scheme for the device, which is almost essential in the minds of
              Americans for using services like AIM and web surfing. The Asian and European markets
              are further ahead and calls are cheaper, making it more difficult for the Hiptop to be
              profitable.</p>

                  <p>The success and genius of the Hiptop brand is arguably in its marketing. Danger
              actually gave carriers the choice of whether to use the Hiptop name and artwork or
              whether to use their own. Out of 9 carriers, T-Mobile is the only one to have used
              their own name and, therefore, the Hiptop brand has become valuable.</p>

                  <p>The Hiptop founders designed the product in the way that was the most appealing to
              them. They had strong convictions about what the product should look like and the

              However, the innovative design won them over.</p>

                  <p>Kawasaki explains that hiring infected people is the most important factor. Often,
              how a person looks on paper means nothing if they are not enthusiastic and ready to
              work hard. All of the experience in the world means nothing if they are not bitten and
              infected by the start-up bug. He also tells you how to avoid the bozo explosion, which
              only leads to layoffs, and how to apply the shopping center test to know if you're
              hiring the right person.</p>

                  <p>There are typical ways to approach sales, but Kawasaki has three other ideas. These
              include the unintended users, allowing test drives, and the suck down theory - chances
              are the CEO is not going to be the one buying your product, but rather the people at
              lower levels.</p>

                  <p>Kawasaki believes that often soul mates are found within your existing social
              network, but there is danger in that as well. Close relationships outside of a
              business environment can lead to promising more than can be delivered. Kawasaki
              explains that it is a tricky process, and can be difficult if a soul mate is not
              fulfilling their duties.</p>

                  <p>Sutton illustrates two examples from his book "Weird Ideas that Work." He encourages
              people to ignore and defy superiors and peers, and suggests trying to learn anything
              from people who say they have solved the same problems you face.</p>

                  <p>Sutton presents three tips for avoiding the common problem that companies face when
              they talk about creativity but don't implement it, including making sure the people in
              senior management know the business, and simple ideas are easier to execute.</p>

                  <p>Randy has learned from years of starting companies that he has developed an addiction
              to risk taking. A benefit of young companies is that it is easier to take risks
              because of the size. There may be nay-sayers, but Randy's advice is to ignore them and
              continue on with your plan.</p>

              catalyst to make the budding business person strong, humble, and innovative. Think of
              it as a reset, he says, and something to make one re-evaluate and reset a current
              course of action. And furthermore, he advises, never, ever quit. Stick around until
              you get thrown out. And if you get thrown out, compete. </p>

              He recommends entrepreneurs conduct polls and surveys to determine whether there is
              demand for the technology in the market. Never commit to a large development effort
              without prototyping the technology first and taking it to a potential target market,

                  <p>Adams advises that new entrepreneurs ask themselves, what's the worse that can
              happen? and prepare for it. Hope for the best, but become comfortable with the
              possibility of failure, he says.</p>

                  <p>Verma talks about his personal transition from engineer to management. He is a strong
              believer in a technical education, and shies away from general management theories.
              However, he notes the importance of identifying your strengths, and what you like to
              do. Everything will fall into place once that happens, he adds.</p>

                  <p>Gifford has found that having The Foundry act as an incubator was the best method
              possible to help new ventures get started. Over the cycles of incubation, The Foundry
              becomes familiar with procedures such as the FDA approval process and clinical trial
              details.</p>

                  <p>Fodor, Steve, co-founder of Affymetrix, talks about the importance of continuing the
              scientific research within a company despite a perceived monopoly of the field. The

                  <p>Fodor understands the dilemma of creating technology for a non-existent market.
              However, he has seen over the years that as the technology has evolved, the market
              begin to revolve around it. His key to success? Staying in front of it at all
              times.</p>

                  <p>Katherine Ku, Director of the Office of Technology Licensing (OTL) at Stanford
              University, talks about the mission of the OTL at Stanford. Their main philosophy is
              to do what's best for the technology, and that doesn't always mean going for the top
              dollar.</p>

                  <p>Ku believes technology licensing is not always about licensing products and making
              money. It's also about fostering lasting relationships with companies and individuals.
              She talks about some of the interactions and relationships that Stanford University
              has with outside groups.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneurs must have passion. Passion and vision are the things entrepreneurs fall
              back on when their company goes through highs and lows. Bobby Beaver, vice president
              of technology at Zazzle, explains that the reasons for starting a venture should not
              be monetary but it should be passion - deep caring for a problem and the drive to
              solve the problem.</p>

                  <p>Bartz, Carol, CEO of Autodesk for many years, underlines the silver lining for many
              stagnating issues in the workplace. Making a plan for yourself is a good idea, but
              don't let it limit your scope. By bringing value to the organization, you are the one
              to benefit most. Learning is the most critical aspect of any job; if you're not
              growing, it's time to uproot. She also points out that bad managers are great
              teachers, as they are instructive in what not to do when you finally get to fill their
              role.</p>

                  <p>In this clip, Bartz, Carol points out that young workers needn't be afraid of a
              lateral career move. Ambition often focuses only on upward motion, whereas
              well-rounded experience in a number of departments - sales, marketing, or customer
              service, just to name a few - gives a career a solid foundation. Ladders are unstable,
              Bartz says, but pyramids have depth, safety, and strength.</p>

              is something everyone needs to do in their career. You will go from the highest highs
              to the lowest lows in a matter of minutes, he says, but it is the time that is the
              best and the worst of your life. He advices starting a business when you are an
              undergraduate student because you do not have a whole lot to lose.</p>

                  <p>Seelig, Tina, Executive Director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, walks
              us through a life-changing hands-on classroom activity where students are taught to
              identify opportunities in nooks and crannies. With five dollars in seed funding and
              two hours of execution, she reports on the success of the exercise, and that many
              students reaped over one hundred times the initial investment (and others built a
              business without using any funding at all). Look for problems around you, says Seelig,
              and convert them into opportunities that create value. Embrace the opportunity to
              challenge assumptions and identify true cultural, social, or technological need.</p>

                  <p>According to Seelig, if you are not failing sometimes, then you are not taking enough
              risks. Silicon Valley supports a culture of risk taking and embraces failure. She
              encourages everyone to take risks and not to get daunted by the fear of failure.</p>

                  <p>According to Keller-Bottom, when you are in a big company and trying to do something
              that differs with the core business of the company, then you are going to face a lot
              of resistance early on. Innovent faced this when it differentiated itself from the
              core business of Nokia, she says.</p>

                  <p>People can't be forced to be friends, notes Facebook founder Zuckerberg, Mark, but
              innovative entrepreneurs can facilitate a friendly work environment. He attributes
              part of his enterprise's success to casual, unstructured communication woven into the
              work day. His hope? To create the space for co-workers to freely associate ideas and
              stretch their imagination.</p>

                  <p>Both the enterprise and the end users are better served by a culture that revolves
              around rewarding great ideas, rather than the self-promotion of getting others to
              acknowledge the contributions of an individual. Mayer, Marissa, Vice President of
              Search Products &amp; User Experience at Google, believes that if you fill a room with
              smart people and give them access to information, brilliant ideas will flourish, and
              the need for a strict management hierarchy dissolves. A platform for the free-form
              sharing of ideas promotes an open culture and a flat organization. </p>

                  <p>Passion and momentum build when skilled employees have access to great tools and the
              time to stretch them in new directions. Mayer, Marissa, Vice President of Search
              Products &amp; User Experience at Google, discusses the groundbreaking company
              practice of setting aside 20 percent of an employee's time for creative projects. By
              her own assessment, nearly half of the company's most recent launches came from ideas
              sparked during this unstructured time.</p>

                  <p>Product decisions can be based on the company politics. But one cannot argue with

              of Search Products &amp; User Experience, by which the company bases its decisions.
              Google's approach is the take the guesswork out of product design, from functionality
              to shades of color, and they believe in the science of well-monitored and frequent A/B
              testing.</p>

                  <p>In product development, Google's Mayer, Marissa, Vice President of Search Products
              &amp; User Experience, believes that a small amount of constraint - whether in file
              size, pixels, or speed - fosters a lot of innovation. The lesson she shares? Too much
              creative freedom can make creativity unfocused. A solution with a strict set of
              barriers yields more concrete solutions.</p>

                  <p>Google has proven that if you build it, they will come, and their mass of tools to
              keep users logged in has been the crux of their success. Vice President of Search
              Products &amp; User Experience Mayer, Marissa elaborates on this strategy, pointing
              out that money - and advertisers - will always follow consumers. Focus on building
              sticky media that draws in a wide audience, and the method to its monetization will
              follow.</p>

              structure. In particular, she compares optimal strategies for the highly regulated and
              structured biotech market and the ambiguous mobile gaming market.</p>

              constituents, investors, customers and employees, are happy with the company. While
              they all have separate and sometimes contradicting motivations, a company's long term
              success is heavily dependant on its ability to cater to these three
              constituencies.</p>

                  <p>Wallace, Rick shares the history of KLA-Tencor to show that it is important to follow
              one's business model. KLA revolutionized the industry by starting to charge for
              service instead of just offering it up for free. In order to enforce this, the founder
              had to risk losing IBM as a client. However, his bet paid off, and IBM finally agreed
              to pay for service. This has led to a large and profitable annuity stream for
              KLA-Tencor.</p>

                  <p>McCracken, Joe, Vice President of Business Development at Genentech, describes
              Genentech's business model where commercialization takes a back seat to science. He
              differentiates this from other typical pharmaceutical companies and shows how this
              affects the culture at Genentech. He credits this approach for the successful
              innovation of several hugely profitable drugs.</p>

              and the growth in mobile technologies, it is a great time to start a company with a
              target audience in mind.</p>

                  <p>Larsen and Jim Breyer, Managing Partner at Accel Partners, stress the value of having
              approval in a regulated industry. This provides an excellent barrier to entry and is
              very attractive to VCs. Larsen draws on his experience from E-Loan and Prosper in
              suggesting that while it is cumbersome, if an idea is in the interest of the consumer,
              it is not difficult to obtain approval.</p>

                  <p>This five minute video captures the essence of a two hour workshop in which student
              teams must reconstruct a jigsaw puzzle. Several puzzles are mixed together and the
              pieces distributed randomly to teams. The teams are urged to challenge assumptions,
              leverage resources, seize opportunities, pay attention to the market, and to create
              value. Every ten minutes the "market" changes. The video shows the set-up of the game,
              the action, and several minutes of debriefing with the teams. In this two hour
              exercise, students must develop a strategy, they need to collaborate and compete, they
              must negotiate and barter, they need to be creative, and they must divide the tasks at
              hand in order to create the most value.</p>

              instead of being intimidated by them.</p>

                  <p>Scott describes his experience at Stratacom where for the first 5 years the company
              lost a lot of money and had modest revenue growth, and then after some refocusing of
              resources, the company did really well and was eventually bought out for 5 billion
              dollars. He explains that what changed was their target market, and not the people in
              the company. He states that identifying markets with high growth and attaching oneself
              to such markets is very valuable.</p>

                  <p>Greg states that the most corrosive thing that can happen in a company is to have a
              debate continue after the decision has been made. He suggests that people who are
              supportive of decisions which they were against are very valuable to an
              organization.</p>

                  <p>For a venture capital firm, the time they choose to invest in a company is important.
              At Mayfield Fund, Roberts explains, they either like to come in early and get a
              reasonable ownership of the company or take the less risky path of entering at a later
              stage. However, it is hard to invest in a middle stage deal where money requirements
              are higher and the concept has not yet been proven.</p>

              deal on advertising.</p>

              can choose the degree to which they remove the peels.</p>

                  <p>In the enterprise software industry, Tzuo talks about how there has been a shift from
              the "field-sales" model, where traditional sales representatives win deals from big
              customers, to a "two-tier-sales" model. This is fueled by customers coming to the
              website rather than the sales representatives approaching them, creating a need for
              another tier of sales people to serve as telesales representatives.</p>

              have a metrics driven sales model. Factors such as the number of people visiting the
              company's website, effectiveness of search engine marketing, qualification rates,
              close rates and average size of deals are all important metrics which help in building
              a baseline. Tweaking these metrics can improve results and lead to a deeper
              understanding of the market, he adds.</p>

                  <p>In the internet business, the threat from competitors for small and mid-sized
              organizations is very high, says Tzuo. For this reason, companies like Salesforce.com
              define the battlefield by not competing with big names. Instead, they cooperate with
              them to build barriers to entry by investing in technology. Acquiring the right talent
              from the industry further strengthens these barriers, he adds.</p>

              right decisions not only as an investor but also as a mentor.</p>

                  <p>Ray Lane, VC for Bloom's company, PodShow, talks about how his commitment as an
              investor goes beyond investing. He has helped PodShow grow in the market by building
              connections with the right people. He also believes that conflicts of interest between
              a VC and founder are mitigated as long as the VC's don't invest in competitors of the
              company.</p>

              low-risk management and high risk investments, entrepreneurship is the third kind.
              This style of investment is called accurate contrarian theories where raising
              sufficient money might help in mitigating risks, but does not ensure success.</p>

              taking controlled risks and finally, solving the easiest problems and not the most

              Financing strategy should reflect one's financial capabilities. 2) Focusing on
              distribution is important. 3) Understanding that the entrepreneurial skill set is
              different from what is required to work for an established big company.</p>

                  <p>Hoffman believes an entrepreneurial venture will face competition by either
              innovating against no competitors or against slow competitors. If a startup faces a
              smart, aggressive competitor, they must be really sure of what they are doing. He
              elaborates on this point with the example of 'Friendster' losing its first mover
              advantage to 'MySpace,' due to a lack of marketing strategy.</p>

              network for search and building an application on top of it. Such a concept not only
              helps employers to reference check prospective employees, but the other way as

                  <p>Hoffman draws comparisons between a general manager and an entrepreneur by giving his
              own example of becoming a general manager before starting his company. He also talks
              about the difference between an entrepreneur who takes wild risks and a professional
              general manager who is paid to mitigate risks.</p>

              building expertise, developing a new model by doing things differently rather than
              trying to change the model of a big company, and creating capacity to have more time.

                  <p>Burrill talks about how starting a biotech company is different from starting any
              other company in the world. In other companies, it is the customer who decides whether
              you will succeed, Burrill says. For a biotech company, the customer is 10 to 15 years
              away. There is a huge importance of regulators standing between you and the customer.
              Additionally, in the healthcare world, most of the products in the market increase the
              cost of the system. Finally, a biotech company is global from the day it has
              started.</p>

                  <p>As an entrepreneur, Burrill says, it is essential to constantly challenge backhand
              knowledge, differentiate information from insight, and have a healthy aggressive
              attitude towards trying to build something of value. A VC chooses companies based on
              where the market place will be in the future and not where it is today. In merchant
              banking business, it is not about how many things one gets started, but how many
              things one completes, he notes. </p>

              importance of balance in teams; 2) Understanding the market place and how technology
              helps in creating market share; 3) Raising barriers to entry; and 4) Financing and

                  <p>Despite the huge investments, regulatory burdens, and uncertain market place, Burrill
              talks about how venture businesses investing in the life sciences industry make money.
              He stresses the importance of creating a perceived value (which is much higher than
              the actual value) as well as taking advantage of global arbitrage of technology having
              a higher value in certain parts of the world as compared to others.</p>

                  <p>Perry addresses the fact that an analytical way of thinking and approaching problems
              from his advanced degree in mathematics was a huge asset for his role as the Secretary
              of Defense. He stresses that the logic of going through the steps of problem solving
              will help one build objective decisions about the problem.</p>

                  <p>Perry observes that one of the ways to tackle security issues is to hold back
              proliferation and try to get major nuclear powers to start decreasing their nuclear
              weapons. He also notes that the danger of nuclear weapons today is greater than ever
              before, and we should continue to redouble our efforts to try to find ways of
              eliminating them.</p>

              responsibilities that one can apply in both kinds of organizations.</p>

              is a period of growth. Phase three is the unfortunate setback that every venture will
              invariably face. Phase four is a stage for rejuvenation. The fifth and final phase is
              a transition for either you as an entrepreneur or the company overall, he says. </p>

              everything, including themselves. This is an important phase as it tests you, your own

              prepared for this phase as every company will eventually experience it, he cautions.

                  <p>Fiorina, Carly, former CEO of HP, describes simple guidelines to gauge ethics in an
              organization. She asks entrepreneurs to answer key questions about promotion and
              performance within the organization. The answers to these questions, she says, will
              reveal the organization's view towards ethics.</p>

                  <p>Often one person's actions one can impact the course for many. Former California
              State Senator Jackie Speier talks about the importance of standing up for a purpose
              when your passion is strong. She illustrates this idea by discussing what drove the
              people who initiated stem cell research and those who stood up against drunk driving.
              She insists that life requires one to step up when the mission is genuine.</p>

              in the politics of public sectors. She stresses that it is necessary for people to

              A board should clearly understand startups and know that as long as the company is in

              from a victim's perspective, studying different characteristics like yelling, abuse
              and screaming and looking at political backstabbing. Sutton says there are numerous

              originated. Dell was fascinated by the emerging field of the personal computer and
              disenchanted by the way technology was being provided to the consumer. To challenge
              what he noticed was a very lengthy and expensive process, he experimented with the
              concept of selling the product directly to the customer. </p>

                  <p>Dell explains the culture and dynamics of Dell, Inc. during its early years. The
              company was run by hardworking, versatile people who were action-orientated and
              willing to listen. Many of those early employees went on to fill important positions
              at the company later on. Some employees, however, had a hard time as the company grew,
              even though they had performed well when the company was smaller. At a fast-growing
              company, Dell notes, the job grows faster than the person. A certain kind of job will
              vary enormously during different stages of the growth of the company. </p>

              At the end of the day, an employee should be evaluated by how well they do their job,

              ready to go public yet because it was a young company without a board of directors. As
              a result, he formed a small board that turned out to be very helpful in bringing in
              capital. </p>

                  <p>Dell describes what he looks for his board of directors to do in a business that
              changes rapidly. He requires each director to select and learn as much as possible
              about an area of Dell, Inc. During board meetings, the directors report what they have
              learned. This method, Dell notes, is much more effective in increasing the knowledge
              of the board and understanding the business of the company. To ensure that the company
              gets a board of experienced leaders, Dell uses a well-established company process to
              evaluate their development capacity. </p>

                  <p>In 1989, following the year when Dell, Inc. went public, Dell explains how the
              company had a large problem with inventory management. As a result, the company failed
              to transition properly in the industry from one technology to the other. However,
              because of this critical mistake, the company learned how to correctly manage their
              inventory, and according to Dell, became the best in the world at it. Later on, Dell
              also notes the company did not have the systems and processes to deal with rapid
              growth. This experience, however, proved to be another learning lesson for the
              company, as it installed a much better set of processes that helped further its
              growth. </p>

              was done primarily to raise more capital, attract more people, and acquire a measure
              of financial transparency. Tens of thousand of employees that the company would need
              to hire would be easier to find, as there was a lower risk and widespread recognition

                  <p>Dell, Michael, Founder of Dell, Inc., describes three critical inflection points in
              the business model of his global enterprise. During the early stages of the company,
              expanding outside the United States became a top priority, even though the company had
              very little capital and people. An unprecedented on-site service program for PC's
              became a tremendously successful and unprecedented undertaking for a manufacturer, and
              eventually led to redefining the industry. And Dell also elected to go into the server
              business, making the enterprise well-rounded and multifaceted. These decisions were
              made through fair amounts of discussion, data analysis, and observations of industry
              trends. </p>

                  <p>During its inception, Dell explains how the computer industry was run by engineers.
              Over a thirty-year period however, customers began to have an important role in the
              industry, but many companies were still being run by engineers working to promote
              complexity. With complicated products being sold, says Dell, customers had to rent
              specialized software and hire consultants from the computer companies to get their

                  <p>To overcome the flawed model of the early PC industry (which benefited only PC
              companies, not consumers) Dell talks about how his company made the PC easy to use and
              less expensive. This approach is being used today to improve the IT industry. Dell,
              Inc. provides cost-effective IT services and products. In this manner, companies can
              spend less on maintaining their IT infrastructures and more on creating new
              capabilities. This allows for new business innovations, says Dell, which can stamp out
              the competition. </p>

                  <p>Dell describes the PC industry today as a jump ball environment where no company can
              stay in a strong position for long. The development of wireless networks,
              miniaturization, and the influence of the internet has changed the competitive
              landscape of the industry, he says. One of the biggest threats is the changing
              computing model. To combat this threat, Dell, Inc. is focused on online servers and
              storage, new online devices, and anticipating shifts in business. </p>

                  <p>Young talks about fostering great relationships with his teammates and learning how
              to overcome the competition by using his negotiation skills. He describes how most of
              the negotiations he has been involved with have been symbiotic. It is important for
              people to feel that they are not being taken advantage of because you will lose out in
              the long haul, he says. </p>

                  <p>Young explains how he was able to negotiate with former 49ers offensive coordinator
              Bill Wash to play some of his strategies. He would commend Walsh for his ideas and
              would add a few suggestions. Walsh noticed Young had good ideas and would eventually
              come to ask for his opinion.</p>

                  <p>Young explains how he dealt with the ongoing presence of news reporters throughout
              his career. He realized that many of these reporters commuted for long hours, only to
              receive tidbits of information from the 49ers team. By stepping into their shoes, he
              figured out ways to work effectively together. </p>

              and seeing the overall picture. </p>

                  <p>Young explains how he was able to overcome the pressure of being compared to
              legendary 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. The best strategy, he notes, was to focus on
              finding out how good he could get, not how much better he could be than Montana. This
              helped him move in the right direction and got his career going as well. Later on, he
              became known as the fiery leader of the 49ers. </p>

                  <p>In football, Young notes that most of his negotiations involved getting his team to
              perform better. In business, however, his negotiations revolve around financial deals
              and figuring out the unique and individual needs of each person. According to Young,
              it is important to achieve a comfort level with the other negotiators to understand
              what their incentives are in the business. </p>

                  <p>Edgar Bronfman, Jr., CEO of Warner Music Group, believes business is a circular
              concept that can be described using three words: believe, listen, and act. First, he
              says, you have to believe in your vision, your opportunity, and most importantly
              yourself. Secondly, you have to listen to the market and properly assimilate the facts
              surrounding your vision. Lastly, it is critical to take action, although it may be
              difficult for some to change what they have been used to do doing. </p>

                  <p>According to Bronfman, decisiveness in a company is key, particularly in decisions
              regarding employees who are not pulling their weight. From his experience, odds are
              that employees in this position will not improve. Entrepreneurs must learn that they
              have a responsibility toward the company, not an individual.</p>

                  <p>Bronfman argues that the problem with America is that while values of integrity,
              hard-work, the rule of law and meritocracy are exported, the advancement of
              opportunities is not. This is why Endeavor is such a powerful role model; it provides
              economic opportunities in countries where democracy cannot flourish. With the growing
              availability of opportunities he says, cultures change, countries evolve, and the
              world becomes a better and more peaceful place. </p>

              a set of filters to review and improve these projects. Through this process of

                  <p>Komisar explains how the original TiVO concept went through multiple transformations.
              Originally, the TiVO entrepreneurs wanted to create a stand-alone VCR box that would
              be sold by large retailers. Over time and with the guidance of Komisar, the
              entrepreneurs realized it would make better sense to offer TiVo as a service instead
              of a hardware product with low-margins. </p>

                  <p>Komisar relates some of the advice that George Lucas, acclaimed director of the Star
              Wars series, gave him in order to create compelling and visionary ideas: It is
              difficult to paint on a blank canvas, but it is easier to do so when there are few
              dots already splashed on. The notion of innovating around inchoate concepts are
              applicable to the entrepreneurship business, Komisar notes. </p>

                  <p>Komisar warns against the concept of a deferred life plan, when people put off what
              they really want to do for what is expected of them. According to Komisar, this is
              when you are deferring your sense of excitement and passion for what you really care
              about. Working hard is not inconsistent with the deferred life plan, he adds, but
              doing so for a product that you do not have interest in is. </p>

                  <p>Komisar talks about two failures he has faced throughout his career and the lessons
              he learned from them. The first was a company called GO Corporation, which failed
              after four years due to bad technology and planning. The second occurred when Komisar
              left LucasArts Entertainment prematurely to join another company called Crystal
              Dynamics. He was unhappy about the move and had no passion for its products. </p>

                  <p>Komisar believes there is evidence of new bubbles occurring in certain industries
              today, specifically in Web 2.0. The good news is that there are also many other
              industries, such as those in energy, life sciences, and healthcare, where bubbles are
              absent. He also gives advice on whether companies should seek institutional financing
              or professional investments. </p>

                  <p>Komisar explains that there are different types of entrepreneurs for various stages
              in a company using an analogy from his book, The Monk and the Riddle. Early stage
              entrepreneurs, like a bloodhound, seek out resources to get the company off the
              ground. To grow the company, an operation leader is needed, like a husky that is
              willing to pull the sled and get the company to a public market liquidity. If the
              company ever faces difficult situations, a rescuer, like a St. Bernard, tries to save
              it. </p>

              take advantage of new opportunities. These opportunities need not be created by the
              entrepreneur, he says, but by others and the market around them. It is also important
              to note that even great entrepreneurs fail for reasons beyond their control.</p>

                  <p>According to Komisar, the nature of the work in Kleiner Perkins is very hands on. He
              meets with companies every week to build their strategies, partnerships and
              relationships. For this reason, it is no surprise that many companies from around the
              world move their management teams to Silicon Valley to build the business; the
              ecosystem in the area is very reinforcing. On the other hand, this is also why it is
              difficult for a venture capitalist to back and support a company that exists entirely
              in another country. </p>

                  <p>William Sahlman, professor at Harvard Business School, suggests that when raising
              money, entrepreneurs should carefully select venture investors based on the quality
              and value of the partnership not funding terms alone. Specifically, Sahlman argues
              that although all VCs claim to be value-added investors, the entrepreneurs job is to
              find the investors who add rather than subtract value.</p>

                  <p>After discussing the four key elements of any entrepreneurial venture (people,
              opportunity, context and deal), William Sahlman, professor at Harvard Business School,
              argues that the greatest value can be achieved by "changing the game," that is
              changing the relationship of the core elements to one another. Sahlman illustrates
              this strategy with the example of John Osher and the spin toothbrush. To change the
              game, Osher brought in the most relevant people for the job, experimented to find a
              great opportunity, and reshaped the context in which he, his team and his partner
              operated to quickly capture the new market.</p>

                  <p>William Sahlman, professor at Harvard Business School, reflects on three things that
              helped John Osher, the developer of the low-cost spin toothbrush, succeed. Sahlman
              identifies three factors: 1) Reflecting on your experience to improve your
              understanding, 2) Looking at the situation differently to successfully innovate, and
              3) Scanning your environment to find new opportunities. </p>

              is not about possessing the right psychological traits, but that it is about a way of
              managing that is focused on opportunity pursuit, future orientation and relentless
              execution regardless of the resources one actually possesses. Sahlman emphasizes that
              relentless execution is the most important part?there are many ideas but what matters
              is who most successfully executes.</p>

                  <p>William Sahlman, professor at Harvard Business School, observes that almost all
              entrepreneurs and their ventures must inevitably change and adapt. In all the business
              plans Salhman has seen, he says that almost every single business has had to change as
              they discover their customers, their market, etc. So the key to successful
              entrepreneurship is anticipating and dealing with change.</p>

              people is hard and while an entrepreneur is bound to make mistakes, fixing those
              mistakes is critical. Sahlman suggests that interviewing is difficult because of the
              impetus to assume the candidate is the right fit, but entrepreneurs must expend extra
              effort to assure they have the right person or it can cost the whole company. And in
              the cases where a mistake is made, entrepreneurs must be ruthless in fixing that
              mistake quickly.</p>

                  <p>William Sahlman, professor at Harvard Business School, asserts that although
              individuals are important, teams are the central unit of entrepreneurial success.
              Indeed, Sahlman argues that the reason why many companies succeed is because of the
              team, not any particular individual, and so entrepreneurs should think carefully about
              breaking up teams as well as the effect that replacing an individual has on a
              team.</p>

                  <p>Leslie, Jack, Chairman of Weber Shandwick, discusses the lessons he learned regarding
              emerging economies and entrepreneurship. First, Leslie argues that the creation of
              freedom and prosperity comes from a nation's internal entrepreneurial spirit, not
              imposed from above or abroad. Second, Leslie suggests that an entrepreneurial society
              is at the foundation of a free political society by allowing individuals to be reliant
              on themselves rather than an authoritarian regime. He illustrates these principles
              with two brief stories.</p>

              Founder of Lemon Bank and Wanako Games, shares his three most important insights.
              Cesares counsels that 1) Entrepreneurship is a calling that chooses us--it is
              inescapable, 2) Time is our most valuable asset and 3) Entrepreneurs create the most
              value by doing the same thing for a very long time.</p>

              However, Cline qualifies this advice by suggesting that you pick a venture partner
              much like you would want your daughter to pick a husband. Not only does the
              commitment, capability and integrity of the investing partner matter but so does your
              importance to and relationship with the larger venture firm.</p>

              because there are fewer VCs and less capital available sometimes. Green argues that
              outside Silicon Valley and perhaps even in the Valley, the best course of action is to
              have to option to say no?that is to not raise money because the business is self

              a venture partner: 1) Negotiate from a position of strength, 2) Find shared belief, 3)
              Listen to your instincts and 4) Pay more attention to the partnership than the

              liquidation preferences, pre-emptive rights, first refusal rights, anti-dilution
              rights, board member seats, CEO replacement rights and full disclosure. In contrast,
              Frenkel suggests entrepreneurs should not accept a big valuation from an individual
              investor who cannot follow on or ?traditional terms? that are not adequately explained
              and justified.</p>

              entrepreneurial ventures replacing the founder CEO with an experienced CEO is needed
              for the venture to scale and grow. Friel argues that perhaps the hardest experience
              for a founder is to recognize that their company might do better if they were to take
              a different role than CEO which often determines whether the venture stays small and
              successful or scales to something greater.</p>

                  <p>Friel, Tom, Chairman of Heidrick and Struggles, discusses the challenges of building
              a great team and suggests that startups can attract great talent with a number of
              factors, including money, self-fulfillment, belief in the mission or belief in the
              founder. Friel argues that to attract and retain great talent, entrepreneurs should be
              generous with at least one or more of these factors and sufficient on the others.
              Furthermore, Friel adds only a great team can make the startup a large and successful
              organization and sometimes this includes the replacement of founders with a
              professional CEO.</p>

                  <p>Frankel, David, Founding Partner at Altirah Capital, cautions against raising too
              much money in an early round for two reasons. First, if things go poorly and the firm
              receives a lower valuation in the next round (down round) then substantially funding
              the venture will be difficult. Second, if you raise an appropriate amount of money in
              an early round and things go well you can always raise more money in a later round at
              a higher valuation.</p>

              20% to 30% of the ownership as an option pool and to think about sharing wealth in
              order to create a bigger pie rather than holding to tight to a smaller pie.</p>

                  <p>Green, Jason, Frankel, David and Cline, Michael, the Founding Partners at Emergence
              Capital, Altirah Capital and Accretive Technology Partners respectively, discuss the
              qualities of VCs and investors who add value to the business. First, Green suggests
              that investors should be a sounding board. Second, Frankel argues that investors
              should bring experience that helps the startup avoid time consuming pitfalls. Third,
              Cline argues that valuable investors both act as a conscience and help connect the
              startup to customers. Finally, Green suggests that entrepreneurs should do reference
              checks on their investors to ensure they make the right partnerships.</p>

                  <p>Novitsky, Donna illuminates the operational differences between a Venture Capitalist
              (VC) and an entrepreneur. She contrasts them from her personal experiences. She
              broadly talks about three differentiating operating nodes - strategy versus execution,
              technology versus team building and diversity versus singular focus. Novitsky mentions
              that a VCs judge markets, people and technology. An entrepreneur is an expert in a
              field and has to dive deep into operational aspects of the field and focus a lot of
              energy on building a strong team.</p>

              shaping a strong culture is one of the most important activities for any entrepreneur

              suggests that behavior--what firms actually do despite what they say they do--defines
              what individuals in the organization come to believe. Furthermore, the symbols in an
              organization, primarily how time and money is spent to reward people, also shapes
              culture. Finally, the processes an organization has for measuring and compensating
              performance influences culture.</p>

                  <p>Andy Friere, Co-founder and CEO of Axialent, provides five basic cultural archetypes
              into which organizations fall: 1) Achievement, 2) Innovation, 3) One-team, 4)
              People-first or 5) Customer-focused. Friere argues that ultimately organizations need
              to develop strength in all five archetypes. However, Friere emphasizes that
              organizations cannot develop all five at once. Instead, organizations can only
              successfully develop one archetype at a time, a process that requires a few years of
              focus on each individual archetype sequentially.</p>

                  <p>Andy Friere, Co-founder and CEO of Axialent, describes the customer-focused culture
              archetype, one of the five basic cultural archetypes into which organizations fall: 1)
              Achievement, 2) Innovation, 3) One-team, 4) People-first or 5) Customer-focused.
              Specifically, Friere suggests that customer-focused cultures value flexibility to
              service customer needs above other potential activities. Friere describes the
              behaviors, symbols and processes that build this type of culture as well as the
              actions that destroy it. </p>

                  <p>After discussing his five archetypal organizational cultures, Andy Friere, Co-founder
              and CEO of Axialent, clarifies that while ultimately an organization wants to have
              each of the five cultural archetypes, the way to achieve this balance is to develop
              one archetype at a time over a period of years. The five cultural archetypes that
              Friere describes include: 1) Achievement, 2) Innovation, 3) One team, 4) People-first
              or 5) Customer-focused.</p>

              idea for an interim solution for alternative energy sources to drive a car.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, describes how a startup can compete with large,
              established companies. Orr argues that to compete with large companies an
              entrepreneurial firm must think about the ecosystem created by the larger companies
              and then identify the problems in that system that the larger companies are unable to
              address. Once an opportunity has been identified, a startup's single advantage is
              speed: because established firms have different incentives that lead to inertia, large
              firms are often unable to match the speed and flexibility of a startup.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, describes the tradeoffs for an entrepreneurial
              company between being private or public. Orr argues that being public offers a
              significant benefit for an entrepreneurial company because it confers credibility and
              legitimacy which can aid the startup in selling to larger organizations. Of course,
              these benefits must be weighed against the costs and limitations imposed by being a
              public company.</p>

              counselors to help his executive team work together as effectively as possible. He
              suggests that this effort is vital because although there are many talented
              individuals in Silicon Valley, helping these individuals work together as a team is
              the most important element required for success.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, begins by describing two surprises he
              encountered when working with great people: first, how difficult it is for experienced
              people to change and second, how challenging it is to be intellectually honest. Orr
              then describes his efforts to overcome these impediments by cultivating a
              fast-decision making process focused on the facts and intellectual honesty. However,
              to achieve this environment each individual has to have a thick-skin and a commitment
              to self-evaluation, qualities that usually must be cultivated over time.</p>

              balance for people deeply engaged by their work. Orr recognizes it can be difficult to
              separate work and life, but that we must still make room for relationships that matter
              to us. According to Orr, this ultimately comes down to carefully allocating our time
              and energy.</p>

              world and argues there are many more similarities than differences. Indeed, Orr
              emphasizes only one difference between Silicon Valley and the rest of the world: a
              focus on speed. By contrast, Orr argues that there are many similarities, namely how
              hard people work. He suggests that people work so hard for three reasons: 1) People
              want to have an impact, 2) People want to be in an environment they enjoy and 3)
              People want to be rewarded and recognized. The key to motivating people then, is
              allowing them to obtain these three objectives.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, responds to a question about whether startups
              have a chance of cracking markets owned by big competitors. Orr suggests that startups
              often can find niches in big markets because they have greater speed to execution.
              However, Orr argues that success in a big market may be more than simply creating a
              niche but rather success is creating a large, sustainable business. Orr argues that
              the challenge of creating a large business is that you attract the attention of large
              competitors who try to destroy you. At the same time, as a company grows, it too
              eventually becomes vulnerable to smaller startups with even greater relative speed to
              execution. </p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, argues that to sell a technical product to an
              executive team, an entrepreneurial firm must focus on understanding and eliminating
              that executive team's problems. Eliminating CEO, CIO, CTO or CFOs problems means
              understanding and addressing their pain point sufficiently to overcome their fear of
              something new.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, speaks about lessons learned from applying the
              HP way to startups. Orr suggests that he has achieved great results from giving
              employees respect and dignity. At the same time, Orr acknowledges mistakes he has made
              in applying the HP way to startups. In particular, in a large organization, such as
              HP, there time for long feedback cycles because any mistakes from giving people too
              much benefit of the doubt are covered by the overall inertia of large company. By
              contrast, in a startup, there is little inertia and so the feedback cycle must be
              shorter and mistakes or problems must be resolved quickly.</p>

                  <p>Orr, Dominic, CEO of Aruba Networks, argues that the unique benefit of advanced
              technical training is not necessarily analytical thinking--this skill can be developed
              in many places. Rather Orr suggests that the benefit of advanced technical training is
              the courage to address uncertain problems with brutal intellectual honesty. For Orr,
              this quality has allowed him to innovate on the technical frontier while having the
              courage to recognize when he might have failed and needed to redirect his efforts.</p>

                  <p>Armen Berjikly, Founder and CEO of Experience Project, shares the basic concept
              behind the company: a portal for people to share experiences with others in a similar
              situation. He illustrates by giving an example of a young mother diagnosed with breast
              cancer. He notes that his portal offered her an opportunity to talk to people who had
              similar experiences and thereby making her journey less painful.</p>

              building a team of people with complementary skills by reaching out through personal
              networks and in some cases recruiters. On the other hand, he suggests that
              entrepreneurs avoid hiring from sites such as Craigslist or other sources where it is
              difficult to verify someone's skills.</p>

              emerge from relationships developed in school or work and that founding teams work
              best when the team members have complementary skills. In addition, Navin emphasizes
              the quality of students and colleagues in Silicon Valley and suggests that students
              take the opportunity to experiment with new business opportunities.</p>

              Police. Navin suggests that startup success relies on successfully identifying and

              bringing in the right team members for each stage of the company.</p>

              meaningful problem, 2) A strong team that had proved a legitimate business model and

                  <p>Ping Li, Partner at Accel, argues that open source can be an effective business model
              for some startups although not all startups. Li argues that the key value of an open
              source model is not the collective input of a broad contributor base--the reality is
              that the application creator almost always puts in a great deal more effort creating
              the application than the community. Rather, the value of an open source model is free
              distribution across a broad base of contributors and users without costly sales forces
              or overhead. However, monetization of an open source model is a little different as it
              requires offering optional value-add features that users may want.</p>

                  <p>Jordan, Rodrigo, Founder of Vertical, suggests that technology and paradigms are
              changing at an accelerating pace. Because of this, what made one successful in the
              past may not lead to success in the future. Therefore, Jordan argues that
              entrepreneurship is a way of life in which on engages and tries to stay ahead of
              change over the course of your life.</p>

                  <p>Jordan, Rodrigo, Founder of Vertical, describes a challenge in making the first
              crossing of the Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica, highlighting the role in optimism
              in allowing the team to shift their paradigm and successfully cross an ice valley.
              Jordan then argues that the entrepreneurs he admires have a similar, paradigm shifting
              optimism: despite the challenges and disappointments that his colleagues inevitably
              face, these entrepreneurs overcome their challenges with optimism.</p>

                  <p>Khanna, Tarun, Professor at Harvard Business School, speaks about the incredible
              change in aspirations among young people in India. Whereas in the past young people
              aspired to become government officials, today they aspire to become entrepreneurs and
              lift themselves out of poverty by their own actions. Khanna reflects that this change
              in attitudes is inspiring and very good for the country.</p>

                  <p>Khanna, Tarun, Professor at Harvard Business School, summarizes insights from one of
              his books by comparing private and public rights in India and China. Khanna argues
              that in India, private rights are favored over the public interest whereas in China
              the opposite is true. These tradeoffs affect the nature of doing business in each
              country and development. Elsewhere in his presentation, Khanna also suggests that
              India and China differ in that India has weak hard infrastructure (roads, etc.) but
              strong soft infrastructure (human assets, etc.) whereas in China the opposite is true,
              a duality that is clearly related to the public and private rights distinction
              discussed in this video segment.</p>

              entrepreneur, has been able to achieve incredible results unmatched by private or
              public institutions around the world by rethinking the scale on which healthcare is

              that government = inefficient does not hold unilaterally but depends on the context.
              To illustrate, Khanna describes the evolution of the Communist Party of China and its
              efforts to co-opt entrepreneurs so that now the government and entrepreneurship is
              very closely integrated. In contrast, Khanna suggests that in India entrepreneurs keep
              their distance from the government.</p>

              solution to a well-worn market conundrum. While a flash-in-the-pan Facebook app may
              draw millions of users in minutes, without staying power it's not viable long
              term.</p>

                  <p>While entrepreneur and former Lotus 1-2-3 founder Kapor, Mitch understands how
              selling finance can boost a burgeoning enterprise, his experience has also acquainted
              him with some of the disadvantages - mainly accountability and a forced schedule of
              progress. Here, Kapor outlines some of the many alternatives to the traditional VC
              paradigm, including self-financing and angel funding. </p>

              legacy of his wildly successful 1980's technology company: the management of
              free-thinking creatives. He stands by the quality of his products, but it was his huge
              investment in human resources, Libertarian management style, and incentives toward
              great job satisfaction and accountability that he's most proud of. He claims that the
              thousands of Lotus alumni have helped set the standard for how tech companies are
              managed on the East Coast and beyond. </p>

                  <p>How should an aspiring entrepreneur choose an angel investor? And, more importantly,
              how will an angel investor select you? Entrepreneurs need to gain access to the right
              angel - one that will add value to their growing enterprise. The top angels in the
              business, says investor Mike Maples, are seeking ideas that have been tested for
              market viability - an essential criteria before they'll consider cutting a check. </p>

                  <p>The numbers are stacked against the inspired business owner-to-be. Seasoned angel
              investors Ron Conway and Mike Maples talk about how many ideas they receive, how many
              executive summaries they peruse, how many meetings they call, and the shockingly few
              ventures - roughly one out of 150 - that end up receiving their investment of time and
              money. Also, Conway points out that investing is a risky business, with an even split
              between those that fail, those that earn just enough to pay back their investors, and
              those that turn a profit.</p>

                  <p>Facebook and Digg investors Ron Conway and Mike Maples unveil a surprising yardstick
              on what makes an entrepreneur's ideas a go or a no. Even though one venture might go
              under, the right executive could likely get another chance - provided they prove
              business savvy, flexibility, and an understanding that the nature of the business
              start-up is to morph.</p>

                  <p>A million dollars should last any new venture at least a year. And companies are most
              productive when they're less than ten people strong. These business axioms are good
              advice for any enterprise, says Ron Conway, investor in over 500 companies, and fellow
              investor Mike Maples. A lean and mean staff gets the most accomplished, and a low burn
              rate and ample experimentation are nearly always a calibrator for success. In
              addition, simultaneous customer development along with product development is what
              gives a successful concept legs.</p>

                  <p>From equity, to bonds, to real estate, MissionPoint Capital Partners co-founder Jesse
              Fink explains how traditional capital markets can be reoriented toward a low-carbon
              economy. Supporting non-profits is crucial in long-term environmental thinking, says
              Fink, as this sector pushes policy. But only for-profit business will catalyze true
              market solutions with pull. </p>

              between personal conviction and compromise, and Benninger points out why it's

              revamps the entire role of the animal shelter, including a pet-friendly community

                  <p>Whether you're running a for-profit or non-profit enterprise, the price point is
              crucial - and cheaper is not always better. The less people pay, the less value that's
              attributed, discovered Benninger, Christine, President of the Humane Society Silicon
              Valley, and her organization decided to raise the prices of animal adoption four-fold
              in the hopes that clients would feel they're getting a better product, and that they'd
              be more likely to keep it. Did customers take their business elsewhere? Hardly.
              Despite having the highest adoption prices in the county, the HSSV showed a ten
              percent increase in adoptions, with half as many returns. </p>

                  <p>Dan Springer, CEO of Responsys, offers advice on how to raise venture money. Springer
              suggests that raising money depends on three factors: 1) What you have to offer, 2)
              The state of the venture market, and 3) An entrepreneurs long term goals. Springer
              argues that it is challenging for an entrepreneur with little experience or just an
              idea, as opposed to a business, to raise money and advises that entrepreneurs might be
              well served to raise money when they have a stronger value proposition. In addition,
              Springer also recognizes that the state of the venture market also affects the ability
              of an entrepreneur to raise capital. Finally, Springer proposes that entrepreneurs
              consider the value of the long term relationship with venture investors when
              bargaining on venture deals and highlights the benefits of leaving enough room in a
              venture deal to ensure investors get a good return.</p>

                  <p>Dan Springer, CEO of Responsys, shares tactics for nurturing and protecting human
              capital. Springer argues that managers often make the mistake of giving unrewarding
              but urgent work to their best performers, which is a short term strategy that can lead
              to burnout and the loss of a company's best human capital. Instead, managers and
              entrepreneurs should focus on the long term and give their most rewarding tasks to
              star performers in order to nurture and protect them, because ultimately these team
              members provide the most value to the company.</p>

              problematic employees. Springer suggests that it is easier to deal with clear
              under-performers whereas the greater challenge is to address team members who have
              both positive and damaging qualities. Springer suggests that the best response to
              these situations is to have a clear and frank conversation with the team member which
              gives them an opportunity to improve.</p>

                  <p>Dan Springer, CEO of Responsys, provides counter-intuitive advice to young people by
              suggesting that when starting your career you should negotiate for the lowest possible
              title and salary at the organization of your choice. Although Springer provides this
              advice light-heartedly, he does so to emphasize the importance of setting up a
              situation in which you can exceed expectations and can rise to the top. In addition,
              he warns about the dangers of negotiating to hard for higher salary or positions which
              potentially make organizational members uncomfortable or lead to expectations that are
              difficult to meet.</p>

              suggests that the most important strategy is to help team members feel excited about
              their career path, whatever that might be. In addition, Springer has found that
              smaller rewards throughout the year for excellent work have a large effect in helping
              employees feel appreciated and want to stay with the company.</p>

                  <p>Google Analytics' Group Product Marketing Manager Crosby, Brett recalls how two
              brutal blows to his enterprise - losing a huge client in the 11th hour and the tragedy
              of 9/11 - forced him to reevaluate and streamline. Offices closed, jobs were cut, and
              salaries were strapped for maximum efficiency. Having the wind knocked out of them
              also simplified overblown contracts and software, and switched their strategy from
              making money to market dominance. The result included a better product, a better
              business, and a market presence that's still flying high today.</p>

                  <p>Analytics company Urchin was acquired by Google because of the professional look of
              their trade show booth - and because their product was quality, says Google Analytics'
              Group Product Marketing Manager Crosby, Brett. Here, he recalls the nine-month process
              of the deal, and how a leak to the press nearly lost it all.</p>

                  <p>Crosby, Brett, Google Analytics' Group Product Marketing Manager, shares a lesson
              from Michael E. Gerber's E-Myth series that's helped propel his business strategy: Do
              every job in your company, and as soon as you understand each one, hire someone else
              to do it. Too many ventures spend too much time simply focusing on product, and
              overlook this critical focus on process.</p>

                  <p>Why does Google hand out Google Analytics for free? Because there's more money to be
              made in ad spending, and because it's an altruistic solution for the digital
              ecosystem, says Crosby, Brett, Group Product Marketing Manager. After careful
              consideration at the time of Urchin's acquisition by Google, all parties agreed that
              keeping the web-based tools accessible to all would be the right strategy.</p>

                  <p>Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and Johnson &amp; Johnson all began as single-product
              ventures, says Imran, Mir, CEO of InCube Labs and serial entrepreneur of medical
              devices. And while the medical community is rife with single-product ventures, a few
              of them do go on to become large enterprises offering a suite of products in multiple
              markets. What sets the bar for each venture? The market viability for each product
              they produce.</p>

                  <p>Marketing is not an event; it's a cumulative process, says Jay Coen Gilbert, one of
              the founders of non-profit B Labs. Building a brand happens first with the community
              you serve, giving your presence heft and volume more than the sum of its parts. For
              the start-up, the best PR efforts don't come from money, as larger market players will
              always outspend you. But compelling choices - such as a provocative TV ad or a
              magazine title - are potent tools toward owning both a message and a distribution
              channel.</p>

                  <p>Building great corporate culture is more than just metaphors; it's what motivates a

              Wilcox, Ken, Silicon Valley Bank's CEO, reeled it in. By squeezing vendors,
              outsourcing labor and services, and removing unnecessary steps from business processes
              when it makes sense to do so, he managed to lower the rise of corporate expenses to
              just two percent in a single year.</p>

              business offers numerous other services, says Silicon Valley Bank CEO Wilcox, Ken. Way
              beyond simple checking and savings, a great commercial bank can offer a network of
              resources, such as advice on the logistics of company formation. And far beyond money
              management, the bank offers a powerful Rolodex of indispensable capital resources, a

                  <p>Housenbold, Jeff, CEO of Shutterfly, recalls how he learned that merging community
              with commerce was the winning ticket in business online. He recounts his days at
              Raging Bull, an upstart financial vehicle that knocked the larger, more established
              players out of the ring. It's secret? The site was bullish on building community and
              responsive to its users, resulting in millions of users in just a few short months.
              Furthermore, Housenbold credits the financial portal with two ubiquitous contributions
              to Web culture: The "off-topic" and "block this user" functions that are commonplace
              today. </p>

              cameras? Shutterfly CEO Housenbold, Jeff explains how an old-fashioned business like
              photo printing is surviving - and thriving - in electronic media. He also discusses
              how technological innovations are reducing environmental resources in the photo

                  <p>Shutterfly CEO Housenbold, Jeff rattles off a roster of quick and valuable bits of
              advice for the aspiring entrepreneur and employee of corporate America. Highlights
              include finding yourself a mentor invested in your success. He suggests learning where
              the money is made in a company, and building a career in that sector. Find wide areas
              of growth or turnaround and you will have the opportunity for broader success. And,
              uncover your boss' problems - and your boss' bosses' problems - and work to solve
              them. Don't dwell on titles; go to work to learn. Your intelligence is the ante, but
              it's luck that rings the cash register.</p>

              Learning to delegate and to build a team was one of the hardest lessons for
              Housenbold, Jeff, the CEO of Shutterfly, to master early in his career. With the
              insight of hindsight, he now sees effective team leading as a critical step in
              learning the right balance between career and self, and keeping the ego and ambition
              in check.</p>

                  <p>Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, never aspired to work as a banker. While
              he was teaching economics in Bangladesh, his country was in the middle of a famine.
              After speaking to many small business owners, Yunus realized that these small
              businesses could not get access to fair loans to start their own enterprises. His idea
              was to start a microlending program to free the poor entrepreneurs from usury and give
              them access to the capital they needed to get started.</p>

                  <p>Just twenty percent of the members in any group or social system own eighty percent
              of the assets, indicative that scale indicates a growing concentration of power. The

                  <p>We can't legislate against historical trends in the global age, but we can look more
              closely at the well-networked superclass - those who have broad influence across
              international borders on a regular basis. The Superclass has money, power, and
              influence - but it's woefully short on ethics in the global interest. Author Rothkopf,
              David (Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making) describes
              this influential core of the global power structure and stresses that economic
              prosperity can't be the only metric of a civilization's success. </p>

                  <p>Sheer brainpower, strength in numbers, and good old fashioned networking is how the
              nature of world influence is established. Skewed and disproportionate, modern power
              structures that regulate global problems happen only when the elite meet, says author
              Rothkopf, David. And decisions made based on these meetings often do not adequately
              represent the people or the interests that they are meant to serve.</p>

                  <p>If we don't recognize that the unequal distribution of wealth is unsustainable, then,
              perhaps, says author Rothkopf, David, more sinister political tensions and divisions
              will ensue. He advocates that the planet needs to reflect upon why we have one set of
              rules for our geographic community, and a different set of rules for institutions,
              among them the for-profit sector. Only when we hold the powerful players in economics
              responsible for contributing to the welfare of our community as we would a neighbor,
              says Rothkopf, will the interests of the globe at large become balanced. </p>

                  <p>If the people who set the prices are the same people who set the production levels,
              then it's not really a market, and true supply and demand are a farce. Rothkopf,
              David, author of Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They are Making,
              says that Europe is leading the planet in green energy technology thanks to government
              subsidies, including biofuels and wind energy. Rothkopf is optimistic that the US will
              eventually adopt these policies toward energy, though our current system is corrupted
              by nearsighted, pure financial interest.</p>

              if you're unsure of where your passions lie, simply revisit what you daydreamed about

                  <p>Inspired by Charles Lindberg's Spirit of St. Louis, X PRIZE founder and space
              entrepreneur Diamandis, Peter explains to interviewer George Zachary of Charles River
              Ventures that offering a high profile cash reward can often be more financially
              advantageous - and more aggressive in moving forward a societal push - than simply
              funding a good idea. Diamandis describes his incredible quest for funding, pitching
              hundreds of potential benefactors without success. Not to be deterred, he announced
              the first X PRIZE contest with no competing teams and not a penny of the $10 million
              prize money on hand. His unbelievable tale grows even longer as he describes how
              funding came from a bet placed with a space insurance company, and how he had to
              scramble for the $50 thousand premium every month.</p>

                  <p>Fundraising is simply an energy transfer to further your projects, says entrepreneur
              and X PRIZE founder Diamandis, Peter. It's also the most critical skill an
              entrepreneur can have. When trying to raise funds, it's critical to remember that you
              have to ask for what you want, and that you have to give others the opportunity to be
              involved. And, says Diamandis, never walk away from a potential funder without
              something; whether it's dollars, feedback to help you pitch more efficiently, or the
              phone number of another contact. </p>

                  <p>Traditional philanthropy invests in a limited circle of people, whereas the X PRIZE,
              says its founder Diamandis, Peter, funds a broader landscape of people and ideas that
              succeed. Diamandis is encouraging large foundations like the Carnegies and the Fords
              to consider adding cash incentive prizes into their portfolio of philanthropy, as he
              believes the rewards from this new form of public enrichment and exploration are much
              richer.</p>

                  <p>Chandrasekaran, Anand, Producer of Tapestries of Hope, tells the tale of a small soap
              maker who realized that the gum they were giving away as a promotional item began to
              outshine their core product. The company had to make a bold decision to focus on
              what's selling, rather than what they deemed their core competency, and the rest is
              entrepreneurial history. Chandrasekaran's lesson is that we should keep ourselves
              receptive to new ideas and new opportunities, even if they seem out of scope.</p>

                  <p>It's difficult to do and it's difficult to change, but a focus on putting customers
              first is the most powerful thing an enterprise can do, says Decker, Sue, President of

              thinking of their products and their technology as the forefront of the business,
              rather than a total consideration of the end-user experience.</p>

                  <p>When Yahoo! was a small company sorting through websites, says President Decker, Sue,
              it was easy to stay close to the customer through the three legs of their business;
              advertisers, users, and content publishers. But as they began their upward scale to
              500 million users, the systems they had in place could not hold. Their size and focus,
              Decker reflects, blinded them to the needs of their customer for many years.</p>

              funnel its content around an integrated audience. President of the company Decker, Sue

              But as Decker, Sue, President of Yahoo! explains, this sentiment also applies to
              advertising-driven online real estate. The front page of the popular search engine has
              always been a popular destination - and a great source of revenue for the company. But
              Decker explains why Yahoo! has chosen to eschew solid revenue in exchange for allowing
              that space to be controlled by the interest of its users - and the message that
              gesture sends to the Yahoo! community.</p>

              Executive Director Brilliant, Larry. The company made a decision to dedicate one
              percent of its profits to global causes. It took 18 months to find that unique short
              list of problems that Google could uniquely solve, at the right scale, with
              sustainable results. Brilliant also explains his philosophy of Ghandi's talisman which

              that once killed half a billion people worldwide. Through global unity and a
              concentrated effort, akin to what Google.org strives to accomplish in other areas, the

              the poor, and job creation. And the organization's Executive Director, Brilliant,

                  <p>Even after the first round of financing, budding start-up Amyris Biotechnologies
              didn't quite realize the potential of its assets or its market possibilities, says
              company CEO Melo, John. The company made a choice. And rather than exploring the
              limits of the technology simply for technology's sake, they thought instead about
              exploring the needs of the marketplace. They first looked at the attributes of
              existing energy sources, and then investigated molecular alternatives that can mesh
              with current capabilities.</p>

              founders, the investors interested in scientific progress, and the potential for

                  <p>How do investors gauge whether a company is one from a pool of thousands worth their
              resources? KPCB partner Seidenberg, Beth shares her firm's five measures for financial
              fortitude. In this clip, she outlines leadership, and how this is the most important
              talisman of a growing enterprise's success. In addition, she discusses the importance
              of large, fast-growing, under-served markets, and KPCB's willingness to take risk with
              new technologies. Reasonable financing structures and a sense of market urgency are
              also key indicators; being the first and being the best matters. Founders who are
              missionaries, not mercenaries, nearly always seal the deal.</p>

              technological innovation, says KPCB partner Seidenberg, Beth. Her venture firm is
              doing some work in Europe and China, but Valley culture includes education, technical
              expertise, talent, and access to capital unparalleled elsewhere. To illustrate her
              point, Seidenberg offers a case study that compares the ecosystems of Southern

              Road.</p>

                  <p>Less contingency planning, a smaller team, shorter spells of tinkering and
              perfectionism... Parter at KPCB Seidenberg, Beth analyzes the differences in
              efficiencies between the corporate world and the start-up environment. Retaining its
              nimble nature, says Seidenberg, is the best way for any enterprise to withstand its
              regular crisis cycle.</p>

                  <p>Seidenberg, Beth, a partner at VC firm KPCB, says that in the beginning of a
              company's life cycle, founders typically own the majority of a budding enterprise -
              often as much as 80 percent, sharing the remainder with seed funders. But as that
              company continues to flower and VC investors are brought into the fold, that number
              can drop substantially, with firms owning anywhere from 20-60 percent. Founders are
              motivated to increase their ownership stake, and the only way to accomplish this, says
              Seidenberg, is for them to increase the company's value overall.</p>

                  <p>Culturally, the differences can be night and day. Financially, the rules can be

              from afar, KPCB partner Seidenberg, Beth says her firm found the best entrepreneurs in
              the country and partnered with them, giving them the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;
              Byers brand. In India, the business community works more closely with Silicon Valley,
              simply assigning its partners to the ground and forging relationships with other
              serial entrepreneurs.</p>

                  <p>Though Conley had a great experience in business school, an area of study that has
              become very useful for him as an entrepreneur is psychology. The dot-com bust and
              other outside forces presented an unforeseen challenge in a time of uncertainty.
              Searching for answers, Conley came across the work of Abraham Maslow, whose theories
              helped him rediscover his original purpose in starting the company. Through innovation
              based on "higher" needs, Conley took a fresh look at Joie de Vivre Hotels, the largest
              Hotelier in Northern California.</p>

                  <p>Conley explains his own interpretation of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, learned in the
              context of the hospitality industry. As an entrepreneur, he realized that just as
              people strive to "be all they can be", so too can companies. Conley suggests that
              there are three steps toward elevating to a transformative "self-actualization".
              Conley believes these needs can be found in employees, customers, and investors. Joie
              de Vivre Hotels redesigned their business model, keeping in mind the "higher" needs of
              these three key constituencies.</p>

                  <p>Conley believes that employees perceive their employment in one of three ways: As a
              job, as a career, or as a calling. Employees that see their employment as a career or
              a calling tend to build relationships through excellent customer service. Rather than
              increasing advertising, Joie de Vivre Hotels invests in its employees by implanting a
              sense of ownership. In off-site retreats, employees at all levels are asked to give
              their input on the company's strategy. The results can be seen in employee and
              customer satisfaction surveys. In an industry where employee turnover can be as high
              as 70-100%, Conley's company has lowered its turnover to 24%. </p>

                  <p>Though Expedia was able to address the base of Maslow's pyramid, they did not address
              the customer's higher needs. Using technology, Conley's company was able to meet
              customer desires by tracking customer preferences in much the same way that Amazon and
              Netflix do. Upping the ante, Joie de Vivre went on to meet the customer's unrecognized
              needs by giving each hotel its own unique personality.</p>

                  <p>In order to match the specific personalities of customers with the specific
              personalities of their hotels, Joie de Vivre implemented a creative website
              innovation. Using an avatar and an online survey, the website is able to provide a
              hotel that is tailor made to fit the individual customer. In order to meet another
              unrecognized need of the customer, the site provides psychographically customized
              travel advice that is off the beaten track. As a result of this innovation, Joie de
              Vivre now receives 70% of its bookings through its own website and has won E-marketer
              of the year awards several years running.</p>

                  <p>When receiving complaints, Conley recommends that managers drop everything and
              immediately contact the offended party. Even if you cannot solve the problem,
              immediate response can halt deepening resentment and the viral effects of negative
              word-of-mouth PR. Though Conley believes that employees are actually more important
              than customers, it is important for employees to understand the customer's point of
              view and not become defensive when a customer complains.</p>

              Vivre was forced to ask investors to help out the company financially. Rather than

                  <p>The canonical product development model - concept, develop, alpha, beta, first
              customer, ship - is how Silicon Valley grew strong. But why does this process to build
              a business only succeed part of the time? And how can early stage ventures reduce
              their overall risk? Serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve points out that most founding
              partners strongly focus on product and ship. But too often, startups confuse
              engineering's accomplishments with marketing and sales success, and they pop the
              champagne corks too soon.</p>

                  <p>The odds of success in Silicon Valley are about 1,000:1. How can so many good ideas
              fail to find their place in the market? Too many start-ups burn too many resources on
              sales and marketing too soon, says serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve. Less than ten
              percent of start-ups fail because of faulty technology or engineering, whereas most
              allude success because they don't pinpoint the right market or the right customer.</p>

              Successful ventures locate real customers in the field, solicit their feedback, and
              deeply analyze the customers whose problems they hope to solve.</p>

              sets, says serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve. Investors are often frightened away by
              world class entrepreneurs who know how to build, but not deepen and enrich, a later
              stage enterprise. The tragedy, says Blank, is that the largest, best-known tech
              companies are still run by their founders - think Microsoft, Oracle, or Apple. The gap
              in this insight, says Blank, is of theatrical proportion.</p>

                  <p>Customer feedback simply cannot be outsourced, according to serial entrepreneur
              Blank, Steve. Here he shares an anecdote demonstrating the importance of founders
              speaking directly to customers. Blank recalls how entrepreneur Alan Michaels was
              forced to listen to customer needs and altered his product accordingly. These changes
              turned single-digit sales into the thousands, and resulted in an eventual $400 million
              company sale.</p>

                  <p>Start-ups are not junior versions of larger companies. It's a different animal, says
              serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve. Rather than developing a sales team or a marketing
              team from the get-go, Blank believes that a launching company should bring them
              together under the umbrella of customer development.</p>

                  <p>An entrepreneur needn't be a heart surgeon, but they must have an understanding of
              the tools a heart surgeon might need. That said, learning a business vertical is the
              responsibility of a great financier, regardless of its complexity, says Blank, Steve,
              serial entrepreneur. Without this depth of customer understanding - knowing their
              problems and why they buy - no new venture can succeed.</p>

                  <p>As the tech bubble was bursting on American soil, Mohr Davidow Ventures partner
              Straser, Erik realized that a tremendous opportunity was rising overseas. Forty
              percent of the planet's population is coming into a middle-class standard of living,
              and infrastructure and energy to support their desire for products and services is to
              become the driving force behind his career focus. This observation motivated the
              investor to explore the growing field of clean technologies.</p>

                  <p>Will the nation's famed investment avenue suddenly reach a dead end? The map toward
              future investment could be marred with tighter coffers in a poor economic climate,
              says Mohr Davidow Ventures partner Straser, Erik, though good and intrepid companies
              will likely continue to find backers. Alternative sources of capital are a necessity
              in a global financial crisis, says Straser, and emerging technologies will likely feel
              the pinch of the higher cost of capital resulting from the credit crisis of 2008. </p>

                  <p>Learning the history of Silicon Valley, says Straser, Erik, partner at Mohr Davidow
              Ventures, is the best method to predict its future. He suggests that students of
              business and entrepreneurship investigate the emerging trends in technology at
              research universities and elsewhere to unearth the Valley's forward focus. His advice:
              Find a lengthy, immutable trend that will permeate the next the 30 years, jump on it,
              and launch your career.</p>

              alternative technologies and partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures. Waiting for new ideas
              and technologies to come knocking on your door is a slow reactive strategy, and it
              won't produce leaders in the field. Stay meshed in the university research centers
              where innovation is being extracted, and the investor will attract the right
              entrepreneurs.</p>

                  <p>Venture is more policy-influenced than ever before, says Erik Staser, Mohr Davidow
              Ventures partner. For the first time ever, public policy has a horizon of investment
              tax credit to help facilitate long-term investment in clean technologies. Says
              Straser, the Valley is learning to plan its investment strategies within the confines
              of burgeoning and supportive policy framework.</p>

                  <p>Any "ism" is an extreme and dangerous thing, says McDonough, William, McDonough +
              Partners. And finding that balance between capitalism, socialism, and ecologism is the
              engineering of good design and sustainable development. Using a mathematical fractal
              paradigm, here McDonough puts forth questions that every ecologically- and
              socially-minded entrepreneur should pose to produce a product and business model that
              is simultaneously profitable, equitable, and renewable.</p>

                  <p>Any kind of government regulation on the enterprise is a signal of design failure -
              but also an opportunity to improve upon and grow a more efficient business archetype.
              McDonough + Partners founder McDonough, William points out that any business model
              that has roused government intervention - for pollution, carcinogens, etc. - presents
              an opportunity for better design and a more well-rounded approach to entrepreneurship.

                  <p>McDonough + Partners founder McDonough, William recalls the history of how his design
              firm came to investigate and inventory the marketplace of tens of thousands of
              industrial compounds, chemicals, and building materials, and how he has sought to both
              simplify and detoxify the process of product and architectural design. The supply
              chain is kinked with so many layers of products that even well-meaning manufacturers
              might not know the character of the toxic and disease-inducing compounds they employ.
              This industrial naivite has led McDonough to archive thousands of these industrial
              building blocks and rate their numerous properties and uses - and he encourages
              designers and inventors to consider this research in the engineering process. </p>

                  <p>McDonough + Partners lead McDonough, William points out that manufacturers can
              utilize the same resources repeatedly, and build a lifetime buying relationship with
              their customer in the process. By closing the product cycle - that is, designing goods
              with their deconstruction and reconstruction in mind - product developers are uniquely
              poised to deepen their customer relationship. McDonough cites a case study of a carpet
              manufacturer that employs Cradle to Cradle design. Customers "lease" the carpet, and
              are offered financial incentive to return it after its term of use, where the
              manufacturer can strip it, reuse the backing, and replenish the fibers into new design
              - keeping toxic chemicals out of the environment, and unwanted product from the
              landfill.</p>

                  <p>Forget every argument and industry lobby previously put forward regarding the
              evolution of green energy alternatives. For Khosla, Vinod, founder of Khosla Ventures,
              if a technology doesn't meet the "Chindia test" - meaning that it is cheaper than the
              current status quo in China and India - then it is not a viable, scalable, and
              cost-effective long-term alternative. Anything that will uproot the global reliance on
              oil or coal must be less expensive, else it will never gain traction in the global
              marketplace.</p>

                  <p>Oil and coal account for 65-70 percent of our carbon emissions, followed by the
              carbon footprint of coal and steel, and these materials are among the most detrimental
              to the health of the planet, says Khosla Ventures founder Khosla, Vinod. And too
              often, feel-good environmentalism gets in the way of truly solving the climate crisis.
              Khosla claims that most of what green-thinking activists do to try to help the
              environment is a mere gesture toward the planet, and that real solutions are going to
              require broader, more entrepreneurial, strokes of innovation.</p>

              the flow of user demand, which historically, says Khosla, always remains constant, and
              is a far greater indicator of long-term success.</p>

              influences the very quality of our day-to-day life. However, Estrin believes real
              innovations need decades of institutional push and resources behind them to develop.
              Here she asserts that we've become too shortsighted and more risk averse when it comes
              to developing new technology, and that this cultural shift away from innovative
              breeding grounds is to our own long-term detriment.</p>

              incremental innovation, which is a significant improvement on an existing tool (such
              as the shift into Web 2.0). Estrin also spotlights breakthrough innovation, which are
              significant revolutions in tools and thinking (akin to the discovery of DNA). A third
              type, orthogonal innovation, is about repackaging an existing tool in a new fashion to
              create a new user experience - consider what the iPod and iTunes did for the MP3. All
              have merits for the entrepreneur and the engineer alike.</p>

              genuine blend of cognitive diversity - members with different backgrounds, varying

                  <p>Leadership, funding, policy, education, and culture are all concepts that leaders
              should keep in mind when trying to foster innovation in any organization. Estrin,
              Judy, CEO of JLABS, breaks down these five influential elements and discusses their
              interplay. Effective and strategic leadership is perhaps the most important element.
              The right leadership and the right culture will facilitate adequate funding, strategic
              policies, and education that can contribute to furthering new ideas.</p>

                  <p>Nobody wants to fail, but we need to be willing to take that plunge - and
              self-analyze to learn from our failures, says JLABS CEO Estrin, Judy. If not given the
              opportunity to fall short of new goals, engineers and thinkers will be incapable of
              setting their sights high. Luckily for the entrepreneurialy-minded, Silicon Valley is
              a forgiving place, and those with great ideas are often given credit just for
              stretching and broadening new notions into the marketplace.</p>

                  <p>How did the floodgates of research, development, and innovation slow to a trickle,
              and how will the nation as a whole suffer as a result? Estrin, Judy, CEO of JLABS,
              outlines the depletion of the resources behind engineering, technology, and science,
              and how these areas of study have been denied the necessary nutrients to thrive. While
              we can't go back and recreate the great research labs of past decades, we can close
              the innovation gap. Should we fail to do so, says Estrin, entrepreneurs will no longer
              be able to find the talent to develop new ideas - or the science-minded middle-class
              consumer market to buy them.</p>

              eventually found herself volunteering for a non-profit and programming the largest

              critical management skills that have carried over into the start-up: the need to

                  <p>When Alta Vista launched, it indexed about 50 percent of the Web. Years later, Google
              launched at the same capacity. But the opportunity today in search engine technology,
              says Cuil co-founder Patterson, Anna, is that the outlay for the hardware required to
              search the ever-growing pool of content has become prohibitively expensive. In this
              clip, Patterson describes Cuil's alternative, mathematical algorithm to "scatter
              gather" search that is both more thorough and more efficient, allowing just 140
              machines to log 124 billion pages.</p>

              MacKenzie. In his book, "Orbiting the Giant Hairball", MacKenzie asks school children
              from kindergarten through sixth grade if they consider themselves to be artists. While
              the enthusiasm for creative free expression seems to run freely for the youngest
              children, the author notes some attrition from the idea starting with the second
              graders, and full-blown shame for artistic expression by the time he speaks to the
              sixth grade. The take-away from this exercise, says Kelley, is that we are all born
              with a high level of innovation, but it is the cultural norm to have these aspirations
              and pleasures flattened at a surprisingly young age. Kelley assures his audience that
              it is, indeed, OK to be an artist.</p>

                  <p>Like taking vitamins or exercising daily, Kelley, Tom, General Manager of IDEO,
              points out that fostering lifelong creativity depends on instituting good, healthy
              mental habits. This first habit on his list of five encourages thinkers to become
              hyper-aware of their environment, and to notice the common and everyday with new eyes.
              Capture fresh ideas and don't be afraid to use them later, he insists.</p>

                  <p>IDEO's General Manager, Kelley, Tom, shares a case study demonstrating value
              opportunities that arise when designers, innovators, and entrepreneurs see with fresh
              eyes. He cites his company's challenge to design a new children's toothbrush. Rather
              than relying on industry assumptions, his team did hands-on field research and
              discovered new ideas on how children actually go about brushing their teeth.
              Subsequently, IDEO's new take on an old product became a bestseller for their client,
              and caused an industry-wide re-design by other toothbrush manufacturers.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. Just ask Thomas Edison, the makers
              of WD-40, and vacuum guru James Dyson - who collectively tested thousands of ideas
              before finding a handful that stuck. But the point behind the practice of
              experimentation in innovative thinking, says IDEO General Manager Kelley, Tom. Take
              risks frequently, and be prepared in case the resulting action fails to meet your
              expectations. Fail forward, and there will be learning from your mistakes along the
              way. </p>

                  <p>Be confident in what you know well, but be distrusting enough of what you don't know

              cultivate a dedication to continuous learning. He tells the story of retailer Best
              Buy, and tracks their huge investment and acquisition of a large CD retailer which
              they thought was a good idea - except for that their target market had stopped buying
              music and started downloading MP3's instead. The electronic retailer was overly
              confident in their knowledge of the market, and paid for their lack of learning with a
              billion dollars in lost revenue.</p>

                  <p>Fine tune your left brain, but don't overlook the opportunities to let your right
              brain make its mark. Kelley, Tom, General Manager of IDEO, also discusses the use of
              the "hare" brain, meaning the aspects of thinking that we can control, and the
              "tortoise" brain, meaning giving though processes time to sit, ruminate, and percolate
              to slowly process creative solutions. Kelley claims this slower level of background
              thinking is even smarter than our cognitive problem-solving, and that it can be used
              to address dilemas directly. Creative thinkers should schedule some time for
              daydreaming to give these slower mental processes a chance to be effective.</p>

              you're good at, what you're born to do, what people will pay you to do, and finding a
              happy group of co-workers with whom to work. In the pursuit of self-discovery, Kelley

                  <p>Martin, Hugh, Chairman and CEO of Pacific Biosciences, advises entrepreneurs to avoid
              a common pitfall when it comes to the entrepreneur/VC relationship: Instead of viewing
              your board as an obstacle to be managed, think of them as a valuable resource and
              catalyst for opportunity. If you pick the right venture capitalists, they can easily
              be the greatest asset that your growing business can have.</p>

                  <p>John Sculley, historic CEO of Apple, and Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft, both
              demonstrate the impact that effective leadership can have on business and technology.
              Both of these large companies missed the ground-floor opportunities of the Internet,
              says Martin, Hugh, Chairman and CEO of Pacific Biosciences. But there is a lesson to
              be learned in how each CEO responded. Apple mostly ignored the Internet boom, says
              Martin, and faced years of weak financial footing as a result. But Microsoft turned
              the company around to establish a deeply-rooted Internet presence - particularly its
              web browser Internet Explorer - in just three days. Martin uses this anecdote to
              demonstrate how essential leadership can be in corporate success.</p>

                  <p>Chairman and CEO of Pacific Biosciences Martin, Hugh was quick to hire a top-notch VP
              of Human Resources - despite the strong objection of his board and his investors.
              Martin stands behind his unusual decision, and largely credits it with the company's
              success. PacBio's need to hire and integrate a highly-skilled workforce in a short
              period of time mandated the resources, says Martin, who hired over 1200 people in
              three years - many of whom were lured from the field's largest competitors.</p>

              previous enterprise, ONI Systems, was the first to be taken IPO after the dot-com
              crash of 2000 - and that they raised over a billion dollars in just a few short
              months. Maximizing the cash value of the company was a huge benefit to its longevity,
              says Martin, and being conservative with their holdings was an inexhaustible
              asset.</p>

                  <p>The more dominant a single brand is in the marketplace, the easier it is for an
              innovator to compete with them. So says Martin, Hugh, Chairman and CEO of Pacific
              Biosciences, who headed the start-up that once competed with dominant telecoms like
              Nortel, Lucent, and Alcatel. His reasoning? Monolithic entities in a sector get lazy,
              lose touch with their customers, and become overly confident with their price point,
              creating tremendous opportunities for competition. Upstart entrepreneurs should never
              be afraid to slay a giant.</p>

                  <p>To build an enterprise that can surely go the distance, Pacific Biosciences' Chairman
              and CEO Martin, Hugh suggests a short list of strategies. Among them, the board must
              have confidence in a strong management team uniquely qualified to make the decision to
              sell. In addition, don't staff your board with young VC's, as they are self-centeredly
              building a reputation and seeking quick and profitable hits. Also, the enterprise
              should strive to take money from funds that are stable and flush, else the firm
              backing them will be more likely to sell. This combination, advises Martin, will make
              a board less likely to cave.</p>

                  <p>Active users, engagement time, and revenue per user. Every Cooliris employee is
              issued a toothbrush with reminders of these metrics printed on the back, designed to
              motivate them to think about how to achieve the company goals as part of the daily
              routine. All of these metrics are critical yard sticks for gauging success for the
              start-up, and the kind of development that Cooliris CEO Soujanya Bhumkar wants his
              workforce to think about every day, morning and night. In this clip, he explains the
              company's powerful efforts to prevent decay in these signposts for success. </p>

                  <p>There is no substitute for actually watching your users use the products, proclaims
              Cooliris Product Manager Josh Schwarzapel. Viewing your web tools across multiple
              platforms with a multitude of configurations is an indispensable component of product
              research. And, adds Schwarzapel, developers and staffers who live and breathe product
              development in-house often become blind to its intricacies, and only a fresh set of
              eyes can provide the kind of clarity necessary for forward vision. </p>

                  <p>With 34 full-time employees and 25 interns, Cooliris has brought innovation into
              attracting the best talent. Here, Product Manager Josh Schwarzapel and CEO Soujanya
              Bhumkar discuss their company's unique recruiting process for both engineers and
              interns. For the former, Schwarzapel sells the company to potential engineers during
              the interview as he would a VC - striving to get them excited, and giving away a small
              piece of proprietary information in the process. To find the best interns, the team
              identified and recruited well-respected and hypersocial "connector" students from top
              universities to evangelize the company and hand-pick the best available members of the
              "party team". In short, Cooliris gives weight to finding the top talent across the
              board, whether they are board members, full-time staff, or unpaid innovators.</p>

                  <p>Briggs, Teresa, Partner at Deloitte in Silicon Valley, discusses why and when an
              entrepreneur would first seek the financial services of a company like Deloitte. She
              walks us through the global organization's client-hunting process. The region's most
              prominent venture capitalists, bankers, and law firms are tapped for referrals, and
              they lead the way to about 200 companies from their portfolios. Deloitte loses money
              on audits on pre-public companies with the hopes of getting a return on their
              investment when the company goes public. The financial firm also self-refers clients
              through interior channels as well.</p>

                  <p>When seeking new recruits, Deloitte Silicon Valley's HR team seeks leaders with an
              open aperture. With the help of her colleague in the audience, Briggs, Teresa, Partner

              who have interpersonal and client management skills, shrewd intellect and judgement,
              multiple and divergent academic pursuits, and, more often than not, the ability to
              speak multiple languages.</p>

                  <p>Christensen, Stan, Stanford instructor and a partner at <extref href="http://arboradvisors.com">Arbor Advisors</extref>, outlines a few of the
              erroneous career assumptions that land workers in an ill-fitting career. Don't take a
              job simply to build your resume; follow your passions, rather than guessing what an
              employer will want. The fun should outweigh the drudgery - even in entry-level
              positions. Don't feel that by taking one job, you're committing to a career; people
              switch teams often. And remain a generalist, rather than specializing in a single
              pursuit, as this will retain your flexibility and keep your skills from becoming
              irrelevant. </p>

              working long hours, Christensen relays a successful negotiation with his manager
              explaining his interests outside of work. He asked to be judged by the tasks he
              completed, and not by the amount of hours he was in the workplace. He recalls that the
              results were fewer long evenings and weekends at his desk, earning him respect and the

              than an emotional escapade. Other tips include getting promises in writing, and
              dealing directly with your future boss whenever possible.</p>

                  <p>Leaving a job is as critical a negotiation as starting one, says <extref href="http://arboradvisors.com">Arbor Advisors</extref> partner Christensen,
              Stan, and the last impression you make is even more critical than the first.
              Christensen offers two examples of employees who have left his firm: One who shared
              his desire to move on and arranged for a six-month transition plan, and the other who
              slammed down a same-day letter of resignation. He extols the first case as an example
              of what to do to facilitate a long-term positive relationship. He also points to the
              awkwardness of the second scenario, and comments on its dishonesty and the
              difficulties left in its wake. </p>

                  <p>The emergence of modern venture capital dates to the post-WWII era, and, despite
              Silicon Valley's dominance in the field today, it was born on the East Coast.
              BusinessWeek editor Spencer Ante offers a history of corporate investment structures.
              The notion of investing in a business with money obtained beyond one's personal family
              - the very crux of this high-stakes business segment today - was a demoncratization of
              the business world hitherto unseen.</p>

                  <p>From a $70,000 investment, the Digital Equipment Corporation evolved into a
              multi-million dollar entity, entitling its investors to the fruits of a 70,000 percent
              ROI. This, says author and BusinessWeek editor Spencer Ante, was the first home run in
              the field of venture capital, and the first inkling that this sector could earn its
              own secure financial standing. </p>

                  <p>How did Silicon Valley come to own the tech industry? BusinessWeek's Spencer Ante
              offers a historical perspective on the Valley's success positioning and usurping of
              the East Coast's market dominance. Ante credits a number of factors for the shift
              westward, including Frederick Terman, a greater acceptance of ethnic diversity, and
              abundant higher education. Venture firms that arose in the 1960's and 1970's,
              including Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, are still among the nation's most
              successful today.</p>

                  <p>Siebel, Tom, Chairman of First Virtual Group, paints a picture of the dramatic
              explosion of the dot-com boom; an era, he recalls, where "risk was a business problem,
              and not an anathema." With a 17 percent growth rate - an increase unprecedented before
              or since, says Siebel - the business opportunities of the 1980's era appeared to be
              unlimited. Changes in technology were total replacements, rather than incremental,
              meaning that every client had to buy and keep buying or find themselves lagging into
              obsolescence. He credits this free market flow with conjuring a revolution in
              computing and communications.</p>

                  <p>Universities and research labs force people to live on the edge of technology, says
              Hennessy, John, President of Stanford University. And this exploration, he points out,
              helps them to uncover that which is not obvious. Hennessy recalls a case study to
              prove his point. Thinking back to his first interaction with the Yahoo! prototype, he
              notes that the company's founders were motivated by a need for real navigation. He
              also talks about how the meaning of search evolved as the web's user base and content
              grew, and that Google's approach better met that market need. Both companies
              identified real opportunity and acted accordingly.</p>

                  <p>Why are companies that plant roots in academia or a research environment more
              successful than other start-ups? Hennessy, John, President of Stanford University,
              says that these research-heavy innovators are not only well-versed in their subject
              matter, but they are also optimists for their project's eventual triumph.</p>

                  <p>How can the academic environment begin to solve some of the largest problems on the
              planet? Environmental sustainability, energy use, and disease biology are just a few
              of the world's looming issues that require not just a single innovation for progress,
              but collaborative, interdisciplinarian solutions. It is the university's
              responsibility, says Stanford President Hennessy, John, to assemble diverse teams that
              can address these issues and offer them the resources to explore them. It is unlikely,
              he says, that these large global issues will be successfully addressed by a pure
              entrepreneurship model. </p>

                  <p>Though the ambitions of those who wish to start a great learning institution are
              admirable, chances are, says Stanford President Hennessy, John, that they lack the
              financial resources to make it so. Ten billion dollars is mere seed funding, says
              Hennessy. If one still decides to pursue the business of academia, he suggests that
              the rollout is slow. Start small and excellent, with a single great program, and scale
              gradually. Your organization will go farther than if you begin both broad and thin. If
              your institution is quality, it will attract top talent from across the globe,
              promoting its own future success.</p>

                  <p>During the 2008/2009 era of the government bailout of the banks, Stanford President
              Hennessy, John strongly suggests that executive compensation should be directly tied
              to measurable performance in any enterprise. He points to current research that found
              that the best performing companies on Wall Street - even during this stifling climate

              most dominant brands were initiated during depressions and recessions, benefiting from

                  <p>Michael Moe, a founding partner at ThinkEquity, urges those thinking of venturing
              into a start-up to consider not just the hot and trendy technologies of today, but
              those ideas that will permeate culture five or more years into the future. He also
              suggests considering demographics and how they are evolving. As example, he offers a
              snapshot of the US from the 1800's, when the average life expectancy and family size
              were quite different from modern day. These cultural transformations provide the

                  <p>If 30-40 percent of our time engaging in media is spent online, then why are only 6-7
              percent of all ad dollars going toward online media? Perkins, Tony, CEO of AlwaysOn,
              Michael Moe, Founding Partner at ThinkEquity, and Draper, Tim, Founder and a Managing
              Director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, all comment on how Madison Avenue must learn to
              bridge the gap between advertising dollars and new media. Furthermore, Draper quotes a
              case study of DFJ's investment in website Glam; that despite no initial business plan,
              new revenue-sharing models with bloggers made it the world's 10th largest media site.
              The panel also points out that for the next generation, YouTube is a more important
              brand than NBC.</p>

                  <p>Are VC's fearful of open access and giving away great technologies? Perkins, Tony,
              CEO of AlwaysOn, asks ThinkEquity Founding Partner Michael Moe and Founder and
              Managing Director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson Draper, Tim if they are fearful of free
              and open and its possible loss of profits. He cites iPhone applications as an example
              of great ideas with no clear vision on monetization. Draper explains that free tools
              are a necessity of viral marketing. In addition, the panel reviews the sales of
              mammoth online clients - Hotmail, YouTube, Skype, and possibly, Twitter - worth
              billions of dollars without a penny of revenue, thought to pay for themselves with
              their dynamic marketing impact.</p>

                  <p>Both parties are better off at the end of a deal, says Founder and a Managing
              Director of DFJ, Draper, Tim. By constantly creating a string of deals, market players
              create a network of people who will benefit along the supply chain. Do deals to help
              build the economy, says Draper, and you can build richness and variety in your
              portfolio. Even when deals fail, if you persevere the final sum, it will have a
              positive ripple effect.</p>

                  <p>Candidate evaluation and recruitment is a very difficult process, says Theranos
              President and CEO Holmes, Elizabeth. But it's not just technical excellence that makes
              the right employee. It's also a hunger for project ownership that is a necessity for
              the organization to reach its goals. Determination is a critical trait, and Holmes
              admits that recognizing this in a trustworthy candidate is a difficult skill to hone.

              Holmes, Elizabeth, President and CEO of Theranos, thinks back on what she wishes she
              had known when first launching her company, and in retrospect, she wishes she'd had a
              better understanding of how to build a business driven around income. She calls this
              the strong foundation for growing a business, and cites that it's even more important

                  <p>Cerf, Vinton G., vice president and Chief Evangelist for Google, discusses the past,
              present, and future of the Internet. Cerf predicts that Asia's cultural influence will
              grow as the continent's Internet penetration rates reach European levels. He says
              that, while IPv6 will provide enough Internet addresses to last through his lifetime,
              the implementation of IPv6 creates difficulties for the Internet in terms of
              compatibility, security, and broadcasting. Cerf describes the trends and opportunities
              of the Internet in the 21st century: the transformation of information consumers into
              information producers; the rise of social networking; the emergence of new economic
              systems in online games; the development of user-generated advertising content via
              streaming IPTV; and the transformation of mobile phones into multi-purpose devices
              that provide geographically indexed information. In Cerf's view, the increasingly
              lower cost of storing and transporting bits fosters a new economics of digital
              information and the emergence of new Darwinian business models that challenge existing
              entities to "adapt or die." As a result, Cerf says the Internet is an unprecedented
              and unpredictable innovation engine because its infrastructure enables people to
              invent new applications simply by writing new software on the edge of the network
              without having to ask for permission.</p>

                  <p>Everyone has a perspective, says Huang, Jensen, but to call it a "vision" implies
              elitism and exclusion. This NVIDIA Co-founder insists that those with a new idea for
              business approach the world with gravitas, and he cites his own organization as a case
              study. In 1993, his company's perspective was the first of its kind, and the results
              have proved a new sense of common sense and disruptive to the status quo. This
              perspective - not vision - allowed them to create new technology, new markets, new
              customers, and widespread success.</p>

                  <p>NVIDIA started as the first consumer 3D graphics company in 1993 and met over 200
              competitors in a few years, reports its co-founder Huang, Jensen. Yet today the
              company is the only remaining player in that sector, despite the deep pockets and
              global spread of others who possessed quality talent and technology. Huang attributes
              a pursuit of insatiable technology, despite the price, that delivered even more than
              the customer requested or needed, for their decades-long market endurance.</p>

                  <p>Pioneering a company is more than just building products. It's also about
              establishing a company culture, says NVIDIA Co-founder and CEO Huang, Jensen. How do
              you organize hierarchies and structures? There's lots of trial and error, but it's
              also an organic process. Huang asks students of entrepreneurship to realize that
              skills, intellect, and training all matter for successful evolution - but they're not
              enough. Builders need passion and purpose above all.</p>

                  <p>When you're in the technology industry,... if you're not reinventing yourself, you're
              just slowly dying, says NVIDIA Co-Founder Huang, Jensen. In this clip, Huang talks
              about market leaders' need to constantly cannibalize their own products, and how new
              ideas will force companies to abandon their own technology and processes on the path
              of progress. If you don't do it for yourself, Huang says, your competitors will surely
              do it for you.</p>

              competition does. And the function of an effective manager is to decide how to
              allocate resources for the best return, and if its pursuit is worthwhile for the
              enterprise. Be mindful of your best resources - engineering talent, the limited hours
              in a day - and evaluate accordingly.</p>

              not always plotting the exact outcome. If this is your comfort zone, says Huang, then

              incorporation, to hiring their first lawyer, to keeping a supply of breakfast donuts
              on hand. They acquired books on how to start a business, but never finished reading
              them - or writing the business plan. Their lawyer introduced the trio to VC's, who
              were impressed by their work history and market opportunity. This, recalls Huang, was

              spent brainstorming with managers and leaders and helping them brainstorm through
              tasks and opportunities. He believes it is essential to train talent to effectively
              control a different product line, a new geography, or even to take his place.
              Succession planning of a closed set of hand-picked individuals is a toxic process,
              says Huang. It's best to treat all employees as a next generation of leaders to build

              listened to her gut instinct, which leaned in favor of the upstart opportunity and the
              chance to work with a more stimulating, more knowledgeable team. Though it was a
              daunting short-term financial decision, the upstart job was with Intuit, which went on
              to become a very successful enterprise and the right path overall for her career.</p>

                  <p>A core fundamental proposition for building any new business must be a relentless
              desire to wow the customer, says PlayFirst CEO Baker, Mari. Think of every customer as
              a salesperson, and bring them solutions that are faster and easier ways to solve their
              problems. Maintain focus amidst a sea of customer feedback, and don't try to implement
              every possible functionality, else you'll spread your resources too thin.</p>

                  <p>What does your company stand for? How will you make decisions? What are your overall
              philosophies? These questions are easy enough to answer when the company is three
              friends sitting in a living room, but how are they defined for a burgeoning business?
              Baker, Mari, CEO of PlayFirst, urges companies at a turning point to put forth
              concentrated effort to define and pinpoint these policies and ideals, and to otherwise
              define a culture that can grow along with your product line. She cites as an example a
              two-day offsite meeting at Intuit when they'd bulked up their staff to 30 people, and
              the positive results that ensued.</p>

                  <p>It sometimes happens that a leader deems it necessary to take the company in a new
              market direction. And it takes a leader with courage to admit that they do not have

              Baker, Mari explains the circumstances behind her leaving early disease information

                  <p>Be conscious of the in-house messages that you send. Baker, Mari, CEO of PlayFirst,
              encourages business leaders to think about the values of a company that are reflected
              in its communications; for example, celebrating employees who work deep into overtime
              or who find the least expensive resources. The way you praise your workers is a
              declaration of your company values, and if not handled carefully, they can send the
              message that long days and bottom-rung pricing are the only way to succeed. Be certain
              that praise is allocated carefully and that its an accurate representation of what's
              expected and desired on the job.</p>

                  <p>Kick in the door when it opens, says Baker, Mari, CEO of PlayFirst, on her former
              affiliation with VC firm Kleiner Perkins. She transitioned from her executive roll at
              BabyCetner and soon sat in on pitch meetings, reviewing the portfolios of numerous
              start-up companies. Along the way, she took on an appreciation for the difficult
              choices made by venture capitalists. The experience taught her to be more thoughtful
              of approaching firms for future capital. It also solidified her understanding that
              being funded is more than just asking for cash; it's establishing a long-term
              relationship between the company and its funders.</p>

              and mobile technologies, as they've allowed for unprecedented, accelerated, broader
              markets than ever before conceivable. Truly understand the economics of distribution;
              Sandberg, Sheryl, Facebook's COO talks about old print media and music and how they've
              been trumped by the free distribution of the Web. She strongly encourages those
              venturing into business to take this business angle into account.</p>

                  <p>Sandberg, Sheryl, COO of Facebook, talks about the importance of communication in
              scaling one's own career and business relationships. She recommends that rather than
              stating opinions as facts, managers state beliefs and the facts that support it, and
              encourage others to do the same, as a tool to encourage better information sharing.
              She also encourages everyone to take full responsibility for the actions, and to make
              them personal, stating that this ownership is a crucial building block at all stages
              of one's career.</p>

                  <p>Steve Perricone, Co-founder of BioFuelBox, explains how his alternative fuel company
              solves multiple problems in waste refuse, energy production and distribution, across
              multiple platforms. By converting industrial food waste into biodiesel in remote
              areas, the company is reducing refuse by repurposing free raw materials into fuel, and
              reducing the resources necessary to ship fuel to remote and isolated areas. In this
              clip, Perricone's investor, Jennifer Scott Fonstad, Managing Director of Draper Fisher
              Jurvetson, also explains interest in the idea from a VC perspective and their belief
              in its global potential. Perricone also explains the BioFuelBox business model, which
              simply sells the recovered fuel back to the production plant, and gives them financial
              incentive as part of the revenue-share.</p>

                  <p>How does a young company decide to go out for venture capital rather than bootstrap
              themselves? For Steve Perricone, Co-founder of BioFuelBox, it all comes down to speed
              to market. And, he says, in Silicon Valley, speed is a key motivator to seeking
              outside funding. He also points out the other values of VC beyond cash, including
              wisdom and relationships within the industry, assistance in building a strong board,
              and, most importantly, the credibility that the right partner can lend. </p>

              Washington, DC and the decisions being made surrounding the funding of clean energy.
              And, Jennifer Scott Fonstad, Managing Director of venture capital firm DFJ, discusses
              the necessity of companies like BioFuelBox to establish a consortium of both
              industrial food waste producers and those on the energy side. Her hope is that a
              collective effort will prove that a network of new technologies in energy could
              provide numerous jobs and other revenue opportunities.</p>

              barring his desire to study the neural cortex, Hawkins, Jeff, Founder of Numenta,
              decided to think long-term. He put a career plan in place that has lasted over twenty
              years. Rather than pursuing his passions through academia, he decided instead to focus
              on making institutional change, adding credibility to his name, earning substantial
              financial revenues to fund his own pet projects, and helping the neuroscience
              community mature from the inside. Two decades later, arguably, he's accomplished all
              of these tasks, and he's still expanding their boundaries.</p>

              wanted their primary personal computer to be in their pocket, thus he launched Palm in
              1992. The self-described "reluctant entrepreneur" says that he never intended to
              launch a mobile computer industry (or any company, for that matter) and he describes
              how he negotiated a limited, part-time relationship with the company, despite the
              hopes of his investors. He describes in detail the organization's first big failure
              and its first huge success with the Palm Pilot, and a timeline of the company at
              large.</p>

                  <p>Launching a non-profit organization is just as much work as starting a for-profit
              business, says Numenta Founder Hawkins, Jeff. Many of the issues and struggles of
              leadership are the same, including concerns about funding, building, mission
              statements, staffing, etc. Hawkins recalls that the Redwood Neuroscience Institute,
              focused on neocortical theory in the field of neuroscience, was so successful that
              they were forced to think of their next steps after just three years in operation. A
              friend showed him how to plot the institute's theories into mathematical planning
              software, and Numenta, a for-profit entity, was born.</p>

                  <p>Throughout his thirty-year career launching four start-up organizations (including
              founding Numenta), Hawkins, Jeff has always sworn that the would be home for breakfast
              and dinner with his family every day. In this clip, Hawkins dispels the myth that
              launching an organization requires long office hours and frequent travel.
              Entrepreneurs, he says, can be effective without having to work hard. They do,
              however, have to make the right choices. Any organization that focuses on making
              better daily decisions will have the opportunity for broad and deep success.</p>

                  <p>Hawkins, Jeff, Founder of Numenta, encourages entrepreneurs to involve people in
              their problems and to solicit as many qualified opinions as they can. Don't get
              tangled in product secrecy and idea ownership at the expense of gaining quality
              feedback. Instead, he says, be happy that anyone is willing to listen to your ideas
              and offer the benefit of their expertise. And when it comes to investors, have them
              involved as much as possible so that they, too, can share the weight of the worry.</p>

              two - among them the Palm Pilot - were very successful, half were good, and the
              remaining were market failures. Here, Hawkins discusses his thinking behind some of
              his product flops. He also tells the story of a fulfillment disaster that occurred
              with the launch of the Handspring Visor. After the online ordering system failed,
              every one of the product's tens of thousands of customers had to be called
              individually and asked if they'd received their order.</p>

                  <p>Despite Microsoft's desire to crush the fledgeling Palm Pilot in the 1990's, Hawkins,
              Jeff, Palm's former Co-founder and now the Founder of Numenta, decided to battle on a
              ground where the behemoth from Seattle could not compete: In the field of elegant
              design. Hawkins' focus was to make the product as beautiful as possible, and they
              hired acclaimed design firm IDEO to design the Palm IV. Not only was it easy on the
              eyes and easy to use, but it was the first consumer product with a lithium battery,
              and the first to use glue, rather than screws, for seamless closure. </p>

                  <p>Touch, voice, natural language input, smart hardware, and new platforms: Ballmer,
              Steve, Microsoft CEO, outlines the company's $9 million path of product research for
              2009. Overall, he states that the company is optimistic for what can be created in the
              future. In this clip, he talks about the company's strong need to create and innovate
              just like a start-up - despite the fact that they're one of the largest names in the
              industry.</p>

                  <p>More venture capital means more companies, but it does not necessarily mean more
              innovation, says Ballmer, Steve, CEO of Microsoft. And on that same token, the
              restrictions in financing that resulted from the financial crisis of 2008/2009 will
              not necessarily quash the future of innovation, either. Ballmer believes that the best
              ideas in technology - true next steps - will come to light despite even amidst the
              most inhospitable market conditions.</p>

                  <p>Ballmer, Steve, Microsoft's CEO, considers the importance of balance and the tension

              patience and meeting short-term goals, and teetering between a passion for technology
              and a passion for the customer. </p>

              dreamed that he would have to grow the company from the ground up. In this amusing
              anecdote on the roots of Microsoft's salad days, the company CEO recalls how he he
              took on the business responsibilities at the fledgeling start-up. At Bill Gates'
              invitation, Ballmer took on a low-risk summer job, never dreaming that it would result
              in one of the largest industry players enduring for over three decades. </p>

              to be a "mini venture capitalist" in a sea of bright ideas and new market
              possibilities. Working with the best and the brightest, his is the final word on tough
              decisions regarding which ideas and projects receive funding and other in-house
              resources from the company's limited pool. New products come and go with varying
              success, but by staying focused on core-competancies and core-strategies, says
              Ballmer, the right decisions will always come to light.</p>

                  <p>After just one year at Stanford's business school before joining Microsoft, Ballmer,
              Steve reflects upon the knowledge and courses that were most valuable to him in the
              real world. He recalls that it came in handy to read a balance sheet and understand
              the basics of cost accounting. Courses of study that were particularly helpful include
              business policy and management of arts organizations, which, he says, is more akin to
              managing engineers and scientists than one would think. STVP's Seelig, Tina also asks
              Ballmer to reflect upon what he wishes he'd learned. In retrospect, if he could
              retrace his steps in academia, his desire would be to take more computer science
              classes. </p>

              tech company IPO's, that will also help add new stems and leaves to the economy. As an
              aside, he also parallels the difference between US start-ups, enabled by the safety
              net of a VC-backed ecosystem, and their Chinese counterparts, who are forced to be
              profitable immediately or shutter.</p>

                  <p>Seelig, Tina, Executive Director of Stanford Technology Ventures Program, speaks
              about the lesson that is the crux of entrepreneurship: All problems are opportunities,
              and the larger the problem, the grander the opportunity. Furthermore, she talks about
              the challenges that arise in the methods for teaching these concepts, and the
              necessity to get people out of their comfort zone in order to encourage creative
              problem-solving. This clip also includes a video quote from Khosla, Vinod. </p>

                  <p>If you had five dollars and two hours, what would you do to make as much money as
              possible? In this clip, STVP Executive Director Seelig, Tina recalls a classroom
              exercise in creative thinking and entrepreneurship that posed this quandry to student
              teams. The results were manifold and varied, often taking advantage of ly needed
              services, niche markets, and valuable time. These in-class experiments contain many
              valuable lessons on creative thinking in the start-up realm, including skills, ideas,
              and innovation as assets that always lend value.</p>

                  <p>Solving problems is an important aspect of entrepreneurship, but it's not the entire
              solution. Aspiring students also need to learn how to make their own good luck, says
              STVP Executive Director Seelig, Tina. Hard work is imperative, but it doesn't always
              mean a fortunate outcome. It takes optimism, an open mind, shrewd networking skills,
              and the ability to find the veiled "million dollars in the room." Seelig cites a
              personal anecdote where, through perseverance and curiosity, she turned an encounter
              with a stranger over frozen lemonade in a grocery store into a long-lasting
              relationship and a helicopter ride to a private ski resort overseas.</p>

                  <p>What's the secret sauce of Silicon Valley? Failure, reports Seelig, Tina, Executive
              Director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. To develop more successes, she
              urges, entrepreneurs have got to take a risk, and this is the notion behind every deal
              in the entire ecosystem. Venture capitalists fund risk and, by association, failure,
              in order to find the "hits" in the haystack. Failure is a perfectly acceptable part of
              the entrepreneurial process, provided that the smart entrepreneur learns from their
              errors along the way.</p>

                  <p>Don't think of a job as just getting a desk and a job description. Seelig, Tina,
              Executive Director of Stanford Technology Ventures Program, points out that landing a
              job means getting a key to the building. And what that key unlocks is entirely up to
              you. The endless possibilities of creating work, new projects, and developing ideas
              that cater to your passions are available to any employee in any office. Seelig urges
              entrepreneurial thinking in the workplace, and tells students that they should build
              the ladder below themselves, rather than waiting for someone else to put it before
              them.</p>

                  <p>With no business model and a company that was barely solvent, Baidu CEO Li, Robin
              quickly realized that his customer base didn't want to buy the best technology; only
              the cheapest. The entire strategy of his company needed to change, and he revamped his
              enterprise from a back-end search utility to a front-end, consumer-focused provider.
              Since making this change in 2001, Baidu has gone on to become one of the most
              successful online search tools on the planet.</p>

                  <p>Described as not just a function of search, but a "vision for our future", the CEO of
              Baidu, Li, Robin, talks about the continuing emergence of the "magic" search box as
              the primary tool for browserless, consolidated information gathering. He also
              discusses at length how search terms have evolved - no longer just subject queries,
              but users hunting for everything from weather and movie time information, arithmetic
              solutions, and even dating help. From his stance, the empty box awaiting information
              is the simplest, easiest-to-learn computing platform, operating independently of
              location, operating system, or application.</p>

              China, but few from this labor pool have the experience necessary to help an
              innovative company grow, says Li, Robin, CEO of search engine Baidu. And, he points

              his company also outline the qualities that they seek in incoming talent - including a

                  <p>The pivotal points that changed the direction of Baidu's emergence, says its CEO Li,
              Robin, include fewer extravagant expenditures (and planning for six months of capital
              to last for over a year), a switch from a back-end to a consumer-oriented interface,
              and a conscious decision to outshine the competition. In addition, Li recalls the ten
              months he spent micromanaging the engineering team to quickly turnaround the best
              quality technology the team could muster. He credits all of these early-term risks
              with the long-term sustainability of the enterprise.</p>

                  <p>What is it that American search companies have failed to understand in China? Baidu's
              CEO Li, Robin asserts numerous reasons that foreign-based search tools underestimated
              the growth of China's online content in the 1990's and early 2000's. He first points
              out that the capabilities of Google and Yahoo! overseas did not match China's
              tremendous scale of content growth. In addition, North American companies
              underestimated the fierce competition and entrepreneurial spirit of the Chinese. And
              many Internet companies coming to China did not plan for the long-term investment
              necessary to fully mesh with the market.</p>

                  <p>It's not a million dollar question. It's a trillion dollar question, says Li, Robin,
              CEO of Baidu, on the emergence of a Silicon Valley entrepreneurial ecosystem in China.
              Though the country's economy is enormous, much of it is based on cheap labor and
              inexpensive manufacturing. Many in China, particularly those in government, says Li,
              are very interested in developing the country's potential, but the task of replicating
              that kind of innovation has many roadblocks in its path. </p>

                  <p>A startup is not a "doll house" version of a larger enterprise. It's a human
              institution trying to start something new under extreme conditions of uncertainty,
              says author Ries, Eric. It's not that some founders have better ideas than others, and
              this is what dictates success. What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise
              is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find "the pivot"-
              the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling.
              And, more critically, that they can find their market before they run out of
              money.</p>

                  <p>After five years of product build-out and $40 million of capital, author Ries, Eric
              shares his personal story of monumental startup failure. The important distinction
              that he draws is not that his company failed to execute. To the contrary, all went
              strictly to plan, hiring the best talent, releasing a well-tested application, and
              garnering ample media and user attention. But the fledgling enterprise was a
              monumental disaster because of "shadow beliefs" - a uniformly-held series of ideas the
              company never discussed or articulated. Among them, they believed that they knew what
              customers wanted, they erroneously believed they could predict the future, and they
              took solace in the idea that plan advancement equals measurable progress. </p>

                  <p>After a very hi-profile startup failure, author Ries, Eric and other co-founders
              launched a second startup product in just six months - with technically hazardous
              results. Rather than investing the resources necessary to craft quality software, they
              decided to switch tactics and release a buggy version quickly to determine if the
              product could find a market. Ries found that early adopters - often more visionary
              than the company founders - were a huge asset in streamlining product development.
              Working with them from the very early stages allowed for a better-engineered product
              and broader mainstream market success. Ries offers suggestion on how to find these
              initial users; often through search engine marketing and Google AdWords, StumbleUpon
              campaigns, and creative Facebook ads. </p>

                  <p>Author and entrepreneur Ries, Eric unpacks the difference between waterfall and agile
              product development theories, and outlines when each are best employed. Waterfall -
              the linear path of product build-out - is best used when the problem and its solutions
              are well-understood. However, its hazard is that it can also lead to tremendous
              investment without guarantee of its success. Agile development, on the other hand, is
              a less-risky model of what can happen when the product changes with frequent user
              feedback and minimal waste. Without an authoritative solution clearly in sight, which
              is often the case of the startup, agile programming allows the growing enterprise to
              build-out quickly and correct itself often.</p>

                  <p>The largest source of waste in the startup, says author and entrepreneur Ries, Eric,
              is building a product that no one will find useful. This is not a technical error, but
              rather a tactical one. Find out early if your product has merit by developing two
              teams in-house: One that works on problems uncovering who the customer is and what
              problems they are trying to solve, and one that focuses solely on the solutions for
              the current product hypothesis.</p>

                  <p>Author and entrepreneur Ries, Eric stresses continuous deployment - that is, the
              updating of code and website changes as frequently as every twenty minutes - as a
              necessary asset to the functioning of a lean startup. He states that all online
              product development and engineering changes should be implemented slowly and with
              immediate testing for each small change. Working in small batches allows for the
              immediate catching of errors, quick team response, reduced implementation of
              resources, and more control and flexibility over the finished product. And along the
              way, human intervention also builds up the intelligence and capabilities of the
              in-house testing and deployment systems. Ries also offers specific applications and
              engineering functions to make continuous deployment possible.</p>

                  <p>In the successful build-out of a lean startup, entrepreneur and author Ries, Eric
              suggests adapting the rules of creating the minimum viable product. Rather than
              getting the product "right"; or employing the "release early, release often"
              philosophy of soliciting customer feedback for product development, the road to
              minimum viable product fuses the two ideas. The challenge for the startup is to figure
              out the smallest amount of product features and capabilities necessary for release,
              and then to slowly add more functionality as needed. For most entrepreneurs, says
              Ries, that means that any product will be about one-eigth as robust as they would like
              it to be. Ship it skinny, and add more features later - if your early adopter
              customers even notice what they're doing without. </p>

                  <p>As McDonough, William wrote in his book Cradle to Cradle, we should stop thinking of
              post-consumer goods as "waste", and instead start thinking of them as "food" in the
              product chain - upcycling raw materials and turning them into useful raw materials,
              rather than just alleviating the burden offset by recycling. Sun Microsystems' CTO
              Papadopoulos, Greg looks at this challenge from the perspective of engineering, and
              encourages the technical and scientific sectors to think not in terms of product
              degradation, but to look at manufacturing and design in terms of disassembly and
              endless reuse.</p>

                  <p>All of the smart people don't work for you. So how can an organization harness a
              broader intellect and get them to work on their projects? Keep your ideas free and
              accessible, and share them with anyone willing to participate. This kind of product
              innovation and reinvention creates community beyond the company walls, says
              Papadopoulos, Greg, CTO of Sun Microsystems, whether it's a devoted team of engineers
              or users. In the end, if a business is willing to allow others to have a hand in its
              technology and development, they will benefit from a finer finished product
              overall.</p>

                  <p>Using and understanding intellectual legal rights can be an asset to engineers, says
              former Sun Microsystems CTO Papadopoulos, Greg. In this clip, Papadopoulos explains
              the difference between patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and what each will allow
              for the inventor under the law. How they govern the laws of sharing intellectual
              property via open source can apply to any business model - from software code, to
              hi-end chocolate, to mechanically-engineered prosthetic limbs.</p>

                  <p>Failure is a very important part of the learning process in Silicon Valley, says
              Papadopoulos, Greg, CTO of Sun Microsystems. And people should disrupt themselves
              frequently and as inexpensively as possible. An organization not on its game will
              allow an upstart to dislodge their market foothold more easily or for less cost,
              thereby putting you out of business. Instead, the successful, stable enterprise will
              constantly question their own efforts and their own technologies and learn how to
              cannibalize their own actions. Papadopoulis cites as an example a recent Intel
              processor powering a fleet of netbooks. While they are taking market share away from
              their own flagship processors, it's better for Intel to usurp themselves, rather than
              to be crushed under a competitor's innovation.</p>

                  <p>Material science is the basis of all semiconductor technology, says former Intel
              Chairman of the Board Barrett, Craig. And during his 35-year stint with one of
              technology's most established firms, Barrett has learned that Moore's Law (Intel
              founder Gordon Moore's prediction that the number of transisters in an integrated
              circuit will double every 18 months) is still applicable now, 40 years after it was
              written. And though it will eventually have to change, it will likely remain relevant
              for another 15 years or more.</p>

                  <p>Intel was a marvel at technology and invention from its 1980's-era inception, recalls
              former Chairman of the Board and veteran company insider Barrett, Craig. But the
              company's strong suit was not manufacturing; in fact, they were often undersold on
              their own products by Japanese competitors. To improve their skills in this arena,
              Intel executives performed significant benchmarking of their overseas product
              producers, and a decade later they'd learned to standardize production across multiple
              factories.</p>

                  <p>You and your company don't own all of the smart engineers in the world. But how can
              one capitalize on that talent, asks Barrett, Craig, former Intel COB? Fund research
              and start-ups that compliment your own work, including university research, to unearth
              emerging talent and move the industry forward. Barrett discusses why Intel spends over
              six billion dollars on hundreds of companies every year outside of their own walls and
              the tremendous benefits that the practice reaps. Remember that a single bright idea
              from a small research team can bring a large corporation to its knees overnight. Says
              Barrett, "We don't want you eating our lunch."</p>

              discusses the change in his perspective; from garnering ROI, to offering
              sustainability, to building immortal "Internet treasures" - that is, the type of
              online utility that forever changes the world. He discusses the importance of thinking
              from the mountain top, and that the rest of the "distractions" - i.e. IPO's,
              acquisition, becoming a market leader, etc. - are just fool's gold.</p>

              KPCB. In this clip, Gordon and Zynga CEO Mark Pincus talk about how an effective CEO
              can make strategy and mission happen when they are not physicially present in the
              room. Pincus also discusses the importance of putting processes in place to
              communicate a larger vision, and why it's beneficial to write the story of your own
              goals and accomplishments. Keep control of your company and learn to negotiate only
              for the right things. Otherwise, you're just another employee. </p>

                  <p>If you can be a product manager, you can acquire the experience of acting as a CEO.
              The skills gained in product roadmapping, prioritizing tasks, interoffice
              communications, customer understanding, and product marketing are absolute necessities
              for being an effective enterprise lead. So says Mark Pincus, CEO and Founder of Zynga,
              who suggests this necessary on-the-job training for aspiring entrepreneurs. Be
              strategic. Take your times. Build yourself at world class companies before stretching
              your own ideas to task.</p>

                  <p>Pilots that fly by vision alone have a very short life expectancy when passing

              Pincus, CEO of game company Zynga, and Bing Gordon, partner at VC firm Kleiner Perkins
              Caufield &amp; Byers, touch upon the importance of metrics and analysis in social
              networking. In fact, Pincus states that one of his biggest career regrets from
              Tribe.net was not testing and measuring enough new tools and strategy. Gordan sums up
              the lesson for entrepreneurs by stating that we should, "believe in Darwinism, not
              Intelligent Design."</p>

                  <p>Mark Pincus, CEO and Founder of gaming company Zynga, encourages fast and frequent
              new ideas for video game development. But rather than putting forth tremendous
              resources to build out each idea, they company first tests its viability with a round
              of "ghetto testing" - five words that will be used to market the game, posted to the
              website live for five minutes. If sufficient audience interest is measured, then a
              one-week rollout of the first version of the game is revealed to just one percent of
              the Zynga audience for play and feedback, almost always with some modicum of "golden
              mechanics" - or viral, retentive quality - built in. If these early efforts prove
              successful, the game grows more robust with each successive build. Pincus reports that
              the company is always testing several hundred products simultaneously, and that
              measuring this success has never been easier or more affordable.</p>

                  <p>Waiting for the right deal, rather than the merchandizing deal at-hand, is a
              trade-off that artist/entrepreneur Chamillionaire is willing to wait for, with a keen
              eye toward authenticity at every turn. Quincy Jones III adds that a successful musical
              artist product roll-out requires thinking across multiple platforms and multiple
              media. Business models have changed in the digital age, and it's no longer the job of
              the artist to dictate. Instead, exploring the fan-base who appreciates your work for
              creative ideas like iPhone apps and logo design, using them as a sounding board for
              new music and visuals, and bringing them into the creative fold, have become a pivotal
              part of the modern music artist's marketing plan.</p>

              Blank, Steve outlines a host of reasons, including limited market opportunity, the
              expense of defining new markets, and the positioning risk involved in setting the
              market standard. Blank cautions that it may not be wise to be break new ground, and
              that safer terrain can be found in the footholds of the "first fast follower."</p>

                  <p>In this clip, the difference between vertical markets - niche players serving a
              specific need or customer set; and horizontal markets - goods or services that enable
              a platitude of businesses - are defined for the student of entrepreneurship. The needs
              of start-ups differ dramatically by vertical, says serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve.
              And taking advice from new enterprises in a different market niche can end in
              disaster. Take heed when receiving advice from friends in a neighboring business
              vertical. </p>

                  <p>Market risk is the concern that you'll find your customers before you run out of
              funding. A technical risk asks if the innovation is in place to bring your start-up
              idea to market successfully. Both of these concerns are paramount for an
              entrepreneurial venture, says serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve, and both have the
              potential to cause a young business to shutter. </p>

                  <p>Female Stanford students of entrepreneurship ask serial entrepreneur Blank, Steve:
              "How can one balance family life with the demands of the start-up?" Blank advises
              single people to stay single, and suggests that those with family ties set strict
              schedules to insure time together. Start-ups can easily take over one's life, he says,
              and one must be equally diligent in taking time off as working.</p>

                  <p>Whereas the 20th century belonged to the scientist, the 21st century, says Sun
              Micosystems' CTO Papadopoulos, Greg, is the domain of the engineer. Rather than
              secretly toiling away on new discoveries, modern engineers are concerned about social
              responsibility, renewable materials and product lifecycles, collaborative and open
              source discovery, and furthering industry-wide innovation.</p>

              building companies in different fields, the two offer the same central advice toward

                  <p>Acuray founder John Adler laughs and says his free-spirited son, Trip Adler, couldn't
              have done anything aside from becoming an entrepreneur. "Entrepreneurs have no rules,"
              he points out. One piece of advice he does give his son: Never give up the title of
              CEO. It's one of the hardest things to learn, he confesses. Trip Adler, CEO of Scribd,
              concurs. He explains that in many cases, it is the founder who is able to provide the
              vision to effectively direct product development.</p>

              continues, you just have to do it; you'll learn as you go. John Adler, founder of
              Accuray, agrees wholeheartedly, encouraging new entrepreneurs to resist feeling
              intimidated. Founding a company "calls for decision and bold action." While the lack
              of constraints and benchmarks can be daunting to the new entrepreneur, it also opens
              up great opportunities.</p>

                  <p>A surgeon and a CEO are nothing alike, observes Accuray founder John Adler. A
              surgeon, he explains, gives orders in the operating room; a CEO must persuade those in
              the boardroom to follow him. This difference in culture was a big surprise, recalls
              Adler, and took time to adjust to. Learning to persuade others is, in his view, a big
              part of the leadership process.</p>

                  <p>Given a choice between an MBA and a degree in a technical domain, which affords the
              best preparation for a entrepreneurial leadership role? Both Accuray's John Adler and
              Trip Adler of Scribd agree that for an entrepreneur planning to start a technology
              company, a degree in science or engineering provides the necessary edge for
              success.</p>

                  <p>Trust your vison, exclaims Accuray founder John Adler. In a lively discussion with
              his son and fellow entrepreneur Trip Adler of Scribd, the two expand on the idea that
              ultimately no one knows your company better than you.. Though there's no shortage of
              advice from those older and more experienced, both agree that trusting your instincts
              and making your own mistakes are vital parts of the learning process for a new
              entrepreneur.</p>

              While analytics data can provide helpful information, he cautions that if you listen

              appeal to a small niche market. Accuray founder John Adler agrees -- listen to your

              Chicago, says that planning is guessing, and for a start-up, the focus must be on

              otherwise--drive innovation and effective problem-solving. The most important thing,

                  <p>Unlearn Your MBA. It's the most important piece of advice new entrepreneurs can take,
              argues David Heinemeier Hansson. Hansson estimates that 96.7% of what he learned at
              the Copenhagen Business School has no impact on what he does today as a partner at
              37signals. MBA students need to readjust and recalibrate their thinking away from
              heavy management theories towards building a product and pleasing a customer.</p>

                  <p>Long-term planning, strategic planning, tactical planning -- all of these types of
              planning are really funny for a start-up, chuckles David Heinemeier Hansson, partner
              at 37signals. The punch line, he delivers, is that a start-up doesn't even know if it
              will be doing business in five years, let alone five months. These types of planning
              suit a stable business, like McDonald's in Northern Illinois. But a new business in a
              new industry has no clue what it will need long-term. In fact, he adds, most decisions
              for a start-up are incredibly temporary. What does matter more than planning? Simply
              starting.</p>

                  <p>David Heinemeier Hansson has a provocative point of view: he believes that Venture
              Capital is a time bomb and one of the most harmful things for a new business. He
              explains that a sudden windfall of money provides start-ups with a false sense of
              security. VC-injected companies often lose the urgency to create a sustainable,
              profitable product. These companies often become addicted to venture capital funding,
              requiring round after round of financing.</p>

                  <p>The key problem with venture capital remains simple: You're playing with other
              people's money. David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at 37signals, believes that using
              venture capital removes the accountability that's inherent when an entrepreneurs use
              their own money. When it's your own money, he continues, you want to make more of it
              faster, so you don't just put out a product without a price. The urgency you get from
              spending and making your own money is the most powerful driving force for an
              entrepreneur.</p>

                  <p>Skewed expectations present a major risk when accepting venture capital. Most venture
              capitalists expect to make a lot of money, and they expect the company they help to
              become billion-dollar ventures. David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at 37signals,
              compares this type of risk to putting all of your money on red five in a game of
              roulette. When you build a business that earns a million dollars per year, you're
              taking a more calculated risk, analogous to that of a skilled poker player who
              steadily builds up his winnings. "The fact of the matter is that a million dollars is
              a lot of money when it goes straight into your bank account," asserts Heinemeier
              Hansson, partner at 37signals.</p>

                  <p>Being a workaholic is no guarantee of success. David Heinemeier Hansson points out
              that 37signals' main product, Basecamp, was created on 10 hours a week of development
              for a total of six months. When you're overworked, you can't think creatively. A great
              idea comes from a well-rested mind.</p>

                  <p>David Heinemeier Hansson reminds the audience of a simple fact: you'll never outdo
              Microsoft or Google; they will always have more resources than start-ups. But an
              entrepreneur must realize that constraints are your friend. Having some limitations
              will force you to think differently than your competition.</p>

                  <p>Nobody is an overnight success, claims David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at 37signals
              and developer of the Web platform Ruby on Rails. When some product or company suddenly
              appears out of nowhere, it usually arrives out of 10 years worth of work. He points
              out that 37signals and Basecamp took just this length of time to become a success.
              Accelerated growth is a charade, Heinemeier Hansson stresses. It takes time to develop
              a sustainable, profitable company.</p>

                  <p>Asked to clarify the difference between a small business and a scalable business that
              hopes to earn a billion dollars, David Heinemeier Hansson, partner at 37signals, says
              they are the same thing. Scalable for Heinemeier Hansson means there isn't a direct
              correlation between profit and employee count: I can earn 5 million dollars and not
              hire five people. Many large companies give the impressions that that there is a
              connection -- i.e., for every $500,000 earned, a company must hire two people -- so
              smaller companies wrongly focus on organizational charts and meetings. He points out
              that 37signals is both a small business (15 employees) and a highly profitable
              company.</p>

                  <p>A startup, David Heinemeier Hansson argues, will never have the resources to outspend
              a Google or a Microsoft in promoting itself. Instead, his own company 37signals tries
              to out-teach. "We're trying to build an audience; we're not just trying to have
              customers." Through blogs, lectures, seminars and other teachable moments, he explains
              that 37signals has created a following of the company that may not use the product
              today. But at some point, these people will either buy our product or recommend it to
              someone who will. In the end, all sustainable businesses are built by word of
              mouth.</p>

              school? Buy for $1, sell for $2. While it may seem like a simple idea, some of the
              most basic lessons are the most difficult to understand. For him, these lessons have
              helped him better understand capitalism. Through this clarification, he has realized

              job or product.</p>

              are in balance, an entrepreneur can achieve success like that of AOL; when they

                  <p>Don't set sail without thinking first: this sage advice sums up risk analysis for
              Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell, department chair of Management Science and Engineering at
              Stanford University. She explains that risk assessment involves the study of
              scenarios, probabilities, and consequences. A risk analyst uses logic and statistics
              to makes sense of uncertainties and provides possible solutions to derail disaster.
              While some events force quick thinking, most can be avoided with a little forethought.
              After all, she simplifies: risk analysis isn't just nuclear reactors, it's also real
              life.</p>

                  <p>Six young Stanford grads and entrepreneurs -- Steven Garrity, Clara Shih, Kimber
              Lockhart, Jeff Seibert, Josh Reeves, and Tristan Harris -- share their experiences
              starting companies and raising capital. While being in their 20s may seem to be an
              obstacle to outsiders, they said they "flipped" this liability into an asset --
              focusing instead on their raw ability to bring innovative ideas to life. They advise
              all young entrepreneurs to be persistent, opportunistic, and scrappy.</p>

                  <p>Jonathan Boutelle and Rashmi Sinha, founders of the presentation-sharing site
              SlideShare, describe the entrepreneurial process as a series of pivots. Boutelle
              explains it's not just a jump, but an evolving growth of stages that leads to an idea
              that can start a business. From there, Sinha says that focused execution keeps the
              vision moving forward. By continually measuring the activity, they both believe that
              entrepreneurs can better recognize the growth stages of their company.</p>

                  <p>Accenture's Liz Tinkham interviews salesforce.com's Polly Sumner about
              entrepreneurship that occurs in both large and small companies. They both agree that
              innovation and risk-taking occur in any-sized company where the culture emphasizes "no
              idea is a dumb idea." Sumner advises young entrepreneurs to not fear risk: every
              failure teaches you a valuable lesson, and once learned, success is that much
              sweeter.</p>

                  <p>In a world of uncertainties, you seldom have statistics, explains Dr. M. Elisabeth
              PatÚ-Cornell, department chair of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford
              University. Risk analysis examines a broad distribution of outcomes based on scenarios
              and their probable consequences. From these results, she says a people must decide if
              they can live with the hypothesized outcomes. If not, we must decide how to best
              allocate resources for reinforcement of the systems in place to avoid disaster.</p>

                  <p>Real risks of real life don't always involve airplanes and nuclear power plants. Dr.
              M. Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell shares a personal example: She has a two-year-old little boy
              who likes to tumble down the stairs in her new home. If that doesn't sound dangerous
              enough, the landing also has a sharp post. Dr. PatÚ-Cornell uses risk analysis to
              calculate the number of times her son might tumble down the stairs, the accident rate
              and possible solutions. The result: She builds a bumper of three baskets that can
              absorb the force of a basketball without breaking.</p>

                  <p>How does someone think about risk analysis? Management Science and Engineering
              department chair Dr. Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell breaks down the process of assessing risk:
              She first speaks with experts to find out how a given system works and how it might
              fail; then she examines ways of reinforcing a system. A risk analyst can only provide
              options based on available resources; they cannot make decisions for someone.</p>

                  <p>System analysis stands in the center of most risk analysis. Deconstructing the
              system, one breaks it down into classes of scenarios that can allow an analyst to
              better understand how something can fail. The two biggest classes are dependencies on
              external factors and human error. Dr. Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell, department chair of
              Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, explains that you look at
              these types of scenarios because there are not enough reliable statistics.</p>

                  <p>The classic example of an accident that hasn't happened yet: the heating tiles of the
              space shuttle. The first 33 flights consisted of errors in maintenance. Dr. Elisabeth
              PatÚ-Cornell describes how she discovered that technicians were mixing water with the
              glue, so the heating would adhere faster to the surface; though, by diluting the
              contacting bond, it put the heating tiles more at risk during the space shuttle's
              reentry into Earth. Her team created a map of the space shuttle and the most crucial
              heating tiles. In the end, she made recommendations based upon the data and
              research.</p>

                  <p>The patient risk in anesthesia highlights the dynamics of accidents. The problem: How
              can the management of anesthesia systems be improved to decrease patient risks that
              could occur in the operating room environment? To compute the probability of an
              accident of all scenarios, a dynamic model helps to understand how fast things could
              go wrong once an accident first occurred and how fast someone must react to resolve
              the problem. Among the contributing factors causing an accident (work schedule,
              training, and experience), Dr. Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell, department chair of Management
              Science and Engineering at Stanford University, says that simulated training helped
              decrease accidents by an optimistic 16 percent.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Elisabeth PatÚ-Cornell, department chair of Management Science and Engineering at
              Stanford University, wonders aloud whether entrepreneurs actually take that much risk.
              She explains that in the United States, venture capitalists take a lot of calculated
              risk by backing budding start-ups, while in Europe, bankers, acting in the same role,
              are not. Entrepreneurs usually start with a technical idea for a company and surround
              themselves with a great team of managers and technicians. Indeed, the success of
              risk-taking boils down to a single factor: the ability to build teams and cultivate
              many skills.</p>

                  <p>Ten years into his career, Hagstrom, William, CEO of Crescendo Bioscience, says he
              had an epiphany. Working at a billion-dollar company, he remembers leaving a lateral
              meeting when a colleague approached him and told him to "relax, it's only a job, it's
              not a crusade." And this comment hit him like a ton of bricks: if he was going to
              invest his life and time into a venture, it better be a crusade.</p>

                  <p>Crescendo Bioscience CEO Hagstrom, William explains some of the biggest lessons he
              learned from the early stages of his career. Taking initiative, doing fieldwork, and
              being objective rank as some of the most useful things he learned while working for
              large, multinational healthcare firms like Baxter International. What was the most
              important lesson? Tenacity and relentlessness make all the difference in whether a
              project succeeds or fails.</p>

                  <p>Hagstrom, William, CEO of Crescendo Bioscience, remembers an idea from a column in
              Inc. magazine: "There comes a time when you realize the business needs something you
              can't give it; at the same time, you realize you need something the business can't
              give you," A CEO needs to know there are very distinct life cycles in a company's
              evolution, and business leaders must constantly assess their role and place in these
              maturation stages as well as their own needs as entrepreneurs.</p>

                  <p>From his first experiences as an entrepreneur, Hagstrom, William, CEO of Crescendo
              Bioscience, relates the importance of strategy and its integration into the business
              model. Added to this vision, he believes a CEO of a healthcare firm must have a
              thorough knowledge and understanding of the technical and scientific aspects
              pertaining to the business. Because there is little margin for error, the company
              leader must also be a multitasking dynamo with sound judgment who can deliver results.
              In short, the CEO must do more than talk, he must act.</p>

                  <p>A few companies into his entrepreneurial life, Hagstrom, William, CEO of Crescendo
              Bioscience, has some advice for those who are just starting out. An entrepreneur must
              think about and understand risk better, so he can ultimately minimize it. He boils the
              many insights into some hard-learned lessons: architect the business more deeply and
              muscle it with talent, so the programs are stouter and the company makes a bigger
              impact. And while it may seem obvious, he says that a CEO must build in time to think
              and reflect about what's going on in the business.</p>

                  <p>To bootstrap means to use revenue or personal savings to run your operations,
              explains Josh Reeves, founder of unwrapped inc. Rather than seeking out venture
              capital, Reeves explains why bootstrapping his own venture allowed him to tinker with
              his company's product and vision without worrying about the reactions of outside
              investors. Hearsay Labs Co-Founders Clara Shih and Steve Garrity agree, saying they
              only sought venture capital to push their company to the next level in product
              development and to satisfy their customers' needs.</p>

                  <p>A VC firm would provide a bit more name recognition," says Jeff Seibert, founder of
              Increo Solutions, Inc. Just out of college, he believes it provided him and his
              partner Kimber Lockhart with a lot more credibility to the companies they wanted to
              sell their product. Tristan Harris, founder of Apture, relates how they first earned
              angel capital, then used the name recognition to gain their first customers, which
              then led to the company's series A round of funding.</p>

                  <p>What are the biggest obstacles and assets for young entrepreneurs? Unwrapped, inc.
              founder Josh Reeves answers that the biggest obstacle it not knowing how to manage all
              the priorities. Clara Shih, founder of Hearsay Labs, believes that being a young
              entrepreneur has its advantages because you can highlight your ability to solve
              problems from a fresh perspective. Steve Garrity, of Hearsay Labs, says that youth
              allows you to ask lots of seemingly naive questions. Plus, Increo Solutions, Inc.
              founder Kimber Lockhart adds that starting a business is challenging for everyone, not
              just young entrepreneurs. Don't assume that older, first time entrepreneurs have all
              the answers.</p>

                  <p>Having an engineering degree, says Jeff Seibert, founder of Increo Solutions, Inc.,
              allows you to prototype your own idea. "You don't have to choose" between an
              engineering degree and an economics one, quips Clara Shih, founder of Hearsay Labs.
              Having a nontechnical degree allows you to better explain complex technical issues in

              build a specific customer profile then find out where they hangout online. Summing it
              up, the underlying philosophy in getting customers, explains Josh Reeves, founder of
              unwrapped, inc., is to be scrappy, opportunistic and have a strategy in getting that
              customer. When you're at a coffee shop, bring up your company. "You never know where
              that conversation will lead."</p>

                  <p>A media company on the Internet requires a lot of traffic to make it worth the time
              to make large-scale brand advertising happen, explains SlideShare CTO Jonathan
              Boutelle. His cofounder Rashmi Sinha said it's important for a Web site to make clear
              to their users how they intend to generate revenue and whether it's going to be
              through ads. Even when the site first launched, she continued, they have always had
              advertising. Sinha describes it as making a pact early on with their users that
              SlideShare will be an ad-driven service that they can use for free.</p>

              SlideShare, explains that the company developed in stages: SlideShare got to the point
              where it could no longer just grow organically and needed outside funding. "Your first
              investor [is] possibly your lawyer," interjects Jonathan Boutelle, Sinha's cofounder
              at SlideShare. He describes the process of an outside entrepreneur trying to navigate
              the world of Silicon Valley like peeling through the layers of an onion: first, there
              are the lawyers and advisers; then angel investors; and in the center, venture
              capitalists.</p>

              CEO Rashmi Sinha. But the only thing she does know, she continues, is how to learn,

              by the moderator, she emphasizes how important it is to ask questions and have good
              advisers. Good advisers "are able to spot the signals and see the patterns," she says,
              adding that a good adviser sees what stage your company is in just by hearing about
              the issues you're seeing. "It gets down to the whole Silicon Valley magic again,"
              summarizes Jonathan Boutelle, cofounder of SlideShare - this is a community full of
              experienced entrepreneurs from whom you can ask for advice.</p>

                  <p>Is SlideShare about strategy or execution? "It's about both," answers Rashmi Sinha,
              cofounder of the presentation-sharing Web site. It surprises her how important
              execution is to the process. In Silicon Valley, she explains, there are a lot of smart
              people with good ideas who aren't persistent enough to make their vision come alive.
              CTO Jonathan Boutelle chimes in that one of the biggest engineering challenges to
              execute was the raw scaling of the site to handle nearly 25 million monthly visitors.
              Returning to the original question, he adds that good execution should drive
              strategy.</p>

                  <p>Execution-wise, SlideShare founder Rashmi Sinha believes that one of the most
              difficult tasks is getting people to stay focused on the problem. "It's exciting to
              build new features, but harder to make it work day in and day out." To do this, she
              explains that we identify the most important aspects of critical products on a daily
              basis, constantly reassessing the various frequencies and metrics of the site and
              business. Jonathan Boutelle stresses the importance of making these numbers easily
              understood and accessible for each employee of the company.</p>

                  <p>Getting into entrepreneurship isn't a jump, asserts SlideShare CTO Jonathan Boutelle,
              it's a pivot, and more often than not, a series of pivots. He adds that if the first
              thing you do isn't your dream product or service but it gets money from customers,
              you're already headed in the right direction as an entrepreneur. And what motivates an
              entrepreneur? His cofounder Rashmi Sinha says that for herself, it's the ability to be
              independent and to always be facing a new challenge.</p>

                  <p>Innovation, risk-taking and entrepreneurship are critical to getting the economy back
              on track, pronounces Case, Steve, former CEO and chairman of AOL. While the government
              is doing what it can, it requires the private sector - and entrepreneurs - to take
              risks to help keep the American economy robust. For success in entrepreneurship, Case
              believes it requires the three P's: people, passion and perseverance.</p>

                  <p>How did the AOL-Time Warner merger become the worst merger in history? Case, Steve,
              former CEO and chairman of America Online, says that while the dot.com bubble bursting
              may have added to demise of the venture, he believes that the core reason goes back to
              the three P's: there was a culture clash between the two companies; the passion that
              pushed AOL forward diminished; and people wanted a quick fix to profit loss and didn't
              persevere.</p>

                  <p>Looking back on his first 20 years with AOL, Case, Steve reflects that he really
              thrived on the innovation of his first startup. His next project, Revolution, invests
              in people and ideas that change the world, which is the same mission of his
              philanthropic organization, the Case Foundation. Too many entrepreneurs, he believes,
              have a "built-to-flip mentality, as opposed to a built-to-last,
              built-to-change-the-world mentality." He says that the Internet has become a lot like
              the entertainment industry: it's easy to produce a movie but hard to build and sustain
              an audience.</p>

                  <p>Case, Steve sums up his career as an entrepreneur: the creation of AOL, the failed
              merger, the resurgence with Revolution. Entrepreneurship fuels the economy with the
              risk-taking attitudes on business and innovation that can change the world. He adds
              that the recession may open the door for what may be the "golden era of
              entrepreneurship": the big companies are being defensive and leaving an opportunity
              for a bold entrepreneur to swing for the fences. With his own company Revolution, he
              keeps an eye out for the next great idea fueled by the passion and perseverance of the
              right people.</p>

                  <p>Luck is important, but perseverance really does matter. Case, Steve, former CEO and
              chairman of AOL, explains that in the 1990s, AOL seemed like an overnight sensation,
              coming out of nowhere. "We were a 10-year-in-the-making overnight sensation," he
              quips. There were a lot of ups and downs before AOL became one of the hottest
              companies in the country, he says. His own experience really emphasizes a crucial
              point: if you really believe in the idea, figure out a way to stay in the game.</p>

                  <p>Polly Sumner, chief adoption officer at salesforce.com, observes that
              entrepreneurship thrives in companies where people believe "no idea is a dumb idea."
              It's something important to her, and she advises anyone interviewing for a job to
              check out whether the company is interested in new ideas. "I never interview a
              person... without asking," she says, "?What's an idea you've had that you think could
              work here?'" If you look at entrepreneurs who receive venture capital money, she
              believes that you'll see people who are not afraid of taking a risk on an idea.</p>

                  <p>For Polly Sumner, recovering from failure is a lesson that you first learn as a
              child. She says that playing sports as an adolescent stresses the important fact that
              when you lose a game, you need to get back and play harder. "When you fail the first
              time and win the second time, the win is much sweeter," says Sumner.</p>

              salesforce.com. When you make things simple, she says people will use them. "Look at
              the iPhone," she says, pointing out the relationship between innovation and simplicity
              in the tech industry. Accenture's Liz Tinkham adds that this simplicity becomes even
              more important when writing a solid business proposal. The idea needs to be
              communicated concisely to have any success, she says.</p>

                  <p>The problem most startups have when they take their product or service to the big
              companies? "The big companies can't figure out how to make it mundane enough to
              interoperate with all of the complexity they have," answers Liz Tinkham, a global
              manager at Accenture. She says that a start-up may have the best piece of new
              technology ever, but if it doesn't work easily with other technology, it's just too
              hard to get larger companies to adopt the service or product.</p>

                  <p>The size difference between a large company and a startup didn't faze her, says
              salesforce.com?s Polly Sumner, the biggest challenge as a CEO of a start-up was
              learning how lead all departments of a company (i.e., marketing, product development)
              towards a single target. To do so, she believes it first requires a period of
              self-assessment for the CEO to realize how through what type of lens they use to
              examine problems. Once they understand their "DNA make-up," they can build a team that
              complements their skill sets and broadens their vision. "In entrepreneurialism, you
              need to remember to keep your lens wider," Sumner stresses.</p>

                  <p>Because they can make the dog jump, [entrepreneurs] somehow assume that everyone
              wants a jumping dog, says KPCB partner Komisar, Randy. His point? Too often, start-ups
              launch a solution without thinking through the problem that it solves. Without
              necessitating spending a nickel, an entrepreneur's first step should be plotting how
              the market has evolved to allow for a next-step product or service. As an example, he
              cites Apple's launch of the iPod on the backs of the Sony Walkman and Napster. Nothing
              is unique or truly inventive, says Komisar. The trick is finding the worn path that
              will allow your venture to dig in its heels.</p>

                  <p>Don't avoid taking a leap of faith, says partner at KPCB Komisar, Randy, but be
              certain to correctly define it. What's key in successfully making the jump is that it
              prioritizes three questions you're forced to answer, providing extreme market and
              product focus. The result will either flatten your idea or make your business
              soar.</p>

                  <p>Komisar, Randy, a partner with VC firm KPCB, opines on the most recent trends for
              investment as of Spring of 2010. He points out that the consumer internet is a
              difficult business to gauge, and gives that sector a yellow light. However, he gives a
              green light to green and sustainable ventures, noting that they have the potential to
              build a tremendous asset in legacy businesses. Komisar is also a fan of substantial
              and "unsexy" tools for consumers, such as patents and home equity protection
              applications, as they, too, are a large growth area currently attractive to the VC
              set.</p>

                  <p>Innovation is not a monopoly of Silicon Valley, says venture capitalist Komisar,
              Randy. But entrepreneurship as a profession, he notes, is practiced best on KPCB's
              home turf. Here, failure isn't personal, and it is tolerated for approximately 70
              percent of the businesses that launch here. The Valley offers a unique understanding
              that Plan A is often flawed and that failure is a necessity for true innovation, and
              thus it offers the space for smart and inventive people to reassess and move on to the
              next venture. This key difference that has evolved over the past 70 years, says
              Komisar, is what has made Silicon Valley thrive.</p>

                  <p>In conversation with Stanford's Seelig, Tina, KPCB's Komisar, Randy points out that
              while customer feedback is a good idea, it should not be the de facto driver for
              products and solutions. Too often, consumers miss the mark on inventions (such as
              ATM's and mobile phones) because they can't conceive that they would ever need them.
              The smart entrepreneur, says Komisar, asks questions to determine if there is a market
              need, rather than testing a first-to-market product itself.</p>

                  <p>The early days of the Web were focused around email and one-on-one communication. The
              Web then evolved into a valuable resource for information. Later, it became a media
              hub, and today it runs on social networking powered by people. In this thoughtful
              clip, KPCB's Komisar, Randy ponders not only the evolution of Internet content and the
              types of businesses that it spurs, but questions the Web's next great phase. In his
              crystal ball, tools that help users make sense of the myriad content available - and
              tools that help alleviate our need to pay attention - will be the next almighty
              miracle of digital life.</p>

              Brown touches upon his theory of a monumental economic shift from a push to a pull

              used to be guaranteed longevity if they made it into the S&amp;P 500, nowadays many
              survive there only five or ten years. The 21st century is qualitatively different,
              says Seely Brown, with new technological institutional mechanisms forcing new business
              practices.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneurship isn't just a sport; it's extreme. Brown, John Seely, Deloitte Center
              for the Edge's Independent Co-Chairman, paid attention when suddenly five of the
              globe's top aerial surfers originated from the same place. Why the sudden regional
              success? Though fierce competitors, they all knew one another and collectively
              benchmarked from other surfers. They recorded and studied one another's achievements
              and flaws, and appropriated ideas from adjacent verticals, such as skateboarding,
              mountain biking, etc. Collectively, they improved their personal performance, and
              simultaneously built up the ecosystem en masse. Seely Brown points out these
              passion-fueled tactics and suggests that entrepreneurs use this model to expand their
              personal performance and build success to benefit their business community.</p>

                  <p>Success is based on more than just luck. By choosing the right kind of environment
              and cultivating the practices that will help find new ideas, one can take inspiration
              from unlikely sources. Furthermore, deep listening with reciprocity - meaning not only
              digging for good ideas from others, but offering them back in return - is a valuable
              skill to nurture. Brown, John Seely, Independent Co-Chairman of Deloitte Center for

              cites an example of one man who travels to a far-flung conference every year simply to
              strategize and learn to think outside his comfort zone. Taking an interest in energy
              (a field outside his own), he created programs and legislation that yielded effective
              results.</p>

              says Miox CEO Perea, Carlos. What's an entrepreneur to do? Ideally, find a way to
              clean and reuse the global water supply that's, "twice as good at half the cost" of
              conventional chlorine decontamination. In this lecture, Perea demonstrates his

                  <p>Can entrepreneurs be made? This question is incredibly important for aspiring
              entrepreneurs, investors, and educational organizations like BASES. For some, the
              answer is straightforward; if you inherently possess a certain set of qualities, then,
              at the very least, you have the potential to become a successful entrepreneur.
              Otherwise, you're out of luck. For others, there is a relatively distinct manner in
              which entrepreneurs can be developed, through both intentional circumstances and
              otherwise, such as family background and education.</p>

                  <p>Improved safety and water quality aren't the only results of displacing chlorine as a
              water purifier. Perea, Carlos, Miox CEO, points out that saving money is the main
              reason that his private and municipal customers utilize his company's water treatment
              capabilities. He states that Miox's focus is always on driving costs down, because
              without this edge - no matter how honorable a clean tech innovation - a disruptive
              technology cannot ever achieve real market dominance. If an innovation in power or
              natural resources isn't going to be subsidized or regulated, it still must abide by
              the structure of the free market, and its relative cost is imperative for its
              success.</p>

              CEO of Miox Perea, Carlos, and the field of clean tech is extremely attractive because
              of it. Entrepreneurs working to solve problems in power and water have the capability
              to be truly effectual on a massive scale - and thus the payback on this investment has
              the potential to be enormous.</p>

                  <p>Miox CEO Perea, Carlos was able to lure top talent to his venture by allowing the
              product to sell itself. He shares an anecdote about how his employee learned
              first-hand the power and impact of clean drinking water while on a trip to Honduras,
              and how this urged him to leave his career in solar power to help further Miox's
              goals. This desire to push helpful technologies forward can be a potent carrot and
              stick, Perea points out, and one that can't be ignored when trying to build a clean
              tech team.</p>

                  <p>Emerging technologies in the field of energy have the potential for tremendous pay
              out. But the flip side of that equation also means that some ventures require
              substantial investment to launch. Miox CEO Perea, Carlos offers an interesting
              industry perspective on the state of venture funding in clean technologies. In this
              clip, he comments on VC's current savvy in sharing investment risk with other
              companies and government agencies. He also notes the investment community's improved
              intelligence navigating through government regulation, as well as other learned
              strategies.</p>

                  <p>With over 50 million listeners, Pandora is easily one of the most popular online
              music vehicles. But as compared to the entire mass radio spectrum, Pandora remains a
              mere blip on the airwaves. CTO Conrad, Tom states that a key strategy in remaining
              focused comes from the metrics enterprises choose to surround themselves with. He
              suggests that start-ups find the numbers and the facts that make them feel small as a
              tactic to keep them steadily growing.</p>

                  <p>How does strategic corporate investment differ from typical venture capital
              investment? And how does this affect the types of deals transacted? Lambert, Lisa,
              Vice President of Intel Capital, offers examples of the structural differences typical
              of Intel's investing arm, including larger dollars to create a broader impact. In
              addition, Intel Capital deals are often accompanied by a prefabricated business
              agreement to seal the deal.</p>

                  <p>Intel Capital VP Lambert, Lisa discusses a sea change in the investment community as
              of Spring, 2010. While VC's were formerly more attracted to solely investing in
              start-ups, she states that her firm has grown more stage-agnostic. Quick returns more
              often hinge on later-stage enterprises than on business concepts fresh out of the
              gate. In addition, she reports that Intel Capital has very few plans for acquisition
              of these firms, estimating that the company takes over less than one percent of those
              they financially back.</p>

                  <p>Why take on financial risk alone? Intel Capital, says Vice President Lambert, Lisa,
              most often invests in combination with their network of about two dozen other
              investment entities. While they have a number of deals that they've embarked upon
              independently, overall the company prefers to work in syndication with these other
              top-tier houses - and the partnership reaps rewards for all. Her firm benefits by a
              deeper purse of dollars to bring to market, and the other venture capital firms share
              in the access that comes from Intel's broad reach of over one hundred investors in 47
              countries. </p>

                  <p>Lambert, Lisa, Intel Capital's Vice President, points out that despite what other
              independently-run VC firms say, their corporate investing arm can offer the companies
              in their investment portfolio a lot more than just dollars. Good VC's also open up
              their circle of contacts and offer useful advice along the path. In this clip, Lambert
              speaks at length about the matchmaking conferences that Intel organizes for its

                  <p>The VC industry is suffering from a severe lack of liquidity, says Intel Capital's
              Vice President Lambert, Lisa. Lambert offers her analysis on the current shape of the
              investment community - and finds much room for improvement. As an asset class, she
              anticipates a lot of consolidation in the industry as a whole; offering growing pains
              at the moment, but providing a healthier market overall.</p>

                  <p>Reflecting back on her driven career success, Intel Capital VP Lambert, Lisa speaks
              of her abundant dedication to her work, and how that functions within her current
              desire to have a family. Her advice to college grads, particularly young women, is not
              to let their career drive overshadow the other aspects of their life, but instead to
              acknowledge and prioritize what's most important. Lambert suggests planting the seeds
              of family preparation early on in one's career, else, "You're vice-president of the
              company, and there's not a lot of options for you."</p>

                  <p>Is an operations background a mandatory prerequisite for running a start-up? Not
              necessarily, but it helps, says serial entrepreneur Andreessen, Marc. While nearly
              anyone with any experience can manage a successful enterprise, it helps to have had
              hands-on experience in the event of layoffs, restructuring, and the like.</p>

              successful start-up. He states that there must be a substantial market opportunity, a
              product that's a 10x better solution, and an outstanding team. Andreessen goes on to
              state that there can be some compromise in the product area, but that the other two
              legs of a burgeoning business must stand firm.</p>

                  <p>Many of the most successful technology enterprises were launched as products,
              observes Andreessen, Marc, serial entrepreneur, including Facebook, Twitter, and
              others. He states that tools created this way are based purely on market demand,
              making these applications much more compelling. To the contrary, companies that
              establish themselves first and then work to craft an application have their
              achievements, but they are more likely to plummet into failure. Entrepreneurs
              approaching from this angle can too often fool themselves into believing they have a
              tool of value.</p>

              electronics are hot and viable in Silicon Valley once again. He argues that many of
              the devices in this most recent wave utilize existing chips and applications, but the
              market innovation comes from repackaging the technology with value-added software and
              services. He and his investors are very excited by the current state of

                  <p>Successful user-generated Web plays "tend to harness peoples' passions, rather than
              harness peoples' greed," says serial entrepreneur Andreessen, Marc. He points out that
              any user-centric Web vehicle that has tried to share revenue with its
              content-producing audience has failed - and spectacularly. It's not money that
              motivates people to share their ideas and opinions, says Andreessen. The platform for
              sharing one's own personal expression is its own reward.</p>

                  <p>The "venture capital industry" does not exist, says serial entrepreneur Andreessen,
              Marc. Rather, the landscape is a loosely-affiliated network of over 600 investment
              organizations, with only about 30 firms performing well and returning profit overall.
              In parallel, there is a rise in seed funding for new ventures and a rise in
              latter-stage investing for established companies as well.</p>

                  <p>The best entrepreneurs know how to talk about and sell their company, and the way
              they define their enterprise can often be a polarizing sport. Essentially, propelling
              a young company - either to investors or to talent - is a sales job, and one that a
              company founder must find compelling. Andreessen, Marc, serial entrepreneur, speaks at
              length about the necessity of a founder to define their company and to establish early
              on what it is, and what it is not.</p>

                  <p>True innovations are not about a mad scientist in a laboratory. Rather, says Makower,
              Josh, CEO of ExploraMed, innovation is a learned skill, and we can all be taught to be
              creative and productive. By learning the discipline that propels innovation, people
              can acquire the knowledge to develop their skills and become well-versed in the

                  <p>In the field of innovation, decide what you want the end result to be before you
              invent it, advises ExploraMed CEO Makower, Josh. In addition, he advises a disciplined
              approach toward innovation that focuses on living inside of a problem to understand it
              to exhaustion. The end result, he asserts, is that entrepreneurs can focus more
              directly on producing results of value, rather than simply falling in love with a
              single idea.</p>

              technology and creative thinking as an effective way to engage the public in serving
              itself. He shares the success of a mobile texting protocol that raised over $30
              million for relief from the earthquake in Haiti, and an upcoming text messaging
              program that allows citizens to anonymously report crimes in Mexico's most violent
              cities. </p>

                  <p>Time is money, says the old adage. And here, Senior Advisor for Innovation in the
              Office of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Ross, Alec advises would-be entrepreneurs
              to manage and allocate their schedule as carefully and as thoughtfully as they manage
              and allocate their dollars. After struggling with this life lesson for eight years,
              and reflecting on his personal calendar's hefty wasted time, he suggest being
              exceedingly ruthless about the resources of hours and days.</p>

              Ross, Alec offers advice to established entrepreneurs who already have some success
              behind them: Keep an open line of communication going with those up and coming in your
              field. While many successful people feel they have a lot to offer their juniors, few
              take advantage of the relationship working as a learning experience both ways. Don't
              allow your success to become isolating. Remaining au courant is a great indicator of
              recurring prosperity.</p>

              can foster the development of these ties between science and business by offering

              discusses mirroring the diversity of ideas and workforce that exists in Silicon

              nation's work visa and immigration policies, Minister Fontaine also articulates a
              number of incentives Chile offers to emerging businesses. These incentives include low
              operating costs, open trade, and a well-established trade relationship with Asia.</p>

                  <p>Economic Minister Fontaine outlines details of Chile's grant-making and business
              magnet program, Start-Up Chile. The program offers a $40,000 grant to entrepreneurs
              bringing early-stage businesses to the country for a minimum of six months. Grant
              winners must interact with the Chilean people and maintain ties with the country, even
              if the company relocates to foreign soil. Fontaine explains this is a pilot program
              which the government hopes will help to spark a culture of innovation.</p>

                  <p>Chilean science professors are not used to thinking in terms of startups, says
              Fontaine, Juan AndrÚs, Chile's Minister of Economy, Development and Tourism. However,
              through partnerships with Stanford University and other organizations, business
              development education is growing in Chile's universities. Minister Fontaine expresses
              the desire for students to take risks and learn to solve problems using an
              entrepreneurial frame of mind. </p>

                  <p>Chatterjee, Amit, CEO and founder of Hara, discusses the learning benefits an
              entrepreneur gains from "putting on a suit" inside a larger company. Compared to
              launching his own entrepreneurial ventures, Chatterjee found working within an
              established enterprise to be a way to gain experience in strategy and critical
              thinking - without having to worry about the bottom line. Ironically, it was also
              through contacts made while working in a Fortune 5000 that Chatterjee became inspired
              to launch his next startup.</p>

                  <p>Hara CEO Chatterjee, Amit sees the fertile breeding ground for his venture at the
              intersection of info-tech and green tech. Even with a solid idea and a unique concept,
              his company decided to quietly accept venture capital and gain market traction in
              stealth mode for the first 18 months. The benefit of this concept, says Chatterjee, is
              that it kept the company focused on product development, rather than marketing and
              posturing.</p>

                  <p>When you know that some players on your team are not a good fit, let them go quickly,
              says Hara CEO Chatterjee, Amit. In his estimate, one-third of your employees will be
              passionate devotees, one-third will be willing to follow, and the remaining third will
              voice their discontent. Members of that last group must change or move on.</p>

                  <p>Don't build a company to flip it; build it to last, says Chatterjee, Amit, CEO and
              Founder of Hara. His preferred method for startup financing is to initially take
              venture funding, and then to take the company public. While a startup can take
              additional rounds of funding, Chatterjee believes going public is a less trade-off
              intensive way to finance a high-growth global enterprise.</p>

              hire people that you can learn from; 3) Focus on creating value, rather than simply

                  <p>Dan Rosensweig, former COO of Yahoo! and current CEO of Chegg, speaks about the value
              of acquisitions for organizations who face operational pressures that can inhibit
              internal invention. Yahoo! bought other companies for either their team or their
              technology, but the ultimate goal of any acquisition on their radar was to use it as a
              magnet for broader advertising sales. </p>

                  <p>A billion dollars were on the table, but still Facebook refused to sell itself to
              Yahoo!. In this clip, Yahoo!'s then COO (and current Chegg CEO) Dan Rosensweig
              discusses the deal that he failed to seal, and what that path has meant for both
              Facebook and Yahoo!. Rosensweig also discusses every great entrepreneur's reluctance

                  <p>It's better for a CEO to describe success than to prescribe the exact methods
              employees must use to achieve it. This is done, says Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig, by
              establishing a company vision and sharing it often with employees. He advises to not
              think in terms of business models, but rather to reframe the questions to ensure your
              company is thinking big enough. Then, hire people willing to be part of a team that
              will be integral to this vision.</p>

                  <p>Dan Rosensweig worked with a number of industry leaders before becoming the CEO of
              Chegg, and his experience taught him to recognize practices of successful leadership.
              He suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs think big and optimistically. Solve problems,
              but don't whine about them. Surround yourself with people smarter than yourself, and
              give them the freedom to execute, trusting them to course-correct as they learn and
              improve. A great CEO doesn't need to be the smartest person in the room, states
              Rosensweig; they just need to know where to find an expert on any subject.</p>

                  <p>The way to find a career that you love is not to think of it as a job, says Chegg CEO
              Dan Rosensweig. He also offers many relevant insights. Follow your natural passions
              and inclinations and the work will simply follow. Work with people you trust, and give
              them everything you have. Don't concern yourself with the road not taken - but when
              you approach a perceived dead end, step away from the organization professionally. To
              find true enrichment from your work, start over and try again.</p>

                  <p>Serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist Suster, Mark urges entrepreneurs not to be
              lazy when it comes to doing necessary market research. This includes having a basic
              understanding of who will pay for your product or service. In the age of affordable
              research and engineering, smart venture capitalists now expect to see at least
              workable prototypes from startups seeking funding. Suster suggests numerous critical
              questions for entrepreneurs to ponder about their market, their product, and their
              competition.</p>

                  <p>Serial entrepreneur and investor Suster, Mark urges founders to start out on their
              own, to avoid early dilution. Suster believes entrepreneurs deserve to keep a greater
              share of their companies, when possible, as they are the ones taking the critical
              first leap. While Suster claims some in Silicon Valley may think this idea is
              "heresy," he does not understand why burgeoning entrepreneurs are willing to give so
              much away, so early. </p>

                  <p>While many legendary Silicon Valley companies were founded by teams of two,
              partnerships aren't without their problems, states venture capitalist Suster, Mark.
              Disagreements arise based on personal life changes, business strategies, and roles
              within the company. Suster prefers to avoid playing the role of co-founder "marriage
              counselor" by working with a strong, individual entrepreneur.</p>

                  <p>No Internet or tech company should launch without having in-house technical manpower
              to build the product, says serial entrepreneur Suster, Mark. While business savvy on
              the founding team is important, those skills need to be balanced with a sturdy base of
              engineering, programming, or other technical know-how. Additionally, a company makes
              itself more attractive to funding and acquisition if it has intrinsic technical
              expertise.</p>

                  <p>Venture capitalist Suster, Mark believes being a lean startup is related to size and
              funding levels, rather than speed and product iteration. However, once a startup finds
              a strong product and market fit, they will need to get "fat" quickly, in order to
              compete with larger companies, particularly in "winner take most" markets.</p>

              1) Your company name should be your URL address, 2) Don't let your company name box

              also explains why you should have the commitment to see your startup through.</p>

                  <p>Raising venture capital is worse than marriage, says investor and serial entrepreneur
              Suster, Mark, noting that you can at least get divorced when it comes to marriage.
              Suster expresses surprise that a startup team would be willing to accept a funding
              partnership, without taking the time to truly get to know the angel or VC. This
              business relationship is long, intimate, and permanent, so both parties should
              carefully choose their partners.</p>

                  <p>Which metrics indicate whether a venture capitalist is performing well? It's more
              than simple ROI. Venture capitalist Suster, Mark speaks of the three career phases to
              examine: 1) Building a pipeline of deals, 2) Nurturing your portfolio companies, and
              3) Harvesting investments and obtaining exits. He states that success in venture
              capital takes about a decade to determine.</p>

              difference indicative of the roaring 1990's - namely, $280 million in financing before
              the company turned a profit. Today, virtual product models and increased pressure on
              profitability would make this heavy financial front-loading difficult to achieve.</p>

                  <p>Maturity is the basis for a complimentary relationship between a new operations
              person and founders, says Align Technology CEO Prescott, Thomas. Both parties need to
              respect one another's strongest skills, assets, and objectives, and keep the health of
              the company as the overarching goal. Additionally, it's a good idea for both founder
              and operator to consider when they, too, will need to be replaced by those with better
              skills to achieve new levels of scale.</p>

                  <p>When introducing a new medical device such as "invisible" orthodontics, it can be a
              struggle to bring the medical community on board. Align Technology CEO Prescott,
              Thomas discusses the necessity of clinical research documentation and sales and
              marketing materials targeting both patients and practitioners as essential tools for
              product push. Prescott points out introducing new devices is particularly challenging
              when the technology does not improve patient mortality. </p>

              Technology. He quotes Clayton Christensen who advises entrepreneurs to, "Be patient
              for growth; don't be patient for profitability." Know from the onset how the company
              can be scaled and how it will be exited. Prescott says this is the difference between
              a company with longevity and one with simply an interesting product.</p>

                  <p>Align Technology CEO Prescott, Thomas urges entrepreneurs, particularly those
              operating as small fish amidst sharks, to keep asking themselves what someone else
              working in the field would have to do to out-innovate or out-perform your best
              efforts. Always know the answer to this question: "How can someone else satisfy your
              customer better?"</p>

              marketing.</p>

              factors must converge into a business model that is both viable and scalable.
              Fortunately, the Internet allows companies to rapidly test business models, for
              example, through the use of social media leveraged with demand creation and flexible
              pricing structures.</p>

                  <p>The lean startup operates with a business plan that can reshape until a successful
              business model develops. By quickly pivoting based on market feedback, a company can
              extend their runway without additional dilution from raising greater amounts of
              capital, according to FLOODGATE Fund partner Miura-Ko, Ann. She explains entrepreneurs
              can then make dollars last longer, which allows for an increase in possible product
              iterations. In today's business climate, Miura-Ko states, an entrepreneur never wants
              to run our of chances to iterate.</p>

                  <p>The amount of capital that you take in has nothing to do with the size of a company's
              ambitions, says Miura-Ko, Ann, co-founding partner at FLOODGATE. Historically, some of
              today's largest technology brands, such as Ebay, Microsoft, Apple, raised relatively
              low amounts of capital early on. Smart business models, data, and vision steer a
              company, regardless of its size, to scale sensibly and remain capital efficient.</p>

              that matters most, rather than the business plan. A well-thought out business model
              that is data-driven and scenario-focused will be seriously considered. According to
              Miura-Ko, models do a better job of unearthing assumptions about a company's users,
              customers, pricing, demand creation, sales channels, supply chain, and overall
              logistics - all critical components to building a successful venture. </p>

                  <p>The myth of work/life balance, says FLOODGATE Fund partner Miura-Ko, Ann, is that one
              can actually strike a balance. As a mother of two, she advises anyone with a family,
              who also seeks to carve a path in entrepreneurship, to recognize that it is a struggle
              to achieve balance. Knowing how much time and energy a new venture can demand, she
              states the importance of feeling passion for your business mission. Only a great
              venture will make taking time away from family feel like a worthy trade-off.</p>

                  <p>Stick to a vision and the company shall succeed, advises Amazon Senior VP Piacentini,
              Diego. For Amazon this means adhering to founder Jeff Bezos' original vision: Build a
              site where users can find anything they want to buy at the lowest price. To achieve
              this vision, Piacentini highlights Amazon's dedication to building all code in-house,
              and safety measures to validate customer purchases.</p>

                  <p>For Amazon, all operations are equal until proven - with data - that they need to be
              changed. For example, in China, it became apparent that Amazon had to invest in
              delivery systems for the last mile - which often means bicycle delivery. This unique
              need also mandated software for customers to schedule an exact delivery time, and for
              delivery staff to process payments. Amazon Senior VP Diego Pacentini uses this as an
              example of how the company adapts to its environment while still adhering to its core
              vision.</p>

              He discusses how the retailer decided to take a risk and move away from its core
              competency, build APIs, and rent out server space during slower retail months.
              Piacentini also talks about how other online giants have now followed Amazon's

                  <p>Bestselling author and Stanford professor Sutton, Bob offers insights from his book,
              Good Boss, Bad Boss. Two important points: 1) Individuals in a position of authority
              will be under intense scrutiny from those they manage; and 2) Leaders receive
              disproportionally more blame and more credit for organizational performance. Sutton
              shares some surprising statistics related to this point, and explains that the best
              bosses work hard to remain in-tune with those they manage. </p>

                  <p>According to author Sutton, Bob, when someone is placed in a position of power, three
              things can happen to cause "power poisoning": 1) The individual focuses on their own
              needs and concerns; 2) The individual focuses little attention on the needs of others;
              and 3) The individual often acts like the rules don't apply to them. Evidence is also
              mounting, says Sutton, that the more successful a manager is, the more likely they are
              to break the rules.</p>

                  <p>Stanford professor and author Sutton, Bob covers a number of hallmarks and strategies
              of smart, in-tune bosses. While traditional management theory dictates constant
              monitoring of employees and processes, this may not be the best tactic, says Sutton.
              His research reports this is particularly true for bosses managing creative teams and
              employees. In these situations, over-management can backfire, often stifling
              creativity and innovation. </p>

                  <p>Not only can some bosses be difficult to talk to, but there are a number of
              institutional structures in place that make it difficult for them to hear the truth.
              Stanford Professor Sutton, Bob bullet points many documented human behaviors that make
              it difficult for managers to hear the whole story. For example, research shows that
              people like flattery - even if its false - and people tend not to like those who
              deliver bad news. </p>

                  <p>Stanford Professor Sutton, Bob suggests two strategies for dealing with team
              disagreements. Never knock down ideas during the brainstorming stage. And if a team
              decides to go with a decision you disagree with, be the hardest worker during the
              idea's implementation. By committing yourself to helping make the idea a success, if
              it does indeed fail in the end, you will know that it was indeed a poor idea.</p>

                  <p>A successful personal relationship must follow the 5:1 rule: for every unpleasant
              interaction, at least five positive interactions are needed to offset the negative
              one, says Stanford Professor and author Sutton, Bob. Research in the workplace also
              shows that just one rotten apple - or someone who repeatedly proves to be selfish -
              can be contagion that severely reduces overall team performance. These contagions must
              be removed for the health and longevity of the team.</p>

                  <p>According to author Sutton, Bob, interviews are terrible predictors of what is going
              to happen in a working environment. However, there are some indicators to look for to
              determine if a prospective supervisor will be pleasant and effective. For example,
              listen to the number of "I's" versus "we's" the prospective employer uses when
              describing a project, advises Stanford Professor Sutton, Bob. Are they a team player?
              Will they offer credit to others? An even better strategy is to find former employees
              and ask them about their day-to-day experience with the supervisor in question.</p>

                  <p>Happiness drives many of us, but often down the wrong road. How can our desire to
              please ourselves so often lead us astray? Stanford Graduate School of Business
              Professor Aaker, Jennifer states that happiness has many nuanced definitions between
              excitement and peacefulness. The way you choose to define it is dependent on
              demographics, including factors like gender, age, mindset, and culture. Moreover,
              these perceived feelings of happiness evolve over a lifetime, and inform how one makes
              decisions.</p>

              for happiness offers longer-lasting joy for oneself and other members of a community.
              This environment would enable people to find real meaning, make real connections, and
              feel that they are a part of something bigger. In addition, this is a particularly

                  <p>One lesson taught by Stanford GSB Professor Aaker, Jennifer is to include the
              opposite of every idea proposed in a brainstorming session. This tool vastly expands
              the number ideas, both excellent and terrible in equal proportion. This thinking led
              one former student to launch a social media campaign to register 20,000 South Asian
              bone marrow donors to find a match for a friend with leukemia. The result not only
              increased disease awareness and found a donor, but it also provided an excellent
              example of successful social networking, factoring in the strength of a specific goal,
              the power of reversing the rules, the necessity of creating a campaign that allows for
              no-fuss collaboration, and the need to tell a good story.</p>

                  <p>Using the case study of Team Sameer - a successful social media campaign to find a
              bone marrow donor for a man with leukemia - Stanford GSB professor Aaker, Jennifer
              goes into detail on the effective strategies of an email plea sent to just 450 people,
              which lead to nearly 25,000 participants nationwide. Communicating a story through
              focused, humanistic messaging is an imperative element for social media that drives

              more often, giving employees their own blogs, Twitter feeds, etc., which allows

              try to quash those who freely share their opinions.</p>

                  <p>Billing is less of an issue, if you build a relationship with legal advisors you
              trust, says attorney Martin Nichols. Entrepreneurs should share their acceptable fee
              ranges with attorneys, but they may also be able to work out fee caps and flat rates
              for services. Clients can help ensure the best service from attorneys by showing
              mutual respect through offering referrals and paying bills on time.</p>

                  <p>Attorney Martin Nichols suggests separating legal issues from business issues before
              entering into negotiations. This strategy is often very helpful, particularly in
              face-to-face negotiations. In meetings and conference calls, Nichols sets out an
              agenda and key issues, and then tries to come up with a basket of issues for the
              business people to try and work out with their counterparts.</p>

                  <p>Attorney Martin Nichols believes clients should receive the best practical advice
              from an attorney, even when the client is in a legally superior position during a
              negotiation. Nichols shares an anecdote where he needed to explain to a client the
              practical value of not fighting for a previously agreed on payment, to avoid being
              exposed to legal costs of an even greater amount. </p>

                  <p>According to attorney Martin Nichols, entrepreneurs need to have a great deal of
              trust when sharing intellectual property with venture capitalists, as VCs often will
              not sign non-disclosure agreements. If a client is working on patentable technologies,
              Nichols suggests trying to button up those issues before going to meetings.</p>

                  <p>The industry norm is for attorneys not to take equity or a board seat as forms of
              compensation from startups, says attorney Martin Nichols. In Silicon Valley, fee
              deferrals are far more normal. Big legal firms may be less likely to work with small
              startups due to time and revenue constraints, but a smaller firm may not be able to
              provide a startup with everything that is needed when it comes time for big
              transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions.</p>

                  <p>Teach For America CEO and Founder Kopp, Wendy is amazed at where educational reform
              is today, compared to where it once was in America. As an example, in the past, it
              would have been challenging to find evidence showing that schools can overcome the
              socio-economic disadvantages of their students, says Kopp. She states that evidence
              now shows this to be possible, and while questions of how to scale successful models
              persist, Kopp believes there are reasons to be optimistic about making fundamental
              changes to the education system.</p>

                  <p>Embrace your inexperience, says Kopp, Wendy, CEO and Founder of Teach For America, as
              "inexperience can be an asset because you don't know what is impossible." Kopp reminds
              social entrepreneurs they will need a lot of help, and to not try to do it all alone.
              Kopp also encourages social entrepreneurs to remain on a constant search for allies
              who can help you fulfill your mission.</p>

                  <p>Kopp, Wendy, CEO and founder of Teach For America, believes that many critics of her
              organization are misinformed about the thoroughness of the program. Kopp is willing to
              put Teach For America's pre-service teacher training up against that of any other
              organization, and she believes their recruitment process constantly improves. Rather
              than being a "band-aid" to the education crisis, Kopp sees Teach For America as
              answering an urgent need that the nation can no longer wait to address.</p>

              follow through on developing his company. Levie started Box.net after seeing his
              fellow students' need for cost-effective, online storage. After launching Box from his
              dorm room, and finding initial success, Levie realized he would not only need greater
              funding, but would also have to leave school to fully capitalize on this
              once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>

                  <p>At Box.net's inception, customers were charged for storage when they signed up.
              However, Box.net CEO and Co-Founder Levie, Aaron, and his team, realized they wanted
              to grow the customer base by lowering barriers to product adoption. In this clip,
              Levie describes the company's successful implementation of the "freemium" business
              model, which not only increased their number of customers, but also served as a
              differentiator from larger competitors.</p>

                  <p>Having started Box.net in his college dorm room, CEO Levie, Aaron has learned some
              valuable lessons. In this clip, Levie elaborates on five lessons: 1) Do something that
              was not possible three years ago, 2) Do something you are extremely passionate about,
              3) Don't compromise, 4) If you feel comfortable, you're probably not doing it right,
              and 5) Don't write your obituary too early.</p>

                  <p>Box.net CEO and Co-Founder Levie, Aaron started his company with friends he had known
              since high school. Levie shares the dangers and benefits of starting an organization
              with close friends, including the positive "hum" and high level of trust that can
              build between group members dedicated to a vision.</p>

                  <p>According to Levie, Aaron, CEO and co-founder of Box.net, successful startups need to
              be agile when testing ideas in the market and quick to shut down ideas that don't
              work. Beyond the power of learning to "fail fast," Levie advises close examination of
              who you are actually competing with to discover ways to innovate that competitors may
              not be built to do.</p>

                  <p>When entrepreneurs are working with big ideas, they also need to remember to grow the

              urges founders with big ideas not to be easily lured from their big vision, due to
              external pressures to accumulate small monetary wins.</p>

              take on outside investment, a decision that reaped benefits. Constantz also describes
              serving as the sole board member, which meant avoiding the loss of time management
              teams suffer when dealing with larger boards. Constantz states this saved time can
              then be put toward a better use ? fulfilling the company's vision.</p>

              thing that is never going to happen.</p>

                  <p>Founder Constantz, Brent describes the early breakthrough moments at Calera,
              including realizing the value in actively sequestering carbon dioxide. According to

              cleaning up the environment is to make doing so a prosperous opportunity for
              businesses and investors.</p>

                  <p>UCSF Chancellor Desmond-Hellmann, Susan explains the growing need to incentivize and
              reward team achievements. While principal investigators in scientific fields have
              historically been rewarded for solo achievements, many of the today's goals and
              projects facing science and technology require team efforts, says Desmond-Hellmann.
              Moreover, she believes the question of how to best encourage and reward
              team-supportive behavior is crucial for leaders in these fields.</p>

                  <p>Desmond-Hellmann, Susan, chancellor of UCSF, has a big idea to change the drug
              approval process at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The current process is
              binary, allowing for only a yes or no from the reviewer for drug approval.
              Desmond-Hellmann suggests that a variable approval process, that can change status as
              greater evidence comes in over time, will encourage more innovative products and even
              investment funding, based on product confidence.</p>

                  <p>Desmond-Hellmann, Susan, chancellor of UCSF, identifies traits that appear over and
              over again in successful entrepreneurs. The first trait is a relentless tenacity mixed
              with optimism, a quality she describes as being like "a dog on a bone." The other
              critical trait is not being afraid to be embarrassed. According to Desmond-Hellmann,
              risk-taking entrepreneurs make choices others may find embarrassing, but entrepreneurs
              must continue to follow their own path.</p>

              in love with maps, while growing up in St. Louis, Missouri. Dorsey taught himself to
              program computers because he wanted to design maps, an activity that led to his deeper
              exploration of dispatch software development. Dorsey describes his early exposure to
              data visualization as, the "most beautiful thing that I could visualize, a city living
              and breathing." </p>

              existence, while he was working at Odeo, a consumer podcasting company. Dorsey joined
              Odeo to gain a greater understanding of the consumer Internet market, but eventually
              learned that few people at the company, including him, were interested in podcasting.
              Dorsey says the Twitter project began at Odeo, when at the company's urging for new
              ideas, he suggested the concept that would become Twitter.</p>

                  <p>Square and Twitter Co-Founder Dorsey, Jack views payments not only as an exchange of
              value, but also as a form of communication. Although everyone can relate to money,
              says Dorsey, very little thought has gone into design and user experience for payment
              transactions. Dorsey shares his desire to build a cohesive point-of-sale system that
              is far more useful for merchants and customers.</p>

                  <p>Square and Twitter Co-Founder Dorsey, Jack explains some important steps to becoming
              a better storyteller. According to Dorsey, the first step is to get ideas out of your
              head, whether you do it by writing or coding. Once the ideas can be reviewed outside
              your head, you can then decide whether to share them, or put them on the shelf for
              later use. Dorsey also explains his admiration for Apple's ability to tell epic
              stories.</p>

              strategy, but he believes that any strategy is only as good as the tactical plan

                  <p>Idealab Founder and CEO Gross, Bill articulates two organizational ways his company
              develops motivation. The first is to ensure employees working on a new spin-off
              venture each have a true equity stake in the startup company. The second is to
              encourage risk-taking at Idealab through the company's willingness to shut down
              unsuccessful projects with no negative impact to employees. According to Gross, "If
              you really want to have some breakthrough new thing, you can't have someone worrying
              about their job being on the line, for trying something bold and new." </p>

                  <p>A number of companies born from Idealab were started way too soon, says Founder and
              CEO Gross, Bill. However, a number of these firms went on to success, as Idealab
              fostered their development until the market was ready. In this clip, Gross explains
              why solid cash management is often the key tool in surviving until customer demand, or
              acquisition interest, adequately develops.</p>

              eye. However, the best management teams consist of a strong mix of all four types,

              energy being the best possible source for the planet's growing energy demands. He
              illuminates the reality of current energy usage, the socio-economic factors that will
              impact future needs, and the limitations of other non-fossil fuel energy options.
              Gross is chairman of eSolar, an Idealab spin-off that focuses on making solar energy
              cost-competitive in the global marketplace.</p>

              and cost-competitive. After examining current solar energy harnessing techniques,
              Gross focused his attention on applying Moore's Law to high-efficiency solar
              conversion systems. eSolar was founded to work on the development of these ideas. In

              willingness to hear ideas from outside the company and the competitive advantage that
              this may or may not provide. Gross says Idealab now spends more time hearing ideas
              from external sources than they did in the past. He also articulates Idealab's
              principle of trying to judge ideas more on their possible impact on society than on a
              projected return on investment.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneur and author Kawasaki, Guy steps through companies that built their
              success on trust, and offers insights on the role of trust in relationships and
              individual attitudes. Kawasaki urges individuals to be "bakers," meaning trustworthy
              individuals seeking to create larger pies to share in the world. He also describes the
              value in building trust by "defaulting to yes."</p>

                  <p>Author Kawasaki, Guy suggests teams conduct a "pre-mortem" before launching a
              product. This technique allows teams to discover possible problems, or ways the launch
              could fail, while there is still time to make adjustments. Kawasaki explains this
              method is far more helpful, and far less contentious, than postmortem meetings that
              come too late to help.</p>

              this clip, he uses Silicon Valley examples to explain the importance of the skill. He
              also urges entrepreneurs and startups to "plant many seeds" when it comes to getting
              the word out about new products. According to Kawasaki, this advice may eschew
              traditional marketing philosophy, but with the media world now inverted, entrepreneurs
              never know which outlets will make the difference in building critical mass for a
              product. </p>

              record the group's music at concerts and to then share the music with others. This
              seemingly counter-intuitive idea, according to Kawasaki, is an important key to the

                  <p>Entrepreneur and author Kawasaki, Guy teaches how to enchant bosses and employees. To
              enchant bosses, Kawasaki believes employees should drop what they are doing to
              respond, provide prototypes throughout the process of completing a request, and report
              bad news (and possible solutions) as soon as possible. To enchant employees, Kawasaki
              explains the need for bosses to provide their employees with the opportunity to master
              new skills and to work autonomously, preferably in an organization with a higher
              purpose. </p>

              into public health, but her experiences living and working with women in the villages
              of Namibia inspired a new interest in exploring connections between resource
              management and the drivers of poverty. </p>

              Conservation International Executive VP Morris, Jennifer believes it is critically
              important quantify the value of "ecosystem services," those resources and processes
              nature provides for planet and human survival. She shares two quantifiable examples:
              the value of insect pollination to agriculture, and the pharmaceutical industry's
              dependence on natural plant resources. </p>

                  <p>Cap-and-trade carbon markets continue to gain traction, but how do you monetize
              something you can't see and that has never been valued? Conservation International
              Executive VP Morris, Jennifer sees interesting opportunities in the area of forest
              carbons, which are emissions released from deforestation. However, according to
              Morris, serious challenges to carbon markets include the lack of a global market
              framework, the thorny issue of carbon tenure rights, and the large amount of capital
              required to engage the issue. </p>

                  <p>Water markets can be more challenging to monetize than carbon markets, according to
              Morris, Jennifer, Executive VP of Conservation International. Morris says that to
              drive watershed service transactions, market mechanisms must provide "financial
              incentives to people who manage land to protect their watershed." Due to deforestation
              in China, and the resulting siltation and sedimentation, dam operators in that country
              are developing new models for water markets, in concert with Conservation
              International and interested corporate partners.</p>

                  <p>According to Executive VP Morris, Jennifer, Conservation International focuses on
              creating long-term, sustainable mechanisms to power growth, because offering only
              "short-term grants will probably lead to short-term success." In this clip, Morris
              explains how tapping a nation or corporation's "enlightened self-interest" can be a
              component to creating successful endowment funds to support communities and
              conservation.</p>

              projects, Morris believes the key is to create fundamental change in the business
              model of development, by convincing business and political leaders to incorporate
              natural capital "externalities" into their accounting systems and operational

                  <p>SecondMarket Founder and CEO Silbert, Barry thinks his online marketplace for trading
              alternative assets can play an important role in creating a new model for capital
              markets. In this lecture, Silbert explains his personal path into entrepreneurship and
              describes the current growth of his firm, which has drawn attention for trading
              private stock in companies such as Facebook and Twitter. Silbert also offers reasons
              for why he thinks current public markets are broken and his vision of a new way
              forward. </p>

                  <p>Just open your doors and start a business, is the best advice ever received by
              SecondMarket Founder and CEO Silbert, Barry. SecondMarket started with a very simple
              operation, experienced profitable growth over the next five years, and now stands to
              play an even larger role in the secondary markets space. In this clip, Silbert
              discusses his company's growth history and shares milestones achieved along the
              way.</p>

              conform to the market.</p>

                  <p>Author Brafman, Ori describes behaviors of good "clickers," those individuals skilled
              in making instant connections with others. Brafman relates two studies, one focusing
              on MBA students, and the other on members of a string quartet, that reveal insights
              about interaction between "clickers": 1) They show greater support for colleagues, and
              2) They create more conflict, but deal with it head-on.</p>

                  <p>Leaders who are vulnerable are far more trusted by their employees, says Brafman,
              Ori, bestselling author of Click: The Magic of Instant Connections. Brafman explains
              that vulnerability, while often seen as a weakness in business, is a valuable skill
              that can play a critical role in binding deep, immediate relationships in the
              workplace. To illustrate this point, Brafman shares the unique story of a hostage
              negotiator's willingness to reveal vulnerability to help form an intense, but
              unlikely, relationship.</p>

                  <p>Proximity plays a major role in helping individuals to form instant connections with
              others, says bestselling author Brafman, Ori. In this clip, Brafman reveals how
              distance affects the building of relationships, citing an interesting study of college
              dormitory residents at MIT. He also demonstrates the power of proximity on team
              dynamics with an interactive demonstration of behavior in a meeting environment.</p>

                  <p>Author Brafman, Ori explains how certain individuals have an increased ability to
              form connections. According to Brafman, these "high self-monitors" exhibit
              characteristics that offer advantages for relationship building, the most prominent
              characteristic being a willingness to modulate behavior and actions "to meet others
              where they are." Brafman also describes how a high self-monitor's ability to "mirror
              into a situation" can pay major dividends in terms of network building and career
              development.</p>

                  <p>Author Brafman, Ori discusses building trust-based networks to generate
              collaboration. He highlights intriguing information that indicates Americans traded
              away deeper emotional connections in the rising age of social networking, in favor of
              having a greater number of lighter, cross-silo connections. While some argue that
              consequences arise from a focus on creating connections primarily with those similar
              to yourself, Brafman believes richer, intimate connections are still critical to
              pursue.</p>

                  <p>Scheller, Richard, Genentech's Executive Vice President of Research and Early

              thought-provoking ethical issues that arise in the drug development process. To

              placebo process, often required by the Food and Drug Administration. He also
              articulates some of the ethical implications related to drug costs and insurance

                  <p>In this high-energy lecture, Moore, Geoffrey discusses how companies can build the
              escape velocity necessary to move beyond the successes and failures of the past. Moore
              argues that when companies focus too much on performance, they miss out on building
              the power to become the industry leaders that other companies envy. He shares a
              hierarchy model through which companies can examine and build power, and examines how
              product teams can best work to differentiate their company, neutralize the
              competition, and optimize products and offers.</p>

                  <p>Technology moves too fast to justify standing still on innovation, says author and
              MDV venture partner Moore, Geoffrey. He believes big companies, while always
              incubating new ideas, have a difficult time shifting resources to support long-term
              commercial development of new activities. "There's always new stuff," Moore says, "but
              it never reaches materiality." </p>

                  <p>Author and MDV Venture Partner Moore, Geoffrey describes the trap of compensating
              employees based solely on performance metrics. Developing new initiatives or ideas
              creates the "power" for a company's long-term growth, so employees should also be
              compensated on this measure. According to Moore, "power fuels performance, and
              performance consumes power," so why will employees help create new power if they are
              not held accountable for consuming it, nor rewarded for creating it.</p>

                  <p>Moore, Geoffrey explains the neurotic endgame that occurs when organizations lacking

              organizations that feel these pressures have already lost the power game. In this
              clip, Moore also articulates how companies can find ways to allocate resources to
              innovation, before getting caught in the annual budget process. </p>

              their position and strength in relation to growth categories, other companies,
              desirable markets, offers, and the ability to execute. Moore says this process
              requires companies to be completely honest with their current situation.</p>

                  <p>Real differentiation is about going well beyond the limits of your competitive set,
              not just being best in class, says author Moore, Geoffrey. Here he encourages product
              managers and other members of management to consider how far they can take their
              company's offers to create real separation from competitors. Moore also shares real
              world examples of companies that created separation in the technology sector.</p>

                  <p>Author and MDV Venture Partner Moore, Geoffrey explains why companies must, at
              minimum, keep up with competitors to be considered by customers. According to Moore,
              every quarter a company does not catch up to a competitor's offer is just another
              chance for that competitor to gain momentum. Moore uses numerous examples from the
              technology sector to illustrate the danger of being too proud to assimilate a
              competitor's innovations.</p>

                  <p>Instagram Co-Founder Mike Krieger encourages aspiring entrepreneurs to avoid
              following trends. He explains founders deal with uncertainty everyday, so you should
              pursue ideas that you truly believe in. Krieger also believes it's important to
              collect experience, including the completion of side projects on nights and weekends.
              Fellow Co-Founder Kevin Systrom also warns against becoming caught up in
              entrepreneurship as a lifestyle choice.</p>

                  <p>Co-Founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were able to launch Instagram without
              being computer science graduates. Krieger is proud of this fact, as it shows students
              from other disciplines can start companies in the technology space. He recalls his
              most valuable Stanford courses as the ones that taught him to define questions and
              then allowed him the freedom to seek the answers. In this clip, fellow Co-Founder
              Kevin Systrom also talks about the importance of connecting with other members of the
              entrepreneurial community.</p>

                  <p>Seeking venture capital is like hiring people for your team, says Instagram
              Co-Founder Kevin Systrom. Here he encourages aspiring founders to find funding from
              individuals that truly believe in what you are trying to achieve, rather than those
              seeking immediate boosts in valuation. According to Systrom, "Rather than optimizing
              for valuation, it's far better to optimize for people." In this clip, he recounts
              Instagram's ability to launch with limited expenses and discusses the importance of
              working on prototypes rather than company slide decks. </p>

                  <p>Building an incredible product or service is just part of starting a company,
              according to Instagram Co-Founder Kevin Systrom. In this clip, he explains how much
              legwork is involved in filing paperwork, understanding regulations and taxes, and
              other operational issues. Systrom also identifies recruiting and gaining funding as
              areas requiring a great deal of focus from founders.</p>

                  <p>Instagram Co-Founder Mike Krieger explains how the best startups are born from
              combining a number of ideas into something new. The best idea won't come as an "a-ha"
              moment, but from exploring the entire solution space to discover where your idea fits.
              Krieger also describes the entrepreneur's journey as being a series of ideas connected
              by a consistent theme.</p>

              student. He also encourages entrepreneurs to start right now to build out their

              Systrom and Mike Krieger describe their working relationship. Both Systrom and Krieger
              explain the stages of their relationship, and how the partnership respects each
              other's areas of specialty, while also providing a tremendous opportunity to sound out
              ideas. Because of this benefit, Systrom explains the co-founder relationship needs to

              can prevent the relationship from wearing down over time.</p>

                  <p>Instagram Co-Founder Kevin Systrom is confused as to how equity distributions are
              handled by other startups. Here he advises founders to be as fair and generous as
              possible, throughout the different stages of startup growth. Fellow Co-Founder Mike
              Krieger also articulates why equity shares should rightfully be based on the level of
              risk involved, when a founder or early employee decides to join the startup. </p>

                  <p>Casares, Wences and Meyer "Micky" Malka are serial entrepreneurs who believe in the
              fundamental power of partnerships. Empowered by working in close collaboration for
              years, these co-founders have started multiple companies including Patagon, Lemon Bank
              and Bling Nation. In this revealing lecture, Casares and Malka describe the value of
              over-communication, the decision process in making a pivot, and the challenges of
              entrepreneurial ecosystems outside the United States.</p>

              their willingness to embrace e-commerce in the past. </p>

                  <p>While serial entrepreneur Casares, Wences concedes startup success rates are low
              around the world, he argues that Latin America-based startups face additional
              challenges due to friction points in the regional ecosystem. Casares also outlines an
              intriguing benefit to building talented technical teams in the developing world.
              Fellow entrepreneur Meyer Malka highlights differences between investment options in
              Silicon Valley and Latin America.</p>

                  <p>As co-founders, Casares, Wences and Meyer Malka don't believe in dividing their
              roles, Even though each man has areas of strength, both want to communicate with a

              policy also requires them to keep disagreements to themselves.</p>

                  <p>To be an entrepreneur, you need to have some super strong convictions, says serial
              entrepreneur Casares, Wences. However, even if you hold strong opinions on products,
              markets and customers, Casares says entrepreneurs must also have the humility to
              change course when circumstances call for a new approach.</p>

                  <p>Bling Nation Co-Founder Casares, Wences warns against being too focused on the
              technology of mobile payments. According to Casares, the real question is how the
              necessary infrastructure will evolve to support merchants' ability to smoothly process
              payments with banking institutions. As big players are now entering the space, Casares
              believes the best chance for startups will be in attacking the gaps in future
              development.</p>

                  <p>According to Chopra, Aneesh, former Chief Technology Officer of the United States,
              fixing the nation's broken immigration system will support American growth and
              innovation. Chopra shares his personal perspective on the issue, as his father was an
              engineer who immigrated to America for work. Chopra argues that it's time to explore
              new ideas to solve the immigration issue, including changes to the work visa
              system.</p>

              entrepreneurial opportunities in healthcare innovation. Chopra discusses how moving
              the American healthcare system to focus on value over volume opens the door to new
              businesses, while also improving patient care. He also explains why current
              legislation now provides greater incentives for investors to participate in these

                  <p>Chopra, Aneesh, Chief Technology Officer of the United States, shares the importance
              of igniting innovation to reform America's education system. Chopra says that while
              the American education sector is approximately the same size as the pharmaceutical
              sector, it invests almost nothing in research and development, by comparison. Chopra
              articulates the government's interest in spurring the development of education
              technology innovations that are as effective as the best tutors, while being as
              engaging as the most popular video games.</p>

              success. </p>

              it requires perpetual change. This means convincing the very intelligent members of a
              team that failure is not only acceptable, but is a required part of the process.
              According to Friedberg, "failure must be part of the mission."</p>

                  <p>Co-Founder and CEO Phil Libin says he has no exit strategy for Evernote. Libin
              challenges conventional startup thinking by asserting that if you want to exit there
              must be something wrong with your company. Evernote has structured its board in a
              specific way and turns down repeated offers for purchase, according to Libin, because
              "it's much more interesting to come into work, when you're pursuing your life's
              dream."</p>

                  <p>Evernote Co-Founder and CEO Phil Libin dispels myths about being an entrepreneur. He
              outlines a number of bad reasons to be become one, including a desire for free time
              and wealth. According to Libin, "If you want to be an entrepreneur to make money, then
              you're just bad at math."</p>

                  <p>Serial entrepreneur Phil Libin believes now is 'the best time in the history of the
              universe" to start a new company. The Evernote CEO argues that today we live in a geek
              meritocracy where great products are king. He encourages entrepreneurs to take
              advantage of modern distribution tools such as app stores, social conversations,
              free-mium economics, and smart phone technology.</p>

              the need for company exit strategies is decoupled from the desire for liquidity. He
              also articulates how secondary markets now offer companies and investors new
              opportunities for liquidity during subsequent funding rounds. </p>

                  <p>Reflecting on his work with great entrepreneurs, investor Feld, Brad believes the
              notion of "trying" to do something can undermine entrepreneurs from the start. At the
              Foundry Group, Feld and his partners look for entrepreneurs who are deeply obsessed
              with a vision and passion for their product and company. Feld also describes how being
              an angel investor versus a venture investor can shift how one views possible
              investments. </p>

              path. According to Feld, "The essence of what you're trying to do... is to create
              amazing things that impact all of us." The tactics around entrepreneurial success
              probably don't matter very much, says Feld, if you are not working on something you
              are passionate about. </p>

                  <p>Bespoke Innovations Co-Founder Summit, Scott explains how the mantra "form follows
              function" has been contorted into the idea "form follows mechanical function."
              According to Summit, this change has allowed product designers to think they have a
              free reign to create clunky and purely utilitarian designs. Summit relates how Bespoke
              works to counter this idea when designing prosthetic legs that possess greater form
              and artistry.</p>

              finding a working business model and matching product to customers in a viable market.
              Originally inspired to bring prosthetic legs to customers in the developing world,
              Summit and his team faced issues of cost, time and complexity, which lead them to
              eventually focus on higher-end offerings for customers in the U.S. market.</p>

              an entrepreneurial mindset is a belief system that not only requires a belief in big
              ideas, but includes believing in oneself and working with others that believe in
              you.</p>

                  <p>As CEO of MySQL AB, Mňrten Mickos saw advantages of utilizing a distributed
              organization model where seventy percent of the company's employees worked from home.
              According to Mickos, this cultural design actually put the focus on results and
              productivity, while still allowing colleagues to share their lives with one
              another.</p>

                  <p>When it comes to management, Eucalyptus Systems CEO Mňrten Mickos respects the value
              of individual human beings. His perspective grew out of earlier career experiences
              where employees were treated like machines, rather than people. "Can't we treat the
              human beings like human beings, and treat the machines like machines," says
              Mickos.</p>

                  <p>Eucalyptus Systems CEO Mňrten Mickos loves the expression, "He was a great executive.
              All he lacked was inexperience." Mickos explains how inexperience can be a tremendous
              asset to an entrepreneur, and he shares his personal story of transformation from open
              source neophyte to being perceived as a "godfather" of open source business
              models.</p>

                  <p>KPCB Partner Mead, Dana offers a historical perspective of venture capital, from its
              origin as a boutique industry to its current place as an established asset class. Mead
              also discusses why university endowments, particularly those at Stanford and Yale,
              drove the explosive growth of venture capital in California and the rest of the United
              States.</p>

              partners. Mead also lays out how a venture capital firm is paid through management
              fees and a percentage of the "carry," or any returns beyond the initial
              investments.</p>

              capitalist, where he focuses on looking at new ventures, working with entrepreneurs at
              current ventures and networking. "We practice really hard everyday at saying no
              nicely," says Mead, as it's important to maintain relationships with entrepreneurs and
              leave the door open for other deals down the road.</p>

              probably not start with venture capital firms. When searching for early seed funds,
              Mead suggests friends, colleagues and angel investors as more likely and effective
              sources.</p>

                  <p>According to venture capitalist Mead, Dana, if you come in for a meeting, "don't be
              afraid to talk about what the risks are." Mead asserts that venture capitalists deal
              with risk all the time, so entrepreneurs make a mistake in presenting rosy pictures
              for growth and revenue, without presenting a balanced picture that includes risks
              around a new venture.</p>

              plan to try and raise money.</p>

              a friend had an idea for a product that solved their problems managing business
              finances. Mah describes the value of finishing college, and some of the early customer
              insights gained while building the first iteration of the product.</p>

                  <p>Business model innovator Osterwalder, Alexander lays out reasons to map a product or
              service's value proposition with the actual pains customers face. Using building

              discusses, with interviewer Blank, Steve, how value is created.</p>

                  <p>When you have something that is so complicated people can't understand it, you're
              doing the wrong thing, says Zoller, Ted, senior fellow with the Kauffman Foundation.
              Zoller articulates why teams can leverage a mix of optimistic and pessimistic
              personalities, and why money should be viewed as a tool. "Money is not evil, it's a
              tool. You can use it to make your ideas available."</p>

              Kauffman Foundation Senior Fellow Zoller, Ted. In this clip, Zoller asks the audience

              when it presents itself. He also explains how successful entrepreneurs make moves at
              the right moment to capitalize on fortune.</p>

                  <p>Kauffman Foundation Senior Fellow Zoller, Ted describes his findings on the pathways

              starting a company out of school or working in venture capital, Zoller says the most
              likely path is gaining a C-suite position in a larger enterprise and then stepping

              come next for the consumer. She explains that venture firms want to invest in
              companies that have this person on the team and why this is not always the person
              serving as CEO.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneur Cassidy, Sukhinder Singh argues the judgment to know at what level to
              examine your business at any given moment is a vital leadership quality. Using a short
              anecdote from her time at Google, Singh Cassidy explains successful founders and
              executives must understand the tactical drivers of a business to effectively manage
              from the top of an organization. </p>

                  <p>Founders often work in environments where data to test assumptions is not yet
              available, according to JOYUS Founder Cassidy, Sukhinder Singh. Rather than working
              solely from instinct, or becoming paralyzed by too much data, Singh Cassidy suggests
              an approach in the middle where you quickly gain data and test your gut instincts to
              create "informed intuition."</p>

              Singh sees this as a false dilemma and encourages entrepreneurs to focus on increasing

              tactically mean when you need to ship product, asks entrepreneur Cassidy, Sukhinder
              Singh. Here the JOYUS co-founder talks about the need to fairly evaluate employee
              skill and value sets, while still preserving enough space to make changes to your team
              as the needs of a company alter over time.</p>

                  <p>According to Murray, Brian, CEO and president of HarperCollins, the publishing
              industry has traditionally functioned using a business-to-business model, eschewing
              direct relationships with consumers. In conversation with STVP Executive Director
              Seelig, Tina, Murray explains why his company puts its authors forward as the
              brand.</p>

                  <p>Spotify Co-Founder Ek, Daniel explains his approach to building products to solve
              problems, with KPCB venture capitalist Chi-Hua Chien. Ek credits his engineering
              background and the ability to test product iterations as key components in his
              approach. He also discusses the importance of streamlined user interfaces, the
              opportunity to leverage global platforms to reach audiences at scale, and being
              selective in addressing the right customer use cases.</p>

                  <p>Spotify Co-Founder Ek, Daniel examines some of the mistakes he has made as a serial
              entrepreneur. Chief among them, says Ek, is saying 'yes' to everything and trying to
              do too much at once, which never works out. Ek also articulates the dangers of waiting
              too long in hiring and firing team members within a quickly growing organization.
              Especially in a small company, "everyone needs to carry their weight, and more," says
              Ek.</p>

                  <p>Part of Apple's success is due to the company's ability to integrate hardware and
              software, says Fortune magazine Senior Editor Lashinsky, Adam. Here the author of
              Inside Apple explains how the company wins by using a classic vertical integration
              model, saying 'no' to unnecessary features, and also excels at innovation by allowing
              product design to lead over engineering or financial concerns. </p>

              Lashinsky also outlines the backgrounds and experience of Apple's current upper

                  <p>Apple is a culture of work; it's not a culture of play, says Inside Apple author
              Lashinsky, Adam. In response to a question comparing the cultures of Apple and Google,
              Lashinsky agrees the two are diametrically opposed, and that Apple sees little value
              in trying to "entertain its employees." While Apple is a demanding environment, says
              Lashinsky, many employees love the experience as they are given the opportunity to do
              the best work of their careers.</p>

                  <p>Dropbox Co-Founder Houston, Drew believes false mythologies about tech company
              founders do a disservice to aspiring entrepreneurs. While many people think all tech
              founders start with world conquering visions, says Houston, the reality is that
              founders learn one day at a time just like everyone else.</p>

                  <p>According to Dropbox Co-Founder Houston, Drew, the need for product distribution
              strategies is often overlooked at startups. Here he shares some of the mistakes he

                  <p>While it is important to consider the competition, says Dropbox Co-Founder Houston,
              Drew, time and energy are better spent on factors within your control. Houston asserts
              a strong internal focus is far more important than worrying about competition, because
              for startups, "suicide is a much more common cause of death than homicide."</p>

                  <p>Taking venture capital isn't for everybody, according to Yang, Geoff, a founding

              resources, unbiased expertise, and access to valuable networks, says Yang,
              entrepreneurs must understand that in exchange for these resources they will be giving
              up some ownership and control.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneurship is not synonymous with being a founder, says Roelof Botha, a partner
              at Sequoia Capital. Using examples from his colleagues at PayPal, Botha urges
              individuals with an entrepreneurial drive to join other small companies first to learn
              a lot and live out the entrepreneurial spirit before founding a company.</p>

                  <p>Responding to a question from Heidi Roizen, Stanford alumni panelists describe the
              challenge of exporting aspects of Stanford's entrepreneurial ecosystem. Sequoia
              Capital's Roelof Botha expresses the need for patience in developing interplay between
              academia, finance and industry, as well as flexible legal and financial conditions.
              Kit Rodgers of Cryptography Research also articulates why a willingness to fail is a
              crucial attitude for developing a vibrant ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>Wasserman, Noam, of Harvard Business School, explains how he came to focus on trying
              to understand why high potential startups commonly fail. According to Wasserman, while
              a certain percentage of these ventures succumb to issues of product or market fit, the
              vast majority meet their end due to people problems.</p>

              to affect change in organizations. Siegel also says you can create room for innovative
              work in an organization by starting new things that the company is currently not
              doing.</p>

                  <p>One of greatest organizational challenges in the nonprofit sector is knowing how well
              you are doing, says Moore Foundation President McCormick, Steven. In a space with
              fewer precise metrics for measuring effectiveness, says McCormick, organizations must
              avoid following into the trap of thinking of success in terms of tactics and
              activities, rather than outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Nonprofits frequently do not have the external drivers necessary to cause required
              change, says Moore Foundation President McCormick, Steven. Sharing a story from a

              versus external concerns.</p>

                  <p>If a nonprofit puts the emphasis on what is solely measurable, it can inadvertently
              cause the organization to do things that are not part of their mission, says
              McCormick, Steven, president of the Moore Foundation. Here McCormick shares a sobering
              example of when an institution measures by the wrong metric.</p>

                  <p>Moore Foundation President McCormick, Steven explains how the unrelenting pressure to
              accept funding can cause an organization to lose operational focus on pursuing their
              mission. Using an example from earlier in his career at The Nature Conservancy,
              McCormick describes how this slippery slope can also inadvertently exacerbate funding
              issues.</p>

                  <p>McCormick, Steven, president of the Moore Foundation, believes an entrepreneur is an
              entrepreneur no matter what sector they are in. However, having seen so many people
              leave nonprofit organizations to become social entrepreneurs, McCormick encourages
              those considering this move to instead try to become a "positive deviant" for change
              inside their current organization.</p>

                  <p>There are lots that computers cannot do, says Cohen, Stephen, co-founder of Palantir
              Technologies. According to Cohen, when computer scientists appreciate the importance

              future relationship between man and machine.</p>

                  <p>Palantir Co-Founder Cohen, Stephen articulates how to approach a deeper understanding
              between knowledge and data that is quantitative versus qualitative in nature.
              Recognizing the depth and subtlety of the qualitative domain, in contrast to what is
              precisely definable, says Cohen, provides scientists and entrepreneurs with a new and
              valuable perspective on solving problems.</p>

                  <p>Using the example of a teacup in an earthquake, researcher Taleb, Nassim explains the
              definition and desired state of fragile systems. Taleb articulates why the opposite of
              fragile is not sturdy or robust, but, in fact, is a concept he refers to as
              antifragile.</p>

                  <p>Author and researcher Taleb, Nassim describes why capturing luck through diligent
              trial and small errors is the actual basis of human innovation, rather than the
              collective knowledge of experts. According to Taleb, convexity matters much more than
              knowledge, when you are faced with randomness and uncertainty.</p>

                  <p>Entrepreneur and Stanford Professor Lam, Monica answers a question on the challenges
              of commercializing research coming out of universities. According to Lam, when
              focusing on larger trends in computing, the fruits of disruptive research frequently
              require longer windows for uptake by industry and consumers.</p>

                  <p>Venture capitalist Mitchell, Kate encourages entrepreneurs to seek out a wide range
              of mentors to gain a full picture of individual strengths and weaknesses. Trust is a
              two-way street when it comes to mentor relationships, says Mitchell, so make it easy
              for mentors to offer feedback and to tell you "the hard thing."</p>

              an attitude of risk-taking, and a sense of humility contribute to Facebook's "stay

                  <p>Goldfein, Jocelyn, director of engineering at Facebook, unpacks the immersive
              experience of new hires at Facebook. New arrivals take part in a six-week "bootcamp,"
              says Goldfein, which helps participants build a immediate connection to their fellow
              employees. Goldfein also explains what they look for in new engineers, including
              coding skills, a collegial attitude, and intuition.</p>

              the true meaning of Facebook's motto: move fast and break things. In just her fifth
              week at the company, Goldfein caused a major problem, but quickly learned that
              Facebook's culture sincerely believes it is every employee's right to take risks.</p>

              to code is one of the best investments you can make. And since young people are at the
              time in life to take a lot of risks, says Goldfein, she urges them to, "not worry
              about what you're going to be when you grow up, just be, and it will come and find
              you." </p>

                  <p>Goldfein, Jocelyn, director of engineering at Facebook, responds to an audience
              question on why her company chooses to centralize its engineering teams in just a few
              locations, with the majority of the workforce being located in Silicon Valley.
              Goldfein explains the reasons for this approach, including the idea that "software
              development is a team sport" that requires working closely in collaborative teams.</p>

                  <p>An overt desire to be associated with successful people has led to an unintentional
              culture of reverence in Silicon Valley, according to entrepreneur Rabinowitz, Matthew.
              To counteract the effects of this issue, Rabinowitz encourages entrepreneurs to be a
              bit irreverent to free yourself from ego and to make better decisions.</p>

                  <p>Cisco Chief Technology and Strategy Officer Warrior, Padmasree explains how the
              process of innovation has changed over the past few centuries, from the era of the
              sole inventor, through the rise of corporate labs, to the modern period of open
              innovation. Warrior also notes the important challenge of working across domains to
              maximize innovation potential.</p>

                  <p>Warrior, Padmasree, Cisco's chief technology and strategy officer, articulates her
              company's framework for growing innovation: build, buy, partner and integrate. While
              elements of the approach may involve occasional challenges of internal alignment, says
              Warrior, the long-term growth and entrepreneurial spirit inside of Cisco is proof of
              the framework's viability.</p>

                  <p>Shopkick Co-Founder Roeding, Cyriac discusses two schools of thought on business
              models. While some entrepreneurs may work hard to find a business model to layer on
              top of a solution, Roeding prefers to find business models that are automatically
              woven into the product or interaction, thus avoiding some of the constant worry over
              monetization.</p>

                  <p>Roeding, Cyriac, co-founder and CEO of Shopkick, believes the execution of culture in
              companies is highly underrated, and that a steady, shared culture provides direction
              for employees who are making small and large decisions all day long. According to
              Roeding, "If you have a strong culture, it blows everyone in a shared direction."</p>

                  <p>According to serial entrepreneur Teig, Steve, using metaphors is a true secret for
              communicating successfully with venture capitalists. "The metaphor is the reality for
              me," says Teig, as it's the best expression of why a solution will work.</p>

                  <p>In response to a question from Ping Li of Accel Partners, Cloudera Co-Founder Olson,
              Mike explains why having a defensible intellectual property strategy is a key for
              long-term growth and sustainability. Without this, says Olson, smaller companies
              eventually stall out, create their own competition through pricing pressures, or
              eventually set themselves up for acquisition.</p>

                  <p>Summary: Rock Health CEO Tecco, Halle argues why healthcare does not exist as a free

              and doctors and providers compensated by volume through fee-for-service models, Tecco
              identifies why changes to the incentive structures are critical for improving
              healthcare in America.</p>

              the power in connecting emotion and "hot causes" to tangible "cool solutions" to
              reduce an individual's focus on pure self-interest.</p>

              Besides counting up acquisitions and the dollar amounts invested in the companies,
              Teitelman says StartX, in keeping with its educational mission, measures the skills
              that founders gain in the accelerator program and the impact of those skills on their
              startup.</p>
