         <head>Description of the Collection</head>
         <p>The interview covers Oliiver' s early life, education, and work experiences at Bell Laboratories and Hewlett-Packard. Oliver began his formal education at Cal ifornia Institute of Technology at the age of fifteen and transferred to Stanford University for his junior and senior years to study electrical engineering with Frederick Terman. There he became associated with William Hewlett and David Packard. After receiving his degree in 1935 he returned to California Institute of Technology for graduate work, from which he joined Bell Laboratories in 1939. His initial assignment there was in the television research group under Axel Hansen. During World War II he worked at Bell on radar. Later he continued his work in television technology and worked with Claude Shannon on information theory. He discusses the organizational climate and objectives at Bell Laboratories in the 1940s and compares it to Hewlett-Packard, which he joined in 1950 as Director of Research. Many aspects of Hewlett-Packard are discussed: vertical integration, distribution of projects, company structure, competitors, associations with Stanford University, mil itary contracts, and recruiting issues. Oliver concludes the interview by discussing his associations with William Hewlett, David Pac kard, and others at Hewlett-Packard Corporation.</p>
