         <p>The Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies is the central forum for interdisciplinary research and teaching in Islamic Studies at Stanford University. It facilitates and promotes the study of Islamic cultures and societies, including the history of Islam from its beginnings to the twenty-first century, systematic study of Islamic social contexts, the religion of Islam in all its internal complexity, and the diversity of human experience as seen in literature and the arts originating in societies affected by Islamic civilizations.</p>
         <p>The Program coordinates and promotes the offering of undergraduate courses and graduate work leading to a Ph.D. in several departments in the School of Humanities and Sciences. It administers student grants for research and advanced language training. The Program also complements Stanford inter-departmental offerings in Islamic Studies by a rich variety of academic conferences, workshops, and public events.</p>
