         <head>Biography</head>
         <p>Born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1913, Gordon Craig immigrated to the United States from Canada
        with his parents at the age of 12. He was educated at Princeton University where, as
        Valedictorian, he received his A.B. in 1936, followed by an M.A. in 1939 and a Ph.D. in
        1941. As a Rhodes Scholar in 1938, he received a B.Litt. from Oxford University. He began
        his teaching career at Yale in 1939, but returned to the Department of History at Princeton
        in 1941.</p>
         <p>During World War II, Dr. Craig worked in Washington as a research associate for the Office
        of Strategic Services and as a divisional assistant for the Special Division of the

        duty in the Central Pacific, Dr. Craig resumed his teaching at Princeton University in 1946.
        In 1950, Dr. Craig received full professorship at Princeton at the age of 37. He was a

        strengthen the Department of History as well as the University's undergraduate and graduate
