         <abstract label="Summary:">These papers consist of photocopies of a diary, 1891 to 1893, and of her letters to her husband written from Pacific Grove, 1898 to 1904; as well as a typescript poem and a copy of her book UNICORNS BROWSING AT DAWN (1942). Subjects covered in the diary include faculty housing on Alvarado, anecdotes on faculty members and administrators, opening day exercises, the popularity of bicycles on campus, and other aspects of the early days of Stanford University. The letters were written while Ellen was staying in Pacific Grove with the children, and some include notes by the children. She writes of their walks and excursions to the beach, the children's health, her writing and reading, and news of university affairs in the press, most notably the Ross affair.</abstract>
