         <p>It was in Warm Springs near San Jose that Leland Stanford first experimented with winemaking in the early 1870s. Originally part of the former Agua Caliente Rancho, the Warm Springs Hotel became a popular resort destination beginning in the mid-1850s. By 1865 over seventy-five acres of French grapes were planted on the property. Stanford purchased the property in 1869 after it had been badly damaged in the earthquake of 1868. The following year Stanford’s brother Josiah moved to Warm Springs and they began experimenting with winemaking. By 1876 the Warm Springs property had over 60,000 fruit bearing vines and the winery was producing about 50,000 gallons of wine per year. In 1886 Leland deeded the Warm Springs property to his brother Josiah who continued to have much success operating the winery. After Josiah’s death in 1890, his son Josiah Winslow Stanford continued on with winemaking, producing approximately 250,000 gallons of wine per year between 1890 and 1900. After changing hands several times in the early twentieth century, the Warm Springs property was eventually sold to the Weibel Wine Company in 1945 who continued to produce wine on site until moving to Woodbridge in the late 1990s.</p>
