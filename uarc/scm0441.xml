         <p>(Russia, Siberia, World War I) 1918 US soldiers in Siberia after the Russian Revolution</p>
         <p>"Order of Siberian Snow Dogs" [American Expeditionary Forces, Siberia] (No place or date, but probably printed in Siberia, circa November 1918) 3 x 5.5 inches, 6pp. Roster of what was apparently a light-hearted social group of 70 of the first American officers and soldiers sent to Siberia two months before the end of World War I, most drafted civilians from all over the US, showing their hometown addresses. One notable military professional on the list was Lt. Col. Philip Faymonville, a Stanford and West Point graduate who was chief Ordnance officer of AEF Siberia, and 15 years later, would become the first US Military Attache to Stalin's Russia. With two original photographs: One, captioned on verso "The Sacred Order of Siberian Snow Dogs/woof! Woof!" 3.5 x 5.5 inches; and a photo of 11 American officers and the Danish Consul, named on verso, and captioned "The Staff, Taken, Dec. 1918, in front of Officers' Quarters, War Prison Camp, Krasnaya Retchka, Siberia". These were undoubtedly some of the first of the 8,000 American officers and men who would eventually be sent to Vladivostok, Siberia between August 1918 and April 1920, not, ostensibly, to intervene in the raging Russian civil war between Bolshevik Reds and the Czarist Whites, but to protect military railroads and supplies. One special unit were the officers of the 29th Infantry shown in the second photograph who took charge of the Krasnaya Retchka POW camp where 2000 captured Germans, most of them officers, were awaiting repatriation to their homeland.</p>
