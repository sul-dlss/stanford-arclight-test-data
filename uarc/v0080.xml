Subjects discussed include intellectual life at Stanford, relationships between male and female students, fraternity life, student activism and protests, the Civil Rights movement, and the 1964 presidential election. Two unnamed students who participated in Stanford's Project South are among the students interviewed. Campus locations in the film include class rooms, the Bookstore, the Computation Center, Tresidder Union, KZSU studio, White Plaza, and the Library. There is also some footage from student rallies at UC Berkeley.</abstract>
