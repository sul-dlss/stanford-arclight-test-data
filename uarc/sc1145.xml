         <p>Frances M. Swain was the wife of Joseph Swain (1857-1927), professor and later president of the University of Indiana, professor of mathematics at Stanford University, and later president of Swarthmore College.</p>

         <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
         <p>Joseph Swain was born in Pendleton, Indiana. He graduated with both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Indiana University. Swain's teaching career began at Indiana University where he served as instructor in mathematics and biology, and eventually he rose to full professor of mathematics. When David Starr Jordan went as president to Leland Stanford University, Swain followed him as professor of mathematics, 1891-1893. He then accepted the invitation to return to Indiana University as president, 1893-1902. Swain was a member of the Quaker faith, and, though successful at Indiana University, he felt a strong impulsion to accept the invitation to Swarthmore College, where he served as president from 1902-1921, when he retired as president emeritus.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
         <p>The materials consist of letters written by Frances [Fannie] M. Swain to members of her family in Indiana</p>
      </scopecontent>
      <scopecontent id="ref8">
         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Fourteen of these letters were written while the Swains were at Stanford, many written on Stanford stationery. Fannie recounts life in California, and mentions that Senator Stanford had invited Prof. Swain to return to Stanford as Vice Priesident after completing his time at Indiana, which he apparently declined. Fourteen letters were written from Edinburgh during 1885-86, during a tenure at the University of Edinburgh, and three from London and Vienna, during later trips abroad.</p>
