Switzer to his brother Albert, written while a student in Chicago (1892-93), at Stanford University (1893-1899), and from Manila, Philippines (1899). His Stanford letters discuss social life of students, disappointment with the library, hard work of hashing at Encina Hall, his bills while at Stanford, his career plans, life in California, difficulties from the 1894 railroad strike, and his military enlistment in 1898. The letters written in Manila primarily relate to his father's estate and his financial affairs with his brother. Other items include receipts for loans from his brother, 1896-1897; Switzer's letter of advice to a young male relative, 1923; letter regarding Switzer's estate, 1937; two letters to Albert Switzer from his brother Charley, 1897; and a letter of reference for Albert Switzer, 1891.</abstract>
