The majority of the photographs in the album are unidentified; subjects include camping trips and other outdoor excursions, Stanford University scenes, ships and boats, Robert Fowler and his biplane, bridge and trestle construction, irrigation set-ups, scenic landscapes, and family and friends. There are also a number of loose photographs; subjects include San Francisco, the "Southern Cross" airplane at the Oakland Airport (1935), Gilbert Jones and William Gabriel working in a lab, and Gov. Johnson in an auto parade. The collection also includes the souvenir booklet PHOTO-GRAVURES OF THE MIDWINTER FAIR [San Francisco], 1894.</abstract>
