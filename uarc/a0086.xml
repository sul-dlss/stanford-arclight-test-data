         <abstract label="Summary:">Three albums of photographs and postcards from his student days at Stanford University. Subjects include fraternity houses (exteriors and interiors), fraternity members, student amusements such as costumed skits and night shirt parades, athletic events (rugby, baseball, boxing, track, and crew), David Starr Jordan in the faculty-senior baseball game, campus buildings, stone carvers working on the Memorial Arch frieze, Salvatierra Street, San Francisquito Creek, and Lake Lagunita. Volume three includes many images of damage from the 1906 earthquake at Stanford and in San Francisco, including the path of the San Andreas faultline in the Stanford hills and the "Camp Stanford" relief station in San Francisco. Also included is a Red Cross relief application card for John O'Grady, May 16, 1906.</abstract>
