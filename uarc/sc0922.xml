         <p>Kenneth M. Cuthbertson graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford in 1940 and returned after his wartime service in the Navy to earn his MBA in 1947. After seven years in the business world, he returned to Stanford in 1954 as assistant to university president J. E. Wallace Sterling. Cuthbertson was named one of the university's first three vice presidents in 1960. With Sterling and Provost Fred Terman, Cuthbertson helped to define Stanford's goals of attracting top faculty, developing programs to meet their needs and finding endowment support. He organized the two largest fund-raising campaigns in the history of American higher education, the PACE (Plan of Action for a Challenging Era) campaign of 1961-64 and the $300 million Campaign for Stanford, which set another new national benchmark in 1972-77. Following his retirement from Stanford in 1977, Cuthbertson served as president of the James Irvine Foundation in San Francisco and Irvine, Calif. He died in 2000.</p>
