         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Referred to as the “Black Book” or “Doomsday Book,” the materials consist of a bound volume of handwritten notes by various Stanford Physics Ph.D. students from 1947-1958. Immediately after completing their oral exams, graduate students would detail their exam questions and experiences (excluding the answers) in the notebook. The volume was passed along to serve as a study guide to other students preparing for their own oral exams who would in turn record their wisdom in the “Doomsday Book.”</p>
         <p>The first entry was created by Emory H. Rogers on October 20, 1947, and according to Perry B. Wilson (Professor Emeritus, SLAC, and Ph.D. Physics 1958), Rogers may be the one who wrote “Doomsday Book” in the notebook’s inside cover. On December 5, 1958, BJ Bjorken wrote the final entry on the book’s last page. Approximately 100 students wrote in the book, and there are about 300 pages in the volume.</p>
