         <p>George Harrington, born in Minnesota in 1883, earned his engineer's degree from the Minnesota School of Mines in 1912. He was a geologist with Standard Oil in Argentina from 1921 to 1943. He retired to Palo Alto in 1943; after the war he became a research associate to Stanford paleontologists Myra Keen and Hans Thalman. His daughter Jane Harrington Jones, Stanford class of 1941, established the George L. Harrington Faculty Scholar Fund in his honor.</p>

         <head>Description of the Collection</head>
         <p>The major part of this collection is two albums of photographs from Harrington's work and travels in Bolivia and Argentina, 1921-1926 and undated. Images include villages, local people, trekking on mountain trails and by river boat, geologic formations, other geologists, oil rigs, and various camps established by the oil company. There is one photo of the Harrington family, ca. 1930. Other papers include a copy of a letter from Harrington written in La Paz, Bolivia, about difficulties with instruments and weather, 1925; a Christmas card with a sketch of the camp at Senillosa; a copy of Harrington's typescript memoirs; and a booklet on the George L. Harrington Faculty Scholar Fund at Stanford University which includes a short biography of Harrington, ca. 1993.</p>
