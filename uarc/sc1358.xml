         <head>Organizational History</head>
         <p>Stanford Says No to War (SSNW) was founded in 2007 by a mix of graduate and undergraduate students who wanted to revive the dwindling antiwar movement on campus. Originally meeting as part of the Coalition for Justice in the Middle East, the founders sought to create a unified, organized stance against the Iraq War. That same year, SSNW’s campaign against Donald Rumsfeld’s appointment as Distinguished Visiting Fellow to the Hoover Institute received widespread news coverage and mass student support. Over 100 students crowded the Associated Students of Stanford University office in a SSNW sponsored demon-tration to pressure the student government to formally stand against the appointment. Today, the group's work continues a legacy of peace activism at Stanford that stems back from the impassioned student protests of the Vietnam War.</p>
