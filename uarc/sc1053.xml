         <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
         <p>Dr. Stephen H. Schneider (1945-2010) was the Melvin and Joan Lane Professor for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies, Professor of Biological Sciences, Professor (by courtesy) of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and a Senior Fellow in the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. Dr. Schneider received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Plasma Physics from Columbia University in 1971. He studied the role of greenhouse gases and suspended particulate material on climate as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1972 and was a member of the scientific staff of NCAR from 1973-1996, where he co-founded the Climate Project.</p>
         <p>Internationally recognized for research, policy analysis and outreach in climate change, Dr. Schneider focused on climate change science, integrated assessment of ecological and economic impacts of human-induced climate change, and identifying viable climate policies and technological solutions. He consulted with federal agencies and/or White House staff in the Nixon, Carter, Reagan, G.H.W. Bush, Clinton and G.W. Bush administrations.</p>
         <p>Actively involved with the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), an initiative of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization since its origin in 1988, Dr. Schneider was co-author of "Uncertainties in the IPCC Third Assessment Report: Recommendations to Lead Authors for More Consistent Assessment and Reporting"in 2000 and the cross-cutting theme paper #4: "Assessing the Science to Address UNFCCC Article 2" in 2004. He has been a contributor to all four IPCC Assessment Reports and is currently a Coordinating Lead Author of Working Group II Chapter 19, "Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and the Risk from Climate Change." For the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), Dr. Schneider has also been a member of the Core Writing Team for each of the Synthesis Reports, which integrate the contributions of Working Groups I, II and III. The 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report will be used by governments world-wide as the most up-to-date, credible document regarding climate change science, impacts, adaptation, vulnerability, and mitigation until 2012. After decades of work, Dr. Schneider, along with four generations of IPCC authors, received a collective Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.</p>
         <p>In 1991, Dr. Schneider was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science/ Westinghouse Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology for furthering public understanding of environmental science and its implications for public policy. In 1992, he was honored with a MacArthur Fellowship for his ability to integrate and interpret the results of global climate research through public lectures, classroom teaching, environmental assessment committees, media appearances, Congressional testimony and research collaboration with colleagues. In 1998, Dr. Schneider became a foreign member of the Academea Europaea, Earth &amp; Cosmic Sciences Section. He was elected to membership in the US National Academy of Sciences in 2002. Dr. Schneider received the Edward T. Law Roe Award of the Society of Conservation Biology in 2003. He and his spouse-collaborator, Terry Root, jointly received the 2003 National Conservation Achievement Award from the National Wildlife Federation and the Banksia Foundation’s 2006 International Environmental Award in Australia.</p>
         <p>Dr. Schneider was Founder and Editor of the interdisciplinary journal, <title render="italic">Climatic Change</title>, Editor-in-Chief of the <title render="italic">Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather and author of The Genesis Strategy: Climate and Global Survival; Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse Century?</title>, and <title render="italic">The Coevolution of Climate and Life and Laboratory Earth: The Planetary Gamble We can't Afford to Lose</title>. In addition, he has authored or co-authored over 400 scientific papers, proceedings, legislative testimonies, edited books and book chapters, and over 200 book reviews, editorials and other pieces for popular media.</p>
         <p>Dr. Schneider taught undergraduate and graduate courses in Earth Systems, Civil Engineering, Biological Sciences, the Senior Honors Seminar in Environmental Science, Technology and Policy, and the doctoral program, The Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Environment and Resources (IPER). He served as Co-Director of the Stanford Center for Environmental Science and Policy (CESP) from 2002 to 2007 and Co-Director of IPER, from 2003 to 2005.</p>
         <p>Dr. Schneider actively counseled policy makers about the importance of using risk management strategies in climate-policy decision making, given the uncertainties in future projections of global climate change and related impacts. In addition to continuing to serve as advisor to decision-makers, he consulted with corporate executives and other stakeholders in industry and the nonprofit sectors regarding possible climate-related events and was actively engaged in improving public understanding of science and the environment through extensive media communication and public outreach.</p>
         <p>Dr. Schneider was a survivor of an aggressive cancer, mantle cell lymphoma. He documented his struggle to conquer the condition, including applying his own knowledge of science to design his own treatment regime, in a self-published 2005 book, <title render="italic">The Patient from Hell</title>. He died unexpectedly on July 19, 2010 after suffering a pulmonary embolism while returning from a scientific meeting in Käringön, Sweden.</p>

               <p>Dr. Schneider was founder and editor of <title render="italic">Climatic Change</title>. The journal is dedicated to the totality of the problem of climatic variability and change – its descriptions, causes, implications and interactions among these. The purpose of the journal is to provide a means of exchange between those working on problems related to climatic variations but in different disciplines. Interdisciplinary researchers or those in any discipline, be it meteorology, anthropology, agricultural science, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, policy analysis, economics, engineering, geology, ecology, or history of climate, are invited to submit articles, provided the articles are of interdisciplinary interest. This means that authors have an opportunity to communicate the essence of their studies to people in other climate related disciplines and to interested laypersons, as well as to report on research in which the originality is in the combinations of (not necessarily original) work from several disciplines. The journal also includes vigorous editorial and book review sections.</p>

                  <p>The Whole Earth Systems symposium is an international gathering of academic, government, media, and non-profit scholars and leaders who have accepted the challenge of an interdisciplinary approach to environmental concerns... We celebrate the professional contributions of Stephen Schneider whose career-thus-far has personally and intellectually touched all of these fields of inquiry.</p>
                  <p>The Stanford symposium was organized into several major themes, such as preserving whole Earth systems, economics and policy analysis, and "media-rology"—the role of scientists as communicators and advocates. Because the conference represented a wide spectrum of expertise, speakers and panelists often used broad brushstrokes to make their point. For example, Stanford economist Kenneth J. Arrow offered a concise history of global sustainability predictions, from Adam Smith to the present, then raised the question of whether the modern world is sustainable.</p>
                  <p>The symposium was sponsored by CESP; the Energy Modeling Forum; the Stanford Institute for the Environment; the New-Land Foundation; the Ju Tang Chu and Wu Ping Chu Foundation; the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance; and anonymous donors.</p>
