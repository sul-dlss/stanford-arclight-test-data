         <p>Philosophy Talk is a talk radio program co-hosted by Stanford professors John Perry and Ken
        Taylor. The program deals both with fundamental problems of philosophy and with the works of
        famous philosophers, especially as these relate to our contemporary, day-to-day lives. Some
        of the wide range of topics of past programs include terrorism, Bush's doctrine of
        pre-emptive self-defense, Descartes, genetic engineering, and virtue. The program airs from
        the studios of KALW, 91.7 FM, Information Radio, San Francisco, California, and is produced
        by Ben Manilla Productions, Inc. on behalf of Stanford University, as part of its Humanities
        Outreach Initiative.</p>
         <p> The show focuses on one topic or famous philosopher for an hour at a time, with an invited
        guest who is an expert on the philosopher or area of philosophy in question. As with most
        philosophical discussions, each show usually provides some factual information about the
        topic, as well as methods and points of view that are helpful in thinking about the topic.
        The Philosophy Talk motto is, "the program that questions everything, except your
        intelligence."</p>

                  <p>Ken and John debate (use?) the insanity defense. What difference does it make if the
              person who commits a crime is, in one way or another, mentally ill? Does this make
              punishment illegitimate? Why is punishment, rather than therapy, ever legitimate?
              Which sorts of mental illness should exempt a criminal from punishment? Inability to
              know right from wrong? Inability to resist compulsion? Irrational depravity?</p>

                  <p>Is there a right and a wrong way to speak English? Is there really something wrong
              with saying, "Hopefully, we'll have a good century?" or "Where is the library at?", or
              "There is no way to correctly split an infinitive." Is grammatical purity just

                  <p>We shouldn't be mean to animals. Is that because animals have rights, like people do?

              put a break to our slide down the slippery slope toward a world in which we license
              physicians to kill or assist the suicide of severely depressed but not terminally ill
              patients?</p>

                  <p>Some psychologists claim to have demonstrated that humans are systematically, deeply
              and perhaps irredeemably irrational in their reasoning and decision making. But what
              is rationality and why does it matter? If we are really so irrational, how have we
              managed to get this far as a species? Maybe rationality isn't such a big deal after
              all. Tune in as Ken Taylor and guest host <extref linktype="simple" href="http://www-philosophy.stanford.edu/fss/nh.html">Nadeem Hussain</extref>

                  <p>Paternalism and Health: Some diseases such as Alzheimer's inhibit our abilities to
              make decisions and lessen our quality of life. In cases like these, we often think
              that others are justified in stepping in and making decisions for that person. But
              what about the case where the person in question is relatively healthy but suffers,
              perhaps, from minor depression, or an anxiety disorder? When (if ever) is it OK to

                  <p>From his theory of the Forms, to his views about morality, justice, and the soul
              Plato was one the greatest and most influential philosophers of all time. Indeed, it
              has been said that all of philosophy is but a footnote to Plato. Find out why as John
              and Ken dig into the philosophical views of Plato, with their guest, Chris Bobonoich,

                  <p>Corporations are recognized as persons in the eyes of the law. But if they are

                  <p>Some feminists hold that there are specially feminine ways of knowing, and the
              current scientific research is flawed for not recognizing them. Some hold that
              philosophy itself is a thoroughly phallocentric enterprise, and deeply flawed. Other
              feminists vigorously reject these views. Join John and Ken as they discuss the
              philosophies of feminism.</p>

                  <p>Time is the most familiar thing in the world, and yet philosophically one of the most
              puzzling. Is the present what's left when you subtract what has already happened, and
              what is yet to happen? Then it seems to vanish into a mere instant.Are future events
              completely unreal? Or are they just the things we can't know yet? Is time unreal, as
              many philosophers have thought? Columbia's Dave Albert joins John and Ken for a

                  <p>Is love just a (second-hand) emotion? Is it a feeling? A disparate group of feelings,
              glandular responses, and ill-considered commitments condensed into a single word so
              that poets will have something to write about?A poor substitute for true friendship
              imposed upon us by lust? Or the deepest and most satisfying of human conditions?</p>

                  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act recognizes that people with disabilities are
              often prevented from leading productive and satisfying lives because social, school
              and work environments are often thoughtlessly and unnecessarily designed with only
              people with the standard set of abilities in mind. In manycases"reasonable
              accommodation" to the ways people with disabilities need to do things is required.
              What is reasonable? Elevators in schools? Probably. How about elevators in the Grand
              Canyon?What is a disability? Blindness? Certainly. How about obesity? Where do we draw
              lines, and on what principles?</p>

              the context of a secular state?Committed believers may want the policies of the
              stateto reflect their deeply heldreligious convictions and values.Committed
              non-believers may notwant the state imposing religiously inspired values in the
              absence of any purely secular justification.Must religion retreat from the public
              sphere or can religion find a place in the public sphere, even in a purely secular
              state?</p>

                  <p>Progress in neuroscience may soon make possible an age of neurocosmetology: the use
              of drugs to let people affect the way their brains work, so as to make them more
              effective, more attractive, and more like their "cognitive ideal."A world where all
              the women are beautiful and all the men handsome might be bearable if boring. But
              would a society full of type-A's work at all?Can it be rational to choose to change in
              ways that may change who you are? Should there be moral or legal prohibitions against
              healthy people messing with their own brain chemistry?</p>

                  <p>Is the human mind a relatively inflexible program bequeathed to us by evolution, and
              culture just a veneer that gives age-old urges a respectable cover? Or our minds
              largely the product of language, culture, and civilization, with evolution having
              supplied only the most basic hardware and operating system? John and Ken welcome Leda
              Cosmides to shed some light on the human mind.</p>

                  <p>Where would we be without emotions? Many philosophers throughout history have thought
              the emotions serve only to cloud our judgments and actions. Phrases like "He's just
              acting emotionally" or "Her judgment is clouded by emotion" are phrases of
              condemnation, not of praise. Still, some philosophers have argued the emotions have an
              intelligence of their own and that the emotions are indispensable for our ethical
              lives. Join John and Ken and their guest Martha Nussbaum as they explore the role of
              emotions in well lived lives and well-order societies.</p>

                  <p>Some actions are right, and some are wrong. But aren't some even better than
              right---the kinds of things that heroes and saints do? Yet some philosophers think
              that such "supererogatory" acts make no sense; we should always do the best thing open

                  <p>Politics, especially American politics, puts pressure on words like "liberal",

                  <p>After World War II the Nurenberg trials and the conventions that arose out of them
              codified the idea that there are right and wrong ways to wage war. That prisoners of
              war have definite rights, and that non-combatants should be treated differently that
              soldiers. Some think the idea of a morality of warfare makes no sense, and that the
              distinction between soldiers and non-combatants is meaningless in the setting of
              modern warfare. John and Ken discuss these issues in the light of philosophical
              theories of right and wrong.</p>

                  <p>Quantum mechanics is an astoundly successful, mathematically elegant, explanatorily
              deep, even beautiful scientific theory. Yet it reveals a truly puzzling world of
              micro-entities: entities that can be at two places at once, that can "travel" from
              here to the other side of Alpha Centauri in an instant without traversing the space in
              between, that behave like waves when unobserve but like particles when observed. Join
              John, Ken and their guest,Jenann Ismael as they try to make philosophical sense of the
              strange world of quantum reality.</p>

              play as South Africa makes the tumultuous transition to a post-apartheid democracy.
              How has the new South Africa constructed its concepts of reconciliation? How has its
              historical emergence meant a rethinking, reimaging, re-experiencing, relabeling, and
              repoliticizing of race? John and Ken discuss reconciliation with Daniel Herwitz, a

                  <p>Berkeley founded and defended idealism; the doctrine that there is not a material

                  <p>Who do we call friends? Do we need friends out of love for others or for ourselves?
              Is a life with friends necessarily a better life? Ancient philosophers, such as

                  <p>Does the value of preserving our environment conflict with the development of a world
              community in which all enjoy the fruits of human progress? Is the environment
              important intrinsically, or only as a source of pleasure and other goods for human

                  <p>Is there any reason to think the cause or causes of order in the universe bear an
              even remote analogy to human intelligence? Even if they did, would that mean these
              intelligent causes had the benevolence and sense of justice required of a Christian
              God? Is this whole issue one of science, religion, or philosophy? These questions,
              considered by Hume, have now become the focus of a national debate. The philosophers
              discuss intelligent design with Daniel Dennett, Director of the Center for Cognitive
              Studies at Tufts University, author of books on consciousness, evolution, and
              freedom.</p>

                  <p>Is philosophy the queen of the sciences, with the job of synthesizing, interpreting
              and evaluating the results of the particular sciences? Or should we adopt John Locke's

              and assumptions? During the twentieth century the discipline of the philosophy of
              science emerged as a central part of philosophy. Ken and John discuss some of the
              leading ideas and projects involved in this branch of philosophy.</p>

                  <p>The Philosophers discuss the life and ideas of W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963).
              Sociologist, historian, philosopher, editor, writer, and activist, he was one of the
              most influential intellectuals of the twentieth century. The first African-American
              Ph.D. from Harvard University, Du Bois died in Ghana after having renounced his
              American citizenship. In between he co-founded the NAACP and wrote The Souls of Black
              Folk (1903) as well as a number of other influential books that had a decisive impact
              on the development of African-American culture in the twentieth century.</p>

                  <p>Monogamy is traditional in most cultures, and it is the law throughout America since
              Utah gave up polygamy to acquire statehood. Is there any philosophical basis for
              favoring monogamy over polygamy? Or any reasons grounded in clear empirical facts or
              social needs? With a looming shortage of females relative to males in large parts of
              Asia, is it time to question this traditional assumption about marriage?</p>

                  <p>Being funny isn't easy. Figuring out what makes things funny is even harder. Still, a
              number of psychologists (e.g., Freud) and philosophers (e.g., Bergson) have tried. Now
              computer scientists are trying to learn enough about humor to construct programs that
              can write good jokes; maybe an artificial stand-up comedian is on the way. Ken and

                  <p>Basketball, an American invention but a world-wide phenomenon, is sometimes
              characterized as the most athletic and aesthetic of sports. What makes a sport
              interesting? Valuable? Fun? Entertaining? What values does sport exemplify, and does
              basketball really measure up? Does commercialization undermine the values of sport?
              Ken and John discuss the philosophy of basketball with Frank Deford, one of America's
              premier sportswriters.</p>

                  <p>The pursuit of truth is often thought to be "intrinsically" valuable. Scientists and
              philosophers, who eschew religious rationales for their life's work, take the pursuit
              of truth to be obviously a worthwhile enterprise. But what's so great about truth?
              Sure, it's good to know what's for lunch, or the nature of the disease that plagues
              you, but is there any intrinsic or instrumental value in knowing how far away the
              farthest stars are? Or whether Milton's greatest works were written while he had a
              headache? Or what the next layer of basic particles are like? Truth telling on

                  <p>Philosophical conceptions of justice have most often been directed at the nature of a
              just state. But many contemporary issues of justice reach across boundaries. Are our
              immigration policies fair and just? Can a just state invade another state in order to
              outfit it with a more just government? Can we defend economic policies that improve
              the lives of our citizens but an adverse impact on economies abroad?</p>

                  <p>A lot of our thinking, and even our perception, has to do not only with what is, but
              what might be, and what would have been. That is, the imagination is an important part
              of our intellectual life. And learning to use our imaginations without losing sight of
              reality is part of growing up. What is the imagination, and what led Mother Nature to
              make it such an important part of our make-up? John and Ken discuss the imagination

                  <p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is without doubt one of the most influential
              philosophers of all time. He has, however, been largely ignored by American "analytic"
              philosophers of the twentieth century. John and Ken don't know nearly as much about
              Hegel and his philosophy as they should. They will be lively if somewhat obtuse

              philosophy, when Philosophy Talk goes to the bookshelf and pulls down the big volumes
              of Hegel's collected works.</p>

                  <p>People who don't seem affected by emotions are often called "stoic." But there's a
              lot more to Stoicism than simply being unaffected. Stoicism dates back to ancient
              Greece and Rome and offers a comprehensive approach to living life. Who were the
              original Stoics? What were their arguments? And is being stoic a good idea? John and
              Ken delve deep into Stoicism in this episode with John Cooper from Princeton
              University.</p>

                  <p>The concept of equality is as important to America's self-conception as it is
              confusing. What sort of equality? Equality before the law; equality of opportunity;
              equal access to all the benefits of modern society? If we treat everyone the same, how
              can we take account of inequities due to race, class, gender and other factors? Guest

                  <p>Edward Gibbon and James Madison both noted how liberties in Rome were among the
              victims of its growing empire. Is our society facing a similar problem, given what
              some public figures have said about choosing between how much liberty and how much
              security we want? Or is this a false choice put forward by those in power? John and
              Ken take a philosophical lens to the relationship between liberty and security.</p>

              suggests that some things are worse than others. How do we disentangle what's fair

                  <p>Rabbis and Talmudic scholars have spent centuries puzzling over theology, texts, and
              life. In the process they came up with many philosophical ideas that have inspired the
              work of more recent philosophers such as Martin Buber and Emmanuel Levinas. Who or

                  <p>Karl Popper is a landmark figure in the philosophy of science.  His notion of
              "falsifiability" endures to this day and even appears in arguments about creation
              versus evolution.  But what does it mean for a theory to be falsifiable? And where
              does the idea stand in contemporary philosophy of science?  John and Ken test a few
              ideas on Popper and falsifiability with Denis Phillips from Stanford University.</p>

                  <p>You might think our thought simply determine what we say. But maybe the language we
              speak is what really determines the thoughts we can have. As Wittgenstein famously
              wrote, "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." And Benjamin Lee Whorf
              held that the language you speak has a systematic influence on how you think about and
              interact with reality. John and Ken wrestle with the relationship between language and
              thought with Lera Boroditsky from Stanford University.</p>

                  <p>Some have argued that there aren't any good arguments for believing in God. Is belief
              in God just an act of faith without reason? Plenty of philosophers would disagree. Why
              are philosophers so divided on the matter? In this episode Ken and John discuss the
              rational arguments for believing in God.</p>

                  <p>In America, there's not just one governing body, there are three: executive,
              legislative, and judicial. You might think that separating those powers is just less
              efficient. But the founding fathers put a lot of philosophical thought into coming up
              with a system of checks and balances. In this episode, John and Ken discuss the
              separation of powers with Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan in front of a live
              audience on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.</p>

                  <p>A scary dream brings all the fears that a scary real situation can, and a happy dream
              can make us feel truly happy. But what are dreams? Where do they come from? And why do
              they feel so real? Thinkers from Descartes to Freud have been fascinated by dreams and
              their philosiphical significance. Join John and Ken as they explore one of the mind's
              greatest mysteries.</p>

                  <p>Back in the middle ages, people thought of children simply as little adults. Modern
              psychology has destroyed that theory. But then, what is a child? How are their minds

                  <p>Pragmatism is perhaps America's most distinctive contribution to philosophy.
              Developed by Pierce, Dewey, and James in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
              pragmatism holds that both the meaning and the truth of any idea is a function of its
              practical outcome. The pragmatists rejected all forms of absolutism and insisted that
              all principles be regarded as working hypotheses that must bear fruit in lived
              experience. Join John and Ken as they dig into this intellectually vibrant, still
              influential, and distinctly American philosophical tradition.</p>

                  <p>Philosophers have always been concerned with the mind. What is consciousness?
              Representation? Emotion? Now that neuroscience is making headway on these same
              questions, we should ask: how should philosophy and neuroscience relate? John and Ken

                  <p>Despite the crass commercialism that drives the production of many movies, there's no
              doubt that film is a distinctive and distinctively powerful art form. Cinematic

                  <p>Lawyers are often thought to be hardly better than hired guns, who, in the words of
              Plato, are paid to "make the weaker argument the stronger" -- like the sophists of
              old. In fact, lawyers are legally and morally bound by stringent codes of ethics.
              Noted philosopher of law David Luban, of Georgetown University, is the guest as
              Philosophy Talk explores the ethical obligations of lawyers to their clients, to the
              court, and to society at large.</p>

                  <p>Everywhere we look -- in the media, in our political campaigns, in the hallowed halls
              of the academy -- we are confronted with an endless stream of BS, spin, propaganda,
              half-truths, and even outright lies. Yet for centuries, philosophers have argued that
              the pursuit of truth is both intrinsically good and instrumentally useful. But if
              truth is really both good and useful, then why is there so much BS around? John and

                  <p>In the Early Modern period many philosophers took ideas to be mental images of the
              objects they stood for. During the 20th century, that notion fell into considerable
              disrepute. Yet recent cognitive science has revived the idea that at least some of our
              mental representations are highly imagistic in character, not just mental
              representations tied to vision and perception generally. Join John, Ken, and noted
              cognitive psychologist Lera Boroditsky of Stanford University to explore the imagistic
              nature of mental representations.</p>

                  <p>In many democracies, the judiciary is protected, to one degree or another, from the
              voters.  Our federal judges, for example, though appointed by elected officials, then
              have lifetime tenure.  In more local venues, however, many judges are directly
              elected.  What is the role of the judiciary in a democracy, and how much protection
              from democratic processes is needed?  John and Ken probe the judiciary branch of
              government with Larry Kramer, Dean of the Stanford Law School.</p>

                  <p>People have strong but divergent opinions about the nature of animals' minds. Do dogs

              providing food. Could it be that whales, dolphins, elephants, and various kind of
              monkeys have mental lives that approach -- or surpass -- those of humans in subtlety
              and richness? John and Ken explore thenature of non-human minds with guest Colin Allen

              it go beyond what science can explain? Join John, Ken, and their guest, Joseph Levine
              from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as they probe the limits of scientific

                  <p>Freedom of speech tells us the government shouldn't restrict the journalist. But
              should anything restrict the journalist? Should the duty to inform be limited by the
              duty not to betray national security, not to injure the innocent, not to corrupt the
              jury pool, and similar considerations? How do we draw the line? John and Ken welcome

                  <p>Science is, on the one hand, a huge enterprise funded to a great extent by the
              government and by industry. On the other hand, science is supposed to be the
              dispassionate, objective search for truth. What happens when the search for truth
              conflicts with the needs and desires of the funders? Should those funders be allowed
              to censor the science they pay for? Should scientists be free to publish the truth
              whatever its effect? John and Ken welcome Ronald Atlas, Past President of the American
              Society for Microbiology and Graduate Dean at the University of Louisville.</p>

                  <p>At least some versions of artificial intelligence are attempts not merely to model

              certain way, by walking a certain way? Is flirtatious behavior culturally relative?
              Could you flirt with a robot? With your own long-term partner? With an idea? Join John

                  <p>In art, architecture, music, film, literature, sociology, communications, fashion and
              philosophy there is a contrast between "the modern" and "the post-modern." But just
              what are the main hallmarks of the postmodern? How does the "postmodern" differ from
              the "modern?" Is the postmodern an improvement over the modern? John and Ken are
              joined by Gary Aylesworth, Professor of Philosophy at Eastern Illinois University, to
              explore the contours of postmodernism in philosophy, literature, and art.</p>

                  <p>An art lover will argue that art brings beauty to our surroundings and provides
              occasions for intellectual and emotional reflection. But those who don't appreciate
              art see it as unnecessary and frivolous - at any rate, certainly not something that
              tax dollars should go to support. In a time when school budgets for art programs are
              dwindling, John and Ken are joined by Cynthia Freeland, Chair of the Philosophy
              Department at the University of Houston, to ask the critical question: what is the
              value of art?</p>

                  <p>For Plato, love and philosophy were closely related. Love of beauty causes one to
              contemplate the whole sea of beauties, including beautiful systems of justice and
              beautiful scientific theories. But Plato wasn't such a fan of poetry, arguing that it
              merely evoked strong emotions in a way contrary to reason. Noted poet Troy Jollimore,
              winner of the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award, disagrees. He joins John and
              Ken for a spirited discussion of love, poetry, and philosophy, recorded in front of a
              live audience at Powell's City of Books in Portland, Oregon.</p>

                  <p>Does faith obscure reason? Does reason obscure faith? Or perhaps their subject
              matters are different. Faith might address one area of our lives and reason and
              science another. Faith may allow us to see meaning, values, and God, while reason sees
              everything else, whatever that may be. Or perhaps faith and reason are fundamentally
              intertwined. Is faith void of reason? Is it irrational to be faithful? Are science and
              rationality void of faith? John and Ken welcome Nancey Murphy, author ofDid My Neurons
              Make Me Do It?: Philosophical and Neurobiological Perspectives on Moral Responsibility

                  <p>People who predict the future well are sometimes said to be psychic. But we all make
              predictions about the future, with more or less success. We confidently predict the
              sun will rise tomorrow, that ice will be cold, etc. But maybe we're not quite as good
              at predicting the future as we think. Is the stock market predictable? The weather?
              Political upheavals? Or is life just too random to make good predictions? John and Ken
              predict that Nassim Taleb, author of The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly

                  <p>What can we learn from studying philosophy? What can we learn from reading great (or
              not-so-great) literature? Some philosophers and literary theorists believe that
              philosophy and literature converge in a number of places. Great literature is often
              deeply philosophical, and great philosophy is often great literature, sometimes in the
              form of fictional narrative. Perhaps we can learn many of the same lessons from
              philosophy and literature. Can the methods of philosophy and literary criticism be
              combined? Are the truths they shed light upon complementary? John and Ken are joined

                  <p>What is political correctness? Has it always existed? What's "political" about it?
              Some people think that concerns over being PC lead to censorship and the stifling of
              free debate. Others think the label "politically correct" is nothing but a demeaning
              term for values we should espouse anyway, like appropriateness, politeness, fairness,
              and respectfulness. Is "politically correct" just a nasty label used to diminish and
              belittle social progress? Or do the assailants of political correctness have a point?
              John and Ken take on political correctness with former political speechwriter Leonard
              Steinhorn, Professor of Communication at American University.</p>

                  <p>What does "God" mean? Is God a concrete thing like a chair or a human; or is it an
              abstract thing, like love or goodness? Is there something that all concepts of God

                  <p>A paradox is a persuasive argument that something, which we judge must be false, is
              true. Zeno's Paradox, for example, is a convincing argument that it's impossible to
              move. Paradoxes are valuable in philosophy because they help us become aware of forms
              of argument that are deceptively convincing yet logically fallacious. John and Ken are

                  <p>Does the human mind work like a computer? If so, what kind of computer? A theory
              known as connectionism offers a revolutionary perspective on these issues. Ken and

              University, an architect of the connectionist view.</p>

                  <p>Infinity is a puzzling concept. Mathematicians say there are as many odd numbers as
              there are numbers altogether. That seems like saying there are as many men as there
              are people altogether which we know is untrue. And if you subtract infinity from
              infinity, you are still left with infinity but which infinity? Some infinities are
              larger than others how can this be? John and Ken unravel the paradoxes of infinity

                  <p>Hannah Arendt was one of the most original and influential philosophers of the 20th
              century. Her work considered historical and contemporary political events, such as the
              rise and fall of Nazism, and drew conclusions about the relation between the
              individual and society. Seyla Benhabib,Professor of Political Science and Philosophy
              at Yale University and Director of its Program in Ethics, Politics and Economics,
              joins John and Ken discuss Arendt's political philosophy and its enduring

                  <p>John Rawls was one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth
              century. In his book <extref linktype="simple"

                Justice</extref> he articulated a concept of justice as fairness, which won many
              fans among liberals, and provoked important responses from thoughtful libertarians
              such as Robert Nozick. Ken and John discuss the life and ideas of John Rawls with

                  <p>Is a university a research institute with students, or and educational institution
              with research around the edges or something in between? To whom does the university
              answer the trustees? The administration? The faculty? The students? Or something more

                  <p>Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King all engaged in civil disobedience, and are
              widely admired for doing so. But how can democratic society function if each person's
              conscience has to be satisfied for a law to be obeyed? When is civil disobedience
              justified? When is it required? How does the concept fit with the great ethical and
              political philosophies? John and Ken discuss the ethics of protest and punishment with
              Kimberley Brownlee from the University of Manchester.</p>

                  <p>Why do we do what we do? To please others? To live up to what culture expects? Or for
              our own reasons as "autonomous agents"? Americans tend to admire (at least in theory)
              the autonomous individual, the person who knows what he wants, and sets out to get it,
              no matter what the world might think. Is this true of all cultures? John and Ken are

                  <p>Many people identify strongly with the ethnic or racial group to which they belong as
              Jews, or African-Americans, or Latinos. But to which groups does a person truly
              belong? President Obama has a white mother from Kansas and an African father from
              Kenya. Why is he seen as our first African-American President, rather than our
              forty-fourth white president? How does racial identity work? Is such identification a
              positive or a negative factor in a person's life? Must we choose among our potential
              identities? Ken and John discuss racial and bi-racial identity with Michele Elam from

                  <p>We seem to be able to decide our behavior for ourselves what we do is up to us. But
              if everything that we do can be explained by physics, does this leave room for
              freedom? Are all of our actions pre-determined? Are we slaves to fate? Is freedom
              compatible with determinism, or does science teach us that we're nothing but complex
              machines, following out a complicated program that a good enough physicist could have
              predicted centuries ago? And what are the implications for morality and
              responsibility? John and Ken exercise their will with Manuel Vargas from the

              Napster to YouTube, some of our most innovative and inventive young people have been
              the targets of lawsuits by entertainment industry lawyers for violating copyright
              laws. What are the ideas behind copyright protection? What is the philosophical and
              practical basis of copyright? Can rethinking the issues suggest the form of a truce
              between generations? Ken and John sample the copyright debate with Larry Lessig,

                  <p>Money makes the world go around. But what sort of thing is money? Bits of paper and

                  <p>There are two ways to have your desires fulfilled: you can either get what you want
              (if you're lucky enough) or change your desires. If we can fit our desires to what we
              have, we're likely to be a lot happier. So why do we desire things that are out of

                  <p>Worship is the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for something. The
              attitude of worship towards God or gods or ancestors is a universal of human culture.
              But why do we worship? Do objects of worship need to fulfill certain criteria? Does
              worship play a positive or negative role in human culture? Is it clear that a perfect,
              omnipotent and omniscient God truly wants to be worshipped? Some pagan religions
              worship the earth, or the aspects of nature that make human life possible and
              rewarding. Does this make more sense than worshipping an imperfect God? The
              Philosophers express their reverence with Daniel Speak from Loyola Marymount
              University.</p>

                  <p>As of June 30, 2007, the prisons and jails in the land of the free held 2,299,116
              inmates; one in every 31 American adults is in prison, on parole, or on probation. The
              state of California has more people in jail than China does, and this year expects to
              spend more on prisons than on higher education. Is something wrong with this picture?

                  <p>Does our system of credit and money make upward social mobility possible for anyone
              willing to work hard? Or is it just a big Ponzi scheme? Are corporations the essential
              structures necessary to harness the capital, energy, intelligence, and leadership on a
              scale large enough to make and market the inventions that define modern life? Or are

                  <p>Do we have a right to healthcare, and to good high quality healthcare, in any precise
              and defensible sense? Or is the "right to healthcare" just a nice way to say it would
              be very nice if everyone had healthcare? Ken and John take a philosophical lens to the
              alleged right to healthcare and health insurance with Laurence Baker from the Center
              for Health Policy at Stanford University.</p>

                  <p>Some people think Jesus was the son of God, though many who are skeptical about that

                  <p>The ancients believed in an enchanted universe a universe suffused with meaning and

                  <p>We base many decisions every day not only on the belief that other people have minds,
              but on detailed beliefs about what is going on in those minds: what these other people
              believe, feel, hope, and fear. The basis of our ability to "read" the minds of others
              is a lively area of research in psychology and the philosophy of psychology. Ken and
              John discuss mind-reading with Shaun Nichols from the University of Arizona, author of

                  <p>Movies play a large role in modern life. We enjoy watching them; we idolize the
              actors and actresses who appear in them; we analyze the directors. But how well do
              movies tackle bigger philosophical questions? With the help of listeners, John and Ken

              the past year.</p>

                  <p>Fear is an emotion, but it is one with a long history in both political theory and
              politics in the real world. In many versions of social contract theory, it is a fear
              of the state of nature that leads to government in the first place. From McCarthy to
              post-9/11 politics, fear has played a leading role in American public discourse. Ken

                  <p>According to former Vice President Cheney, practices widely regarded as torture
              prevented further attack on America after 9/11. The facts are in dispute. But suppose

                  <p>It's a Philosophy Talk highlight reel for the membership drive! In this special
              episode, John and Ken relive some favorite moments from Philosophy Talk episodes
              recorded in front of live audiences around the country. We start at the Marsh theatre
              in San Francisco with psychologist Alison Gopnik and political philosopher Judith
              Butler, followed by philosopher-poet Troy Jollimore in Portland, pop culture
              philosopher Richard Hanley at the University of Delaware, scientist and entrepreneur
              Craig Venter at the Smithsonian Institution, and political scientist Rob Reich in Palo
              Alto, California. Plus selected commentaries from Ian Shoales, the Sixty-Second
              Philosopher.</p>

                  <p>The Supreme Court recently decided that corporations had the right of free speech
              under the U.S. Constitution, since they are persons. But what does it mean to say
              corporations are persons? Why should they have rights? If they have free speech,

                  <p>According to the Declaration of Independence, the basic human rights of life, liberty

                  <p>Our founding fathers believed that a free press would serve democracy by promoting
              unfettered political debate and expose the actions of the government to the harsh
              scrutiny of an informed and engaged populace. Today, however, large media
              conglomerates have become part of the entrenched power structure and are driven as
              much by profit as by a sense of public mission. Is it still possible to believe that
              the press lives up to the lofty ideals of our founding fathers? John and Ken are

                  <p>Socrates was executed for corrupting the youth. In America, youth below college age
              are usually not exposed to philosophy in the classroom. Is philosophy all that
              dangerous? Should it be taught to teenagers? Or would this lead to a generation of
              self-absorbed and skeptical young people, shirking their duties in order to worry
              about the meaning of life? John and Ken are joined by Jack Bowen, author of <title render="italic">The Dream Weaver</title> and <title render="italic">If You Can Read
                This: The Philosophy of Bumper Stickers</title>, for a program recorded with a live

                  <p>The American Revolution was saturated with meaning and ambiguity, from the words of
              the Declaration of Independence, to the beliefs of the founding fathers, to the

              Sure, John and Ken are from Stanford, but many of our most frequent and most brilliant

                  <p>Compromise is the condition of peace and progress. But there are times when we should
              not compromise when compromise would undermine integrity and amount to cooperating
              with evil. How do we distinguish between when are we 'bargaining with the devil' and
              when are we simply trying to be tolerant of alternative lifestyles and political
              positions? Is it OK to 'bargain with the devil' in the name of peace? When we refuse
              to compromise on moral grounds, are we imposing our values? Ken and John negotiate the
              terms with UC Irvine Law Professor and professional mediator Carrie Menkel-Meadow.</p>

                  <p>The occult is routinely dismissed in our times as the province of quacks, the
              irrational, and the superstitious. But during the Renaissance, many of the best minds
              in Europe studied the philosophy and science of the occult. The period witnessed an
              outpouring of systematic philosophical and scientific treatises on the occult.
              References to the occult pervade the works of Shakespeare and other literary writers
              of the time. Many scholars believe that The Occult Philosophy and the Occult Sciences,
              with their search for hidden causes, played a decisive role in the rise of modern
              science. In this special Halloween week episode, John and Ken delve into Occult
              Philosophy with Christopher Lehrich from Boston University, author of <title render="italic">The Occult Mind: Magic in Theory and Practice.</title>

                  <p>Reading is a lot of fun, especially narrative fiction everyone loves a good story.
              But maybe there's more to it than that. Maybe everyone is, or at least tries to be, a
              good story themselves. Perhaps our very personal identities rest on narratives we form
              about ourselves, narratives that give our lives meaning, continuity, and coherence.
              Will the younger generation fashion lives based on the chaos and violence-based levels

                  <p>Human thought is an amazing thing. It has given us not only science, literature, and
              morality, but also superstition, slavery, and war. Thought has the power to uncover

                  <p>We live in a market-driven society our day-to-day lives consist of buying and selling
              goods and services, and to some, our ability to do so without government regulation is
              the underpinning of democratic freedom itself. Everything has a price, and pretty much
              everything is for sale, from concert tickets to political influence. But should it be

                  <p>Nothing stirs up controversy like abortion. To some, it carries the steep moral cost
              of destroying human life, while to others, it represents an inviolable bastion of
              women s rights over their own bodies. Despite the polarizing nature of the debate, it
              covers broad philosophical ground, and touches on religious, political, social and
              moral considerations. Ken and John seek a dispassionate and rational discussion of

                  <p>Jacques Derrida was one of the most influential and also one of the most polarizing
              philosophers of the twentieth century. With his method of "deconstruction," Derrida
              provided critiques not only of literary trends and philosophical ideas but also
              political institutions. He won many followers among humanists, but analytical
              philosophers tended to be skeptical that Deconstructionism was anything more than a
              fancy name for a mÃ©lange of half-understood ideas. John and Ken take on Derrida and

                  <p>Everyone procrastinates academics are especially prone to it. But why do we
              procrastinate? Is it lack of will-power? Or is procrastination more like a disease,
              something that might be cured? Can we structure our priorities in such a way so as to
              accomplish more even while procrastinating? John and Ken can no longer put off the

              ever lived, without any exception. &#x9d; Many debates in modern political theory have

              issues, particularly identity and selfhood, have also influenced generations of

                  <p>We've all heard a disenchanted teenager claim that everything is relative and that
              there is no absolute morality or truth. Of course, there seems to be something wrong
              with that; isn't the relativity of everything then an absolute? Relativism has
              appeared throughout philosophy since the ancient Greek Sophists. Proponents of
              relativism argue that some central element of thought, experience, evaluation, or even
              reality is somehow relative to something else. Does that mean that we merely obey a
              code that has no inherent value? John and Ken avoid absolutes with Paul Boghossian

              situated in an environment. According to some, in fact, the body and the environment
              do not just house the mind, but are an essential part of the mind in the sense that
              workings of the mind depend upon and exploit the body and the environment. John and

                  <p>State-sanctioned marriage has long been regarded as one of the bedrocks of a stable
              society. But in recent times, this venerable institution has become the focus of
              intense debate, as those long denied the right to marry clamor to be let in and those
              determined to keep marriage the way it's always been threaten to amend the
              constitution in defense &#x9d; of marriage. In the heat of battle, few have stopped to ask
              whether the state should be in the marriage business in the first place until now.

                  <p>In the 1960s, as many American cities burst and burned, the upper and middle classes
              fled to the suburbs, leaving behind a decaying infrastructure and a socially isolated
              urban underclass. In more recent times, many urban centers have undergone
              re-gentrification, and with it the return of the upper classes, safer neighborhoods,
              and better services. But gentrification often drives poor and working class people
              from the very places they had called home. Is gentrification on balance a morally and
              socially good thing or bad thing? Does it serve more to increase inequality or to
              lessen the isolation of the urban underclass? John and Ken assess the moral cityscape

                  <p>In the 18th and 19th Century, philosophers and intellectuals were immersed in
              politics and popular culture. Even in the early 20th Century some of the leading
              academic figures of the time, like Betrand Russell, also wrote for a broader public.
              Where have the public philosophers and public intellectuals gone? Can philosophers and
              intellectuals still speak to a broad public? If they speak will the public listen? Or
              is the public intellectual a thing of the past? John and Ken contemplate the place of
              the public intellectual in the modern world with Hans Gumbrecht, author of<extref linktype="simple"

                  <p>Quantum physics is regarded by many as the most powerful predictive theory science
              has produced. But there is no interpretation of what the theory means that all
              knowledgeable scientists and philosophers agree on. For example, quantum mechanics
              delivers no very clear message about the difference between past, present and future.

                  <p>America's elite colleges and universities spend millions of dollars to generate

                  <p>Social psychologists have discovered that our self-images play a surprising role in
              our thinking about everyday moral matters. People who feel they have already proven
              themselves to be morally good feel less pressure to do the right thing than someone
              whose moral credentials are still in question. And people often resent, rather than
              applaud, the morally admirable actions of others if those actions threaten their own
              sense of moral adequacy. John and Ken explore the surprising ways in which our own
              self-images influences our moral evaluations and reasoning with Stanford psychologist

                  <p>Religions rely on miracles to demonstrate the authenticity of figures thought to have
              supernatural powers. Many people feel that key events in their lives were literally
              miracles. Many even claim to have witnessed miracles. But what counts as a miracle? Is
              it true, as Hume argued, that it is always more rational to disbelieve the testimony
              of a miracle than to believe in the miracle itself? John and Ken explore what miracles
              are, and what would constitute good reasons for believing in them, with Peter Graham
              from the University of California Riverside.</p>

                  <p>Tribal societies lived in a world of the sacred and profane, ritual and taboo. Is
              there anything left of this structure in the modern world? Is anything really taboo,
              or are things just inadvisable, problematic, unhealthy, unwise, and less than optimal
              under the circumstances? John and Ken consider what, if anything, is still sacred with

                  <p>Is the military draft a natural expression of democratic values, or a challenge to
              our most basic concepts of individual rights and liberties? Are the values that make
              for an effective military consistent with the values that make for a free and
              democratic republic? If the government must have the power to defend the nation, does
              it follow that it must have the power to control events around the entire world? John

                  <p>At least forgive OR forget. Get things behind you. All good advice for those who
              don't want their life dominated by the bad things that have happened to them at the
              hands of others. This advice has also been applied to aggrieved populations following
              liberating reforms and revolutions, as in South Africa. But what is forgiveness? What
              are its limits? Does it make sense to forgive those who attempt genocide, for example?
              Does forgiveness entail a sacrifice of pride and dignity? John and Ken let bygones be
              bygones with their guest, Paul Hughes from the University of Michigan-Dearborn.</p>

                  <p>Americans value democracy, and expect others to value it. But is it a universal
              value? Does God, or rationality, or something very basic about human sensibility,
              dictate that states should be organized democratically? What if there were empirical
              evidence that some non-democratic form of government is more likely to produce human
              happiness, cultural achievement, and sound money? John and Ken consider the
              universality of democratic values with Larry Diamond, Senior Fellow at the Hoover

                  <p>Along with the blockbusters, summer is a great time to catch up on some of the
              deepermovies you may have missed over the past year. Whether you're out catching a
              late-nite feature or staying in on a hot August night, you'll want to know what recent
              movies have tackled big philosophical ideas. With the help of listeners and special
              guests, Johnand Ken turn a philosophical eye to the past year's cinematic offerings,
              and present theirannual Dionysus Awards for the most philosophically-rich films of the
              last year.</p>

                  <p>Pantheism is the doctrine that the world is either identical with God or an
              expression of His nature. Pantheistic ideas appear in many schools of Buddhism and
              Hinduism, and in the Tao-te-Ching. Pantheism also has had defenders in Western
              philosophy, including Heraclitus, Spinoza, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. Many of the
              Romantic poets, like Shelley, Keats, and Wordsworth, were considered pantheists. In
              modern times, the ecological movement has led to new interest in pantheism and its
              emphasis on nature as sacred. Is there a consistent world view that all these
              philosophies have in common? And how should we understand the claim that nature is to
              be worshipped? John and Ken welcome back Philip Clayton from the Claremont Graduate

                  <p>Though his name is often misleadingly associated with indulgence in sensual
              pleasures, the philosopher Epicurus developed a far-reaching system of thought that
              incorporated an empiricist theory of knowledge, a description of nature based on
              atomistic materialism, and views about the importance of friendship and both mental
              and physical pleasures for leading the good life. &#x9d; These notions of what constitutes
              a good life have preserved the relevance of Epicurean philosophy for contemporary
              life. A diverse array of thinkers, including Thomas Jefferson, Diderot, and Jeremy
              Bentham, have considered themselves Epicureans. So what is the legacy of Epicurus, and
              how have his ideas become integrated into the fabric of modernity? With great
              pleasure, John and Ken welcome David Konstan from NYU, author of <title render="italic">A Life Worthy of the Gods: The Materialist Psychology of

                  <p>There seems to be a paradox in leadership: the qualities of ruthlessness and
              opportunism necessary to attain power and become a leader are not necessarily the

              traits that make it likely that someone will become a leader correlate positively or
              negatively with the traits that make a good and effective leader? Do our democratic
              institutions lead to better leaders than, say, a lottery like the Athenians used? Ken

                  <p>It may seem doubtful that philosophers have much to tell us about love (beyond their
              love of wisdom). Surely it is the poets who have the market cornered when it comes to
              deep reflection on the nature of love. John and Ken question the notion that love
              cannot be captured by the light of reason by turning their attention to the philosophy
              of love with philosopher-poet Troy Jollimore from CSU Chico. Troy is the author of
                <title render="italic">Love s Vision</title>, as well as two collections of poems:
                <title render="italic">At Lake Scugog</title> and 2006's <title render="italic">Tom
                Thomson in Purgatory</title>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. This

                  <p>When someone acts without regard for our feelings or needs, a natural response is to
              feel resentment toward that person. But is that a rational response? What if there's
              no such thing as free will? Is blame still appropriate in a deterministic universe? Or

                  <p>When we make claims about things that could have been "what philosophers call
              counterfactual statements "we are, in some sense, sliding between different worlds. We
              all use counterfactual statements frequently. But what would make our speculations
              about what might have been in a different scenario true or false? When I say things
              could have gone differently than they did, I am speaking of a possible world in which
              things did, in fact, go differently. But how do we make sense of this talk of possible
              worlds? How can there be facts other than facts about the actual world? John and Ken

                  <p>The US prides itself on the strength of its democratic institutions and considers
              itself a leader in the promotion of democratic values around the globe. But can we
              consistently maintain this self-image in the face of the growing power of
              corporations? How are capitalism and globalization subverting the interests of
              democracy at home and abroad? Does the problem stem from fundamental inconsistencies
              between global capitalism and national democracy? Can regulations provide a solution,
              and if so, who has the authority to create and enforce these regulations? John and Ken

                  <p>Throughout human history, people have tended to live and die in the place they're
              born. Place is an important part of identity. But what happens when people are
              deprived of this sense of place? What psychological effects do emigrants, exiles, and
              expatriates endure? What happens to the importance of place when community membership
              can be based on common interests among people linked by email and facebook? John and

                  <p>Hypocrites believe one thing, but do another. Jefferson opposed slavery, but owned
              slaves. Jesus professed universal love, but cursed an innocent fig tree. Jerry Brown
              opposes the death penalty, but as governor of California will be responsible for
              executions. Hypocrites all--but vile hypocrites? Surely it was better that Jefferson
              was a hypocrite, and articulated the case against slavery, than not opposing it at
              all. Does it take courage to defend a view that you, yourself, don't have the courage
              or the character to follow through on? John and Ken try to practice what they preach

                  <p>We may think of ourselves as rational decision-makers, but we often base even
              high-stakes decisions on intuitions or "gut feelings" rather than explicit reasoning.
              Decisionsbased on intuition are not highly esteemed in business, politics, or medicine
              which maylead decision-makers to construct elaborate post facto rationalizations to
              explain theirintuitive choices. What place should intuitions have in important
              decision-making? Isthere a role for expertise in developing reliable gut-feelings?

                  <p>Morality tells us how we ought to behave, if we want to do the right thing. But is
              there a reason why we ought to be moral in the first place? Both Plato and Kant

                  <p>Some consider the commodification of sexual services inherently wrong, something that
              ought to be abolished outright. Others claim that prostitution is a legitimate form of
              commerce and that changing its legal status would reduce or eliminate most harms to
              sex workers. So in a just society, are there any conditions under which buying and
              selling sex are morally acceptable? Does the sex trade inevitably involve coercion of
              some kind, or can becoming a sex worker ever be a free, fully autonomous choice? John
              and Ken explore the complexities of the world's oldest profession with novelist,

                  <p>Some words, like n****r, ch*nk, and c*nt, are so forbidden that we won't even spell
              them out here. Decent people simply don't use these words to refer to others; they are
              intrinsically disrespectful. But aren't words just strings of sounds or letters? Words
              have life because they express ideas. But in a free society, how can we prohibit the
              expression of ideas? How can we forbid words? Where does the strange power of curses,
              epithets, and scatological terms come from? John and Ken avoid mincing words with

                  <p>With the recent global economic crisis, many people wonder if our economic policies
              are built on sound principles or on dubious, unscientific claims. What kinds of

              consumers? What kinds of assumptions does it make about the rationality of

                  <p>A good novel can do many things. It can distract us from the humdrum of daily
              existence, stimulate our imaginations, and delight us with its creative use of
              language. But isn’t there something more we gain from engaging with fictional worlds
              and characters? Do we, for example, use literary texts to morally improve ourselves?
              Is there some deeper truth we’re supposed to learn from a good novel? Or do we use

                  <p>Egalitarian principles play an important role in our moral and political discourse.
              Yet there’s no doubt that some people are smarter, stronger, or more talented in
              certain respects than others. So was Thomas Jefferson wrong to think that all men are
              created equal? Might we reasonably think that some people are better than others? If
              so, should the “elite” be treated differently? Should we, for example, find immoral
              acts committed by a great artist less reprehensible than the same acts committed by a
              common person? John and Ken level the playing field with Thomas Hurka from the

                  <p>According to Corinthians 13, “Love is patient, love is kind and envies no one.” But
              is love always unconditional? Should it be? If unconditional love means that we love
              no matter what our beloved’s actions or traits are, doesn’t that suggest we should
              love everyone in this way? If not, how do we select just a few to love
              unconditionally? Perhaps the feeling we reserve for those we cherish most in the world
              is better described as selfless rather than unconditional love, in which case we are
              confronted with another challenge. What happens when our beloved changes radically and
              loses the very features that caused us to love in the first place? John and Ken talk

                  <p>Modern science has made astounding progress in our understanding of ourselves and the
              universe. Physics, neuroscience, and psychology now tackle questions that a few
              decades ago could only be explored through philosophical speculation. So some vocal
              members of the scientific community, and even members of the general public, have
              suggested that philosophy itself has become a superfluous, archaic practice. Is
              philosophy useful and applicable today? Or has it been reduced to a dissociated game

                  <p>A new year offers an opportunity to reflect on the significant events of the previous
              year. But what ideas and events took shape over the past twelve months that have
              prompted us to question our assumptions and to think about things in new ways? Join
              John, Ken, and their special guests as they celebrate the examined year with a
              philosophical look back at 2012.</p>
                  <p> • The Year in Philosophy: Barbara Grosz from the Harvard School of Engineering and
              Applied Sciences discusses the legacy of Alan Turing, whose centennial was celebrated
              in 2012. • The Year in Politics: Jason Stanley from Rutgers University explores the
              precarious place of Truth in the presidential election and beyond. • The Year in
              Science: Hank Greely from the Stanford Law School talks about the ethical and legal
              implications of the year's advances in genetics.</p>

                  <p>Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can also hurt you. And language
              gives us surprisingly many ways to deride, hurt and demean – from a subtly sneering
              intonation to hurtful and offensive names. How does such language work? And why is
              there so much of it around these days? Has our acerbic political culture ushered in a
              new era of name-calling? Or is name calling a phenomenon as old as language itself?

                  <p>Recent advances in mapping the human genome suggest a vision of the future that might
              fill us with equal parts hope and dread. On the one hand, the possibility of
              identifying disease-causing genes may enable us to eradicate cancer, obesity, or
              depression before they ever develop. On the other hand, the idea that soon we could be
              “designing” our progeny, choosing physical and psychological traits we deem desirable,
              is fraught with deep moral complexities. But are these ideas realistic or just the
              stuff of science fiction? What real ethical problems does the current state of human
              genomics present? John and Ken map out the terrain with David Magnus, Director of the

                  <p>What is a self? Merely a human being? Or perhaps a soul? Hume claimed he could not
              find a self when he looked within, only a succession of impressions. But other
              philosophers seem to find transcendental selves, momentary selves, and objective
              selves, among others. Do the modern physical and biological sciences shed light on the
              self, or do they suggest there is no room – and no need – for such things? John and
              Ken examine their selves and others with Jenann Ismael from the University of Arizona,

                  <p>If the precise value of many physical constants had been different, the universe
              would not have supported life, human life, consciousness, philosophy and us. Is it
              just luck – without which we wouldn't even be here to worry about it? Or is there a
              Creator who wanted things to turn out the way they did, and fine-tuned the universe to
              get that result? What if there were many universes, with many combinations of values

                  <p>Most of us think we know the truth when we see it. But what exactly is truth, anyway?
              Philosophers have offered a blizzard of different answers, ranging from truth as
              correspondence or coherence all the way to the view that truth is a matter of
              pragmatic utility or just a compliment we pay to the things we're prepared to believe
              or to say. But what is the truth about truth? Is there really such a thing? Or is

                  <p>Whether it be rhythmic or shuffling, athletic or pedestrian, erotic or just social,
              dance is an art form that utilizes movement of the body through space. Could the

                  <p>We all want to lead a moral life. But even if we all agreed on what that would mean,
              we still have to to balance our own self-interest with the competing demands of
              morality. This becomes even more challenging when the decks are stacked against us, or
              when everyone around us is only looking out for themselves. So in the real world, what
              does it mean to live a moral life? Do we have a responsibility to act morally when
              others around us are not? And what do we do if morality makes excessive demands of us?

                  <p>A theodicy is an explanation by a philosopher or theologian about why a world created
              by a kind and all-powerful God contains so much suffering. It forces us to think about
              the nature of good and evil, about whether the kind of knowledge an all-knowing God
              has leaves room for human freedom. Why do people who suffer often find their faith in
              God growing stronger? Is evil an illusion? Does God really need a defense attorney?

                  <p>It sounds plausible to require that all our beliefs be based on evidence and sound
              reasoning. Yet some people's most cherished beliefs, like their belief in a deity, are
              based on faith alone. Does that make those beliefs fundamentally irrational, or could
              there be some rational justification for such faith? And what about reason itself—are
              there limits to what can be known rationally? Does our reliance on reason demand a
              kind of faith of its own? Is there a way to reconcile faith and reason, or does the
              well-lived life demand that we choose one over the other? John Ken put reasonable
              faith in Howard Wettstein from UC Riverside, author of The Significance of Religious
              Experience. This program was recorded live on campus as part of the Stanford
              Continuing Studies course The Art of Living.</p>

                  <p>Summer is the perfect time to dig in to deep reading. Heidegger's <title render="italic">Being and Time</title> may be a bit much to take to the beach, but
              there are lots of readable classics that could make your summer reading a
              transformative experience. John and Ken ask a few of their favorite past guests about
              the book that has most transformed their life and thinking, and they take more
              recommendations for philosophically-rich summer reading from listeners around the
              country.</p>

                  <p>The world disclosed by the physical sciences can seem depressing. Modern physics, for
              example, has undermined the religious idea that the universe has a spiritual
              dimension. Quantum physics in particular seems to present the world as more
              paradoxical than rational. Is there room within – or in addition to – the world
              presented to us by the physical sciences for ideas such as freedom, dignity, justice,
              and even God? Or should these all be regarded as useful illusions? John and Ken search

                  <p>In contemporary democracies, the state is responsible for providing children with an
              education. But parents surely have both the right and responsibility for instilling
              appropriate morals and values in their children. How should we reconcile conflicts
              between the state’s responsibility to properly educate minors and the parents’ rights
              to influence their children's values and ideals? Should the government’s approach to
              education in areas such as history and science always trump that of the child’s most
              direct guardians? Or should parents hold some veto power when it comes to education
              about evolution, sex, and other issues that bear on religious and personal values?

                  <p>One’s country of birth has a profound effect on life prospects. It's often best to go
              elsewhere. But moving is not always so easy. Borders and immigration control restrict
              people from going where they want to pursue a better life. On the one hand there is
              the state’s need for security, self-determination, and a functioning economy. But why
              should arbitrary boundaries, based on past thefts of territory, limit a person's
              opportunities? Are borders essential to nationhood, or do they form an exclusive club
              that unfairly keeps certain people from pursuing a better life? John and Ken lift the

                  <p>All there is in the world is physical stuff. That is the fundamental assumption of
              the materialist standpoint, and the picture given to us by science. But if there is no
              immaterial soul that survives the death of the body, no other realm to bestow meaning
              on our lives, how can we avoid despairing in light of this apparent pointlessness? Is
              there any way we can build meaning from the naturalistic building blocks that science
              provides? John and Ken talk materially with Owen Flanagan from Duke University, author

                  <p>We know what it means for a painting to be beautiful. But what about a life? Like
              great works of art, great people exhibit style, originality, and creativity. Maybe,
              then, to live well is just to practice an ART of living. But what do the values that
              are important to a good life – happiness, moral goodness, or friendship, for example –
              have to do with aesthetic beauty? Aren’t the qualities that make a work of art good
              different from the qualities that make a life good? Is there really such thing as a
              "beautiful" life? John and Ken paint their masterpiece with Lanier Anderson from

                  <p>Gangnam style, Lolcats, and Chuck Norris’ superhuman feats are all memes – units of
              cultural transmission – that spread through the internet. But when the term was
              originally coined, memes were posited as vehicles of a kind of evolution, similar to
              genes and biological evolution. So are the memes that colonize our brains simply those
              that survive natural selection? Don’t we get any say in the viruses that populate our
              minds? What happens if the fittest memes are also the most detrimental to us? John and

                  <p>From Aristotle and Kant to Hume and Darwin, philosophers and scientists have long
              denied the idea that animals are capable of acting for moral reasons. Yet empirical
              evidence suggests that many animals have rich emotional lives, and some even
              demonstrate distinctly altruistic or empathetic behavior. So how should we interpret
              this behavior? Do the moral feelings of animals suggest they are capable of responding
              to moral reasons? Or do they lack the cognitive capacity necessary for being truly
              moral? John and Ken examine their animal nature with Mark Rowlands from the University

                  <p>Today, the term ‘cynic’ brings to mind a person who has little or no faith in the
              goodness of the human race. In ancient Athens, however, it meant something quite
              different: one who rejects all social conventions in order to live in accordance with
              nature. The Cynics believed that such a life was necessary for freedom and virtue. Why
              did they think so? What are the most important tenets of Cynic philosophy? And are
              there any reasons to live now as the Cynics once did? John and Ken sincerely welcome

                  <p>Descartes considered the mind to be fully self-transparent; that is, he thought that
              we need only introspect to know what goes on inside our own minds. More recently,
              social psychology has shown that a great deal of high-level cognition takes place at
              an unconscious level, inaccessible to introspection. How then do we gain insight into
              ourselves? How reliable are the narratives that we construct about ourselves and our
              internal lives? Are there other reliable routes to self-knowledge, or are we condemned
              to being forever deluded about who we truly are? John and Ken look inward with Timothy

                  <p>We are often taught that vengeance is a reprehensible or unworthy motivation and
              that, as a result, pursuing revenge should not be the method of choice when meting out
              punishment for crimes. Incarceration and other penalties, according to this view, can
              only be justified in as much as they protect society, rehabilitate criminals, or deter
              further crime. But are these approaches to punishment really more just than the
              retributive or vengeance model? Don’t the victims of crime deserve some kind of
              payback for their suffering? Are justice and revenge in conflict with one another, or

                  <p>A trolley is approaching a track junction, and you happen to be standing by the
              switch. If you do nothing, the trolley will kill a number of innocent children playing
              on the tracks. If you throw the switch, it will kill only one fat man, who is sleeping
              on the tracks. The so-called Trolley Problem sheds light on many claims in moral
              philosophy: utilitarian positions (doing what's best for the greatest number), the
              difference between doing and letting happen (being more obliged to not cause harm than
              to prevent harm), and issues of "collateral damage" (killing one person to save
              others). John and Ken ride the trolley with Thomas Cathcart, author of The Trolley
              Problem, or Would You Throw the Fat Guy Off the Bridge: A Philosophical Conundrum.</p>

                  <p>Science aims tell us something about nearly everything, from the atoms in our cells
              to the motions of the stars. It assumes that knowledge is good for its own sake, and
              therefore takes as its sole purpose the acquisition of knowledge. But shouldn’t
              knowledge serve practical and ethical concerns, like ending conflict and feeding the
              hungry? Could some knowledge be interesting, but ultimately irrelevant? And isn’t
              there some knowledge we might be better off without, such as how to build nuclear
              weapons? John and Ken test their claims with UC Berkeley anthropologist Paul Rabinow.

                  <p>All over the world, people are living longer and having fewer children than ever
              before. In less than two decades, one fifth of the US population will be over 65 years
              old. So what do these radically changed demographics mean for how we re-imagine the
              shape of a human life? Should we think of the rapidly increasing older population as a
              blessing or a burden? And what kinds of changes should we make – both individually and
              as a society – to adjust to this new world awash with old folks? John and Ken remain
              young at heart with Laura Carstensen, Director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, in

                  <p>In most Western democracies, religions are exempt from certain rules and regulations
              that most other organizations have to follow. For example, in the US, religious
              organizations are not required to pay taxes or follow non-discrimination employment
              laws. Some faithful go so far as to argue that their religious freedom means they
              shouldn’t have to provide birth control to their employees. But does religion truly
              deserve this preferential treatment? Should the demands for legal exemption based on
              religious freedom be treated any differently than those based on moral conscience?
              What special status, if any, should religion have in the eyes of the law? John and Ken

                  <p>If we couldn't trust each other, our lives would be very different. We trust

                  <p>It seems reasonable to believe that we can only be blamed or praised for actions that
              are under our control. Nevertheless, in many concrete scenarios, we're inclined to
              base our moral assessment of people on circumstances that are ultimately beyond their
              control. Blind chance, or “moral luck,” as philosophers call it, may determine the
              difference between, say, murder and attempted murder. But do we think that a would-be
              murderer whose attempts are foiled by chance is really less morally culpable than
              someone who happens to succeed? How should moral luck affect our judgments of
              responsibility? John and Ken welcome back Susan Wolf from UNC Chapel Hill, author of

                  <p>Ever since John Locke, philosophers have wondered about memory and its connection to
              the self. Locke believed that a continuity of consciousness and memory establish a
              "self" over time. Now psychology is weighing in with new research suggesting that the
              relationship between memory and the self is even more complicated than that. But
              what's the connection between memory and the self? Can the self be explained strictly
              in terms of memory? Or might the self be something over and above what memory
              suggests? John and Ken remember to welcome Stan Klein from UC Santa Barbara, author of

                  <p>Did you really want to eat that last piece of cake, or were you secretly thinking
              about your mother? Sigmund Freud, who might have suggested the latter, established the
              unconscious mind as a legitimate domain for scientific research. He was the first to
              seriously study dreams and slips of the tongue, and he proposed that neurotic behavior
              could be explained by beliefs and desires that we repress. However, many of Freud’s
              theories have been rejected as unscientific, and his particular brand of
              psychoanalysis is all but obsolete. So why is Freud still worth remembering? John and

                  <p>What does gender have to do with science? The obvious answer is ‘nothing.’ Science is
              the epitome of an objective, rational, and disinterested enterprise. But given the
              history of systemic under-representation of women in science, what does it mean that
              science answers almost exclusively to the methodologies of men? Has male domination
              contributed certain unfounded assumptions or cognitive biases to the ‘objectivity’ of
              scientific inquiry? Is there any possibility of achieving a gender-neutral science,

                  <p>Simone de Beauvoir is often cast as only a novelist or a mere echo of Jean-Paul
              Sartre. But she authored many philosophical texts beyond The Second Sex, and the
              letters between her and Sartre reveal that both were equally concerned with
              existentialist questions of radical ontological freedom, the issue of self-deception,
              and the dynamics of desire. This episode explores the evolution of de Beauvoir's
              existential-ethical thinking. In what sense did she find that we are all radically
              free? Are we always to blame for our self-deception or can social institutions be at
              fault? John and Ken sit down at the café with Shannon Mussett from Utah Valley
              University, co-editor of <title render="italic">Beauvoir and Western Thought from

                  <p>Many goals are too complex for one person to accomplish alone. Every day, we pool
              together our planning abilities with those around us to get things done. It’s clear
              that without shared agency, none of our familiar social institutions could exist.
              However, philosophers are in disagreement about what shared agency actually entails.
              What is it about collective action that's unique, and why does it come about? How is
              acting together sometimes greater than the sum of its parts? John and Ken join forces

                  <p>The United States recently threatened military action against Syria in response to
              the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Similar threats have been
              made against states suspected of trying to develop nuclear arsenals such as North
              Korea and Iran. Yet the U.S., the U.K., France, Russia, and China have thousands of
              active nuclear weapons of their own. Is there a morally significant difference between
              nuclear or chemical weapons and conventional weapons? Should we work toward total
              disarmament, or do we need these weapons as a deterrent to rogue states? What steps
              must we take to secure peace in a world rife with weapons of mass destruction? John

                  <p>Some claim that the collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11 was actually caused
              by a controlled demolition orchestrated by the U.S. government. Dramatic conspiracy
              theories of this kind are all over the place, but they are often dismissed as crazy.
              Sometimes, however, they turn out to be true: the NSA, as we have learned, conducted
              secret surveillance of millions of people for more than ten years. Does this show that
              we shouldn’t be so dismissive of conspiracy theories after all, or that we simply
              refuse to accept the existence of coincidence? What is a conspiracy theory, anyway,
              and how is it different from other kinds of theories? John and Ken form a cabal with

                  <p>There is an element of risk – either to ourselves or to others – in almost everything
              we do. By deciding to go to the grocery store, for example, we take a (very small)
              risk of getting into a car accident. Many risks are acceptable, of course, but how do
              we know when a risk is worth taking? The most important decisions, after all, are
              often risky ones. What about risks to others' welfare? How do we, and should we, take

                  <p>Is the red you see indeed the very same red that anyone else does? What is the
              redness of red even like? These sorts of questions are not just amusing, if worn-out,
              popular philosophical ponderings. Thinkers in the philosophy of perception take such
              questions as serious windows into the nature of the world and of the mind. Although we
              are constantly surrounded by colors, the experience of perceiving them – what it is
              like to see red, for example - remains a mysterious phenomenon. Where are colors: in
              objects, or in our minds? Could color experiences ever be explainable in terms of raw
              physical facts? Or is there something about color that goes beyond what science can

                  <p>St. Augustine suggested that when we try to grasp the idea of time, it seems to evade
              us: "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it
              to him who asks, I do not know." So is time real or merely an artificial construct? Is
              time a fundamental or emergent property of our universe or a part of our cognitive
              apparatus? Do we live in a continuum with a definite past and present, or do we live
              in a succession of ‘Nows’, and if the latter is the case, how does it affect our
              perception of memory or recollection? John and Ken take their time with Julian Barbour

              so well engineered that its outputs pass for genuinely human behaviors. Technology is
              not yet so advanced, but these robots might cause us to wonder how we could possibly
              justify our belief in the minds of others. You’re most likely sure that your family,
              friends, and boss are really people just like you, with similarly rich inner mental
              lives. But how can you be so sure? If we only have access to our own private thoughts,

                  <p>What philosophers, philosophies, or philosophical issues would you like to read up on
              over the summer? John and Ken discuss one of this year's most talked-about books,
              Capital in the 21st Century by Thomas Piketty, with political scientist Shannon
              Stimson. They also get summer reading suggestions from author Rebecca Newberger
              Goldstein, whose new book is Plato at the Googleplex: Why Philosophy Won't Go Away,
              and Yale University philosopher Jason Stanley, author of the forthcoming Why
              Propaganda Matters. Plus more suggestions from members of our Community of

                  <p>What do Marcel Duchamp, Damien Hirst, and Andres Serrano have in common? They’ve all
              created modern works of art that have shocked and outraged the general public, causing
              many to question whether these works have any artistic value at all. But isn’t it the
              purpose of art to incite inquiry and question conventional moral wisdom? If so, then a
              strong public reaction would seem to prove the artistic merit of these works. So, is
              there a clear line to be drawn between genuine art and mere obscenity? Or has shock
              value simply replaced cultural value in the world of contemporary art? John and Ken

                  <p>Since George W. Bush first declared a "war on terror," the US has been engaged in a
              global campaign to rid the world of terrorists. But what exactly is a “terrorist,” and
              how do we distinguish illicit terrorist organizations from legitimate freedom
              fighters? Do terrorists exhibit particular psychological patterns of behavior, or are
              there some tactics that only terrorists use? And what is the most effective way to
              combat terrorism – by waging war, engaging in "de-radicalization" processes, or some

                  <p>Imagine discovering that your grandfather was a serial killer. Would you feel guilty
              about it? Would you be at all tempted to contact the families of his victims?
              Philosophers have long thought that we can only be responsible for what is under our
              voluntary control, but sometimes we feel guilty about events we didn’t bring about,
              simply because we are connected in some way to those who did. Many Germans, for
              instance, feel guilty about their ancestors' participation in the Nazi regime. Can we
              really be responsible for things outside of our control? Or are these feelings just
              vestiges of a more primitive moral outlook? John and Ken play innocent with Larry May

                  <p>Recent revelations confirm what many already suspected: not only is Big Brother
              watching you, he is also potentially reading your emails, listening to your phone
              calls, mapping your personal networks, and tracking your every move. While many see
              whistleblowers as heroes, others see them as criminals who ought to be severely
              punished. So, how should we treat whistleblowers who break the law for moral or
              political ends? How do we adjudicate between national or corporate security and
              individual rights? And what kind of rights and responsibilities does a proactive

                  <p>Whether it's people incarcerated in prisons, or animals confined in zoos, aquariums,
              laboratories, farms, and in our own homes, millions of upon millions of sentient
              creatures live in captivity. To be held captive, some might say, is to be denied basic
              rights of autonomy. But physical captivity, others might say, can have significant
              social benefits. So under what conditions could it be morally justified to hold a
              creature in captivity? Should we think of humans and animals differently? And in a
              civil society, is captivity a necessary harm, or should we work towards eradicating
              it? John and Ken have a captivating conversation with Lori Gruen from Wesleyan

                  <p>For decades, literary critics have been questioning the relevance of the novel as a
              literary form, with some going so far as to declare its death. But if the novel is
              dead, it’s not clear what new form can take its place. Should we treat the popularity
              of the memoir as a sign that what readers want is more truth, less fiction? Or is the
              memoir, like ‘reality TV,’ mostly just fiction dressed up as fact? In these fragmented
              times, when everything has already been said or done before, can there be any truly
              original innovations in art and literature? Or is the demand for originality itself an

              a bowling ball will fall from a tall building at exactly the same speed. This is not
              to say that Aristotle wasn’t a brilliant thinker; empirical evidence shows he just had
              a wrong intuition. Even the most powerful intuitions we have can be misleading. Why is
              it, then, that many philosophers treat them as crucial when arguing for a conclusion?

                  <p>Doing the right thing is often an extremely difficult task. Yet psychological
              research indicates that infants as young as 21 months old have a crude sense of what
              is right and wrong. This capacity is reflected by infants' decisions to reward or
              punish characters in social scenarios. But surely a genuine, robust, mature moral
              compass is much more complicated than that. So what can babies tell us about adult
              morality? How much of morality is innate, and how much must we develop as moral
              thinkers? John and Ken talk infant morality with Paul Bloom from Yale University,

                  <p>Niccolò Machiavelli is best known for arguing that people in power should use
              deception, force, and manipulation if those tactics are necessary to achieve their
              ends. In an age of unscrupulous politics and ruthless business practice, shouldn't we
              be encouraging a move away from Machiavellian thinking? Then again, are we even sure
              that those "Machiavellian" views were really Machiavelli's? If not, what did he really
              think, and what might we learn from him? John and Ken plot and scheme with Maurizio

                  <p>We like to think of ourselves as self-aware, reflective beings, but psychological
              studies demonstrate that we’re usually overconfident in the accuracy of our own
              beliefs. Memory, for example, can be extremely unreliable, even when we feel certain
              we know what happened. Surprisingly, when we’re made aware of this, we adjust our
              level of confidence in ourselves only slightly. How, then, can we doubt ourselves in a
              rational and efficient manner to bring our beliefs closer to reality? And, just as
              importantly, how do we prevent ourselves from falling into the other extreme of
              constant second guessing? John and Ken don't think twice with Sherri Roush from UC

                  <p>Whether for counterterrorism measures, street level crime, or immigration, racial
              profiling of minorities occurs frequently. However, racial profiling is illegal under

              is it always an unjustified form of racism? Is there any evidence that certain races
              or ethnic groups have a tendency to behave in particular ways? Or is racial

                  <p>From Plato and Sextus Empiricus to Wittgenstein, many important thinkers have thought
              of philosophy as a type of therapy. By looking at our way of life through a
              philosophical lens, we can achieve a particular kind of understanding that can bring
              us peace of mind. But can philosophy really help those who experience mental anguish?
              Don’t we have shrinks and medication for that? If philosophy is more likely to raise
              more questions than it offers answers, how could it help us overcome suffering? What
              would it mean for an emotional or psychological problem to have a philosophical cure?

              day in gym class. Right as your heart begins to swell with pride, he reveals that he

                  <p>Would you want to live forever? It's a tempting notion that has been explored and
              imagined for centuries. Immortality may be desirable, but it may also be that death is
              a significant part of what gives meaning to life. So what would a society of immortal
              individuals look like? What might some of the challenges or rewards of an immortal
              life be? How would living forever affect our relationships with one another, our life
              goals, or simply the way we perceive time? Would the impacts of immortality ultimately

                  <p>People tend to treat other people who differ from them, even in seemingly small and

              has sometimes led to great atrocities like the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda, and
              the slave trade. It is arguably responsible for such widespread social ills as racism,
              sexism, and xenophobia. Where does our tendency to dehumanize others come from? Is it
              based on bad arguments hat can be rationally refuted, or are its origins deeper in the
              human psyche? Are we bound to see the "other" as less than fully human? John and Ken

                  <p>"The unexamined year is not worth reviewing. But what ideas and events that took
              shape over the past year have prompted us to question our assumptions and to think
              about things in new ways? What significant events – in politics, in science, and in
              philosophy itself – have called into question our most deeply-held beliefs? John and
              Ken celebrate the examined year with a philosophical look back at the year that was

                  <p>The question of what happens to us after we die remains as mysterious now as it
              always was. Some think that death amounts to total annihilation of the self; others
              adhere to certain religious traditions, which teach that the immaterial soul (and, in
              some traditions, the resurrected body) can ultimately survive death. So how are we to
              judge between these radically different views of what happens to us in death? What
              would it mean for the self to persist beyond the destruction of the body? Is there
              room in a scientific account of the mind for the existence of an immaterial soul? John
              and Ken see the light with Richard Swinburne from the University of Oxford, author of

                  <p>Anarchism says there's no need for a state, that it would be better to have a society
              without central government. Anarchists dislike the often heavy-handed authority that
              government brings. Yet the dream of the stateless society is not a simple one. How can
              we have law and order without government? What's involved in a self-governed society,
              free from authority? And how could we ever peacefully transition from central
              governance to anarchy? John and Ken question authority with James Martel from San

                  <p>The number of chronically hungry people in the world is over 800 million, yet
              developed countries are facing health challenges from rising rates of obesity. The
              growing problems of food security and water scarcity seem an issue of distribution
              rather than availability. But other factors also influence the status of food and
              water security worldwide. So where does the problem with food and water security lie?
              Do developed countries – or any other entities or individuals – have any moral
              obligations to ensure a global network of water and food security? What practical,

                  <p>Albert Camus is most famous for his existential works of fiction including The
              Stranger as well as his philosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus. He led the French
              resistance press during Nazi Occupation and became one of the youngest Nobel laureates
              in literature. His contemporary, Hannah Arendt, described him as “head and shoulders
              above the other intellectuals.” How does Camus' philosophy of Absurdism compare and
              contrast with Sartre’s popular existentialism, especially in their conceptions of
              freedom? What political and philosophical issues of his time were he deeply involved
              in, and what relevance does his thinking still hold for the problems of contemporary
              life? John and Ken remain sensible with Robert Zaretsky from the University of
              Houston, author of <title render="italic">A Life Worth Living: Albert Camus and the

                  <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual is the primary reference catalog for mental
              health illnesses. But whereas a medical textbook will show you the picture of a broken

              symptoms. Who creates these lists, and based on what criteria? Do such lists really
              capture the nature of a mental illness? What does it mean to be a disease of the mind

                  <p>Democratic systems of government are supposed to reflect the interests of ordinary
              citizens, and not some shadowy political elite. But more and more, we see the
              influence of big money and special interest groups in so-called democratic politics,
              while income inequality and voter suppression grow. With millions convinced that
              politicians don’t speak for them, is there a "crisis of representation" in the US? Are
              these problems a result of political decay in our institutions, or is democracy in
              trouble everywhere? How can we achieve an efficient and prosperous democracy in which
              the average citizen is truly represented? Should we consider a radically different
              system of government? John and Ken keep calm with renowned political scientist Francis

                  <p>Belief in God is thought by many to be the only possible source of morality, such
              that without a God, “everything is permitted.” Yet godlessness is on the rise in the
              West, with figures like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Lawrence Krauss leading the
              “New Atheism” movement. But if atheism is defined by its lack of belief, where do
              these non-believers find their guiding moral principles? Are there any positive
              beliefs or values that atheists have in common? If so, are they based on a rational,
              scientific framework, or must non-believers, like believers, ultimately rely on faith?

                  <p>We all hope for peace. Yet in the face of violence, it often seems the only recourse
              is more violence. Advocates of non-violence claim it’s not necessary to respond to war
              in kind, and that responding violently, even in self-defense, just perpetuates the
              cycle of violence. So how can we practice non-violence under the direct threat of
              violence? Can non-violent acts be spread to stop aggression and war? And are there
              times when violence is, in fact, necessary? John and Ken keep the peace with renowned
              cultural critic Judith Butler, for a program recorded live at the Marsh Theatre in

                  <p>Torture is prohibited under international law and is widely considered a human rights
              violation. But despite the fact that 157 countries ratified the UN Convention Against
              Torture, it is still practiced in many states to this day. Moreover, while we might
              associate torture with dictatorships, liberal democracies pioneered the modern
              techniques that leave no physical trace. So why do democracies torture? Can calling
              torture by other names, such as “enhanced interrogation,” really resolve the deep
              conflict between what we say and what we do? Or has the taboo against torture finally
              been broken? John and Ken enhance their interrogation of Darius Rejali from Reed

                  <p>According to Buddhist tradition, all people must suffer illness, aging, and death.
              Yet the universe is seen as a vast living entity, in which cycles of individual life
              and death are repeated without cease. Therefore death is a necessary part of the
              process of life, making renewal and new growth possible. So what does this view mean
              about the eternality of the self? Is there a single subject or consciousness that
              persists through all the cycles of death and rebirth? What are the karmic consequences
              of one’s moral acts for future lives? And how can the view of endless death and
              rebirth lead to greater compassion for all life? John and Ken revisit their past with

                  <p>Humans have an amazing capacity to communicate. By uttering sounds we are able to
              convey meaning to those around us. These noises we make take on properties – they mean
              certain things, they are true or false, etc. Some animals also use forms of language:
              bees, for example, use dances and pheromones to communicate with each other. What
              gives these signals – words and movements – their linguistic meaning? How is it
              possible to communicate complex propositions simply by making sound? John and Ken cut
              through the noise with celebrated philosopher of language John Searle, in a program

                  <p>Governments and other political institutions employ propaganda to sway public
              opinion, instill ideas, and exert a degree of control over people. While totalitarian
              regimes have been known to do this explicitly, democratic governments often disguise
              their propaganda with persuasive rhetoric. So what exactly constitutes propaganda and
              how does it work? Does it always involve lies or falsehoods? Can propaganda ever be

                  <p>The ideal of science is objectivity in the service of advancing knowledge. We tend to
              assume that to be objective, scientists must keep their politics from influencing
              their work. But time and time again we see that science, even some of our best
              science, is awash in political influences. Could politics sometimes have a positive
              effect on objectivity in science? If so, which kinds of politics might have a positive
              effect and which might not? What criteria could we use to make the distinction? And

                  <p>Best known for his work Being and Time, Martin Heidegger has been hailed by many as
              the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century. He has also been criticized for
              being both nearly unreadable and a Nazi. Yet there is no disputing his seminal place
              in the history of Western thought. So what did Heidegger mean when he wrote about
              world, being, and time? What significance does he still hold as a thinker today,
              especially as a philosopher of modern technology? Should we even read the works of a
              Nazi? John and Ken are present and ready with Thomas Sheehan from Stanford University,

                  <p>You might think we each have a moral duty to expose any serious misconduct,
              dishonesty, or illegal activity we discover in an organization, especially when such
              conduct directly threatens the public interest. However, increasingly we are seeing
              whistleblowers punished more harshly than the alleged wrongdoers, who often seem to
              get off scot-free. Given the possibility of harsh retaliation, how should we
              understand our moral duty to tell the truth and reveal wrongdoing? Should we think of
              whistleblowers as selfless martyrs, as traitors, or as something else? Do we need to
              change the laws to provide greater protection for whistleblowers? John and Ken welcome
              our era's most renowned whistleblower, former CIA analyst Edward Snowden, for a
              program recorded as part of the Stanford Symbolic Systems Program Distinguished

                  <p>We like to think of ourselves as rational agents who exercise conscious control over
              most of our actions and decisions. Yet in recent years, neuroscientists have claimed
              to prove that free will is simply an illusion, that our brains decide for us before
              our conscious minds even become aware. But what kind of evidence do these scientists
              rely on to support their sweeping conclusions? Is the "free will" they talk about the
              same kind of free will that philosophers have puzzled about for millennia? And could
              science ever prove that we lack the kind of freedom needed for moral responsibility?

                  <p>Satire is everywhere – in conversations with friends, in books, on television, and
              online. When used effectively, it can be a very powerful form of social commentary.
              But what happens when someone goes too far, or even worse, when some publication
              repeatedly goes too far? Aside from taking offense, can we reasonably demand that they
              pull their article from publication or issue an apology? Are there topics we should
              never satirize? Is there a well-defined line between satire and hate speech? John and
              Ken resist parody with Jane Kirtley, Director of the Silha Center for the Study of
              Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota.</p>

                  <p>The intellectual domain of Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz cannot be captured in a
              single word. For most of his life, he was a jurist, a courtier, a diplomat, and a
              librarian; he also made huge contributions to the study of logic, geometry, physics,
              botany, physiology, linguistics, and of course, the infinitesimal calculus. And yet,
              many of his ideas remain obscure to the modern reader. What in the world is a Monad?
              Why does Leibniz care so much about the so-called Principle of Sufficient Reason? And
              how could he claim that this is the Best of all Possible Worlds? John and Ken discuss

                  <p>Some futurists believe we are not far from a time when technology and medicine will
              be so advanced that humans need no longer die of old age or other natural causes.
              Eventually, not only will we be able to replace our natural body parts, but we might
              even be able to “download” our selves into a new cybernetic body. But is this a
              realistic possibility or just a confused fantasy? Is the self the kind of thing that
              can be downloaded and persist through radical changes in its “hardware”? And if it
              were possible for people to indefinitely extend their biological lives, what would the
              moral implications be for social inequality and distribution of the planet’s finite
              resources? John and Ken look beyond the mortal coil with Kevin O'Neill from the

                  <p>Plato’s Symposium is arguably the most memorable philosophical work ever written on
              the subject of love. It is also the inspiration for Leonard Bernstein’s gorgeous
              violin concerto, the Serenade. What would Plato think of Bernstein’s Serenade,
              especially given his criticism of art and poetry? Is Bernstein more interested in what
              one of Plato’s drunken characters calls “vulgar love”? Or is he inspired by Platonic
              love – the highest form of love? How does Bernstein explore these themes through his
              music? In this special episode featuring violin virtuoso Anne Akiko Meyers and the
              Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, John and Ken talk to Brandi Parisi from All Classical
              Portland radio about love – its nature, its origin and its purpose – and music</p>

                  <p>Imagine that the world will end in thirty days. Would your life have meaning anymore?
              Would anyone’s? It seems that there would no longer be any point to making
              technological or medical advances, developing new forms of art, or even taking good
              care of ourselves. Imagining the doomsday scenario shows that there is something
              particularly disturbing about the prospect that not only we, but also everyone else,
              will die. Why is this? Would our lives be nearly as meaningful if others did not live
              on after our death? Could our “collective afterlife” through the lives of others
              actually be more important than the “personal afterlife” with which we are so often
              preoccupied? John and Ken live on through Samuel Scheffler from NYU, author of

                  <p>Baruch Spinoza was a 17th century Dutch philosopher who laid the foundations for the
              Enlightenment. He made the controversial claim that there is only one substance in the
              universe, which led him to the pantheistic belief in an abstract, impersonal God. What
              effect did Spinoza have on Enlightenment thinkers? What are the philosophical – and
              religious – consequences of believing that there is only one substance in the
              universe? And why do scientists today still take him seriously? John and Ken welcome

                  <p>Innovation, be it social, economic, or technological, is often hailed as the panacea
              for all our troubles. Our obsession with innovation leads us to constantly want new
              things and to want them now. But past innovations are arguably the main reason for
              many of our current predicaments, which in turn creates a further need to innovate to
              solve those problems. So is innovation – and our obsession with it – ultimately a
              force for good or ill? Is our constant need to innovate a function of our biology, or
              just a product of various cultural forces? Can we ever escape the innovation loop?
              Should we try before it kills us? John and Ken find new ways to talk to Christian

                  <p>The criminal justice system often relies on the testimony of eyewitnesses to get
              convictions. Yet more and more, psychological science demonstrates how unreliable
              eyewitness reports can be. Moreover, jurors have all kinds of cognitive biases and
              unconscious influences, and they rely on dubious folk psychological theories when
              assessing evidence. So, how should psychological science be used to improve our
              justice system? Is there a way to figure out whether a particular eye witness report
              is reliable? Or for a truly just system, must we forbid all testimony that depends on
              the capricious faculty of memory? John and Ken take the stand with Daniel Reisberg

                  <p>We craft personal brands or images to accompany or represent ourselves in various
              situations. These personas are malleable – how we portray ourselves online differs
              from how we act at an event, which differs from the workplace or in the privacy of the
              home. Social media and the possibility of creating an online 'self' exacerbate this
              situation. We may wonder: who is the true self if we have the power change selves
              given various circumstances? Is there such a thing as 'one true self', or is the self
              merely a conglomerate of 'mini-selves' shaped by cultural and societal forces? Could
              it be detrimental to think of a self as socially constructed? John and Ken put their

                  <p>According to the Treatment Advocacy Center, there are more people living with mental
              illness in prisons than in psychiatric hospitals across the country. Despite the fact
              that prisoners can have significant medical needs, healthcare services are often
              woefully inadequate, which can turn a minor sentence into a death sentence. And for
              those dying in prison, few receive any hospice or palliative care. So what kinds of
              patients’ rights should prisoners have? Could improved healthcare in prisons actually
              reduce recidivism rates? How can we ensure dignity for prisoners in the age of
              for-profit prisons? John and Ken maintain their dignity with filmmaker Edgar Barens,

                  <p>Jean-Paul Sartre was one of the first global public intellectuals, famous for his
              popular existentialist philosophy, his works of fiction, and his rivalry with Albert
              Camus. His existentialism was also adopted by Simone de Beauvoir, who used it as a
              foundation for modern theoretical feminism. So what exactly is existentialism? How is
              man condemned to be free, as Sartre claimed? And what’s so hellish about other people?
              John and Ken speak in good faith with Thomas Flynn from Emory University, author of

                  <p>“White privilege” has become a buzzword in discussions about racial inequality and
              racial justice. The call to “check your privilege” appeals to those privileged to
              acknowledge the various ways they receive special treatment that others don’t. But
              when white people explicitly acknowledge their privilege, does this do anything to
              further racial equality? Is talking about “white privilege” just a way to assuage
              white liberal guilt? Instead of unequal privilege, should we be more focused on equal
              rights? What kind of theory of justice is required to improve black lives? John and
              Ken check their privilege with Naomi Zack from the University of Oregon, author of

                  <p>According to a report from the Jubilee Debt Campaign, there are currently 24
              countries facing a full-blown debt crisis, with 14 more on the verge. Globally, there
              is about $200 trillion of debt on the books. Although the poor and disenfranchised of
              the world play no role in negotiating these loans, in debt crises they usually end up
              paying the price. So when a country borrows money, who or what is the “economic agent”
              responsible for taking on the debt? Can traditional economic theory explain why we
              face debt crises and how we can get out of them? Or do we need a new economic model
              that dispels some of the myths of the traditional model and offers a more ethical
              solution to the global debt crisis? John and Ken are held to account with Julie Nelson
              from the University of Massachusetts Boston, author of Economics For Humans.</p>

                  <p>Positive psychology is an emerging science that investigates the qualities,
              attitudes, and practices that enable people to thrive and be happy. So what does this
              research reveal about human happiness? Are some of us just born with happier
              dispositions than others? How (if at all) do health, wealth, family relations, and
              community ties affect our happiness? Do happy people have a better or worse grip on
              reality than unhappy people? And is happiness something really worth pursuing? John

                  <p>The right to bear arms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment, is at once both
              distinctly American and highly controversial. Incidents such as the Sandy Hook school
              shooting force the nation to think hard about how the law should balance gun ownership
              with the risk these deadly weapons present to society. What kind of right is the right
              to bear arms, if it is a right at all? What responsibilities ought to come with gun
              ownership? And what can philosophical thinking contribute to such delicate policy

                  <p>We can all agree that helping others is great, a deed worth doing. But devoting too
              much to helping others – too much time, too many resources – may get you labelled an
              oddity, a freak. How much can morality demand of us? Is it good to live as moral a
              life as possible, or do we lose something – devotion to one’s family, for example – by
              adhering to extreme moral principles? Can somebody be both fully rational and also a
              saintly type? John and Ken lend a hand to New Yorker writer Larissa MacFarquhar,

                  <p>The old metaphysical question – why anything exists at all – has perplexed and
              intrigued humankind for ages. It has long been a question reserved for philosophers,
              but now some physicists claim to have answered it. Yet these attempts have raised
              questions of their own: is this even a meaningful question in the first place? Can it
              be answered by science alone, or is philosophy necessary? And what will answering the

                  <p>The United Nations predicts human population growth will surpass 9 billion around

              in terms of our continued existence on the planet, with negative environmental effects
              already visible. Limiting the number of children we have seems like one obvious way to
              tackle the problem. But is there a moral imperative to limit reproduction? Is having

                  <p>Addressing our nation’s history of racial injustice can be a truly backbreaking

              colleges and universities often use it in their admissions process. However,
              affirmative action does seem to lower standards for certain under-represented
              minorities like Blacks and Hispanics. Should we think of affirmative action as
              patronizing those minorities, or rectifying the injustices they face? Is affirmative
              action enough to redress racial injustice, or is it simply the best we can do for the
              time being? John and Ken welcome Glenn Loury from Brown University, author of
                <title>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality</title>.</p>

                  <p>Aldous Huxley explains his conception of the brain as a "reducing valve" of
              consciousness in his provocative book, The Doors of Perception. His famous experiment
              with the psychedelic substance mescaline was an attempt to open this valve and expand
              his capacity for knowledge. However, many drugs and psychedelics today are seen as
              simply tools for pleasure or the source of bad habits. Do drugs possess the capability
              to expand our consciousness and provide meaningful insight? Or are they nothing more
              than a route to empty delirium? Ken and guest co-host Alison Gopnik take a trip with
              artist, scientist, and founder of the Beckley Foundation, Amanda Feilding.</p>

                  <p>"Blessed are the sleepy ones," write Nietzsche, "for they shall soon drop off." Sleep
              is an extraordinarily, albeit profoundly odd, phenomenon, yet we seem to accept
              prolonged nightly blackouts without question. Still, sleep has played a major role in
              philosophical thought, with the likes of Aristotle, Locke, and Leibniz putting forth
              theories about just what exactly sleep and dreams are. So what is the purpose of
              sleeping and dreaming? How can we distinguish wakefulness from sleep, as Descartes
              wondered? Do we experience dreams consciously? And do we sleep to live, or live to
              sleep? Ken and guest co-host Jorah Danenberg stay up with Deirdre Barrett from the
              Harvard Medical School, co-author of <title>The Encyclopedia of Sleep and
                Dreams</title>.</p>

                  <p>Many of us generally admire people who donate large sums of money to charity. Yet
              people donate for all sorts of reasons – some selfless, some not so much. Should we
              consider philanthropy as mere ego expression for the wealthy, or is it genuinely
              altruistic behavior? If philanthropists are so concerned with having an impact on
              society, how should we think about "measuring" this impact? Are there better ways than
              philanthropy to achieve positive social change? John and Ken donate their time to

                  <p>Liberal democracy has its problems, including the fact that in trying to build
              consensus, it often ends up oppressing minorities or those who dissent. Radical
              democracy, on the other hand, tries to build consensus around difference, and
              challenge oppressive power relationships. But what are the risks of radical democracy?
              Is it really possible to have a democratic nation state without social conformity? How
              do we ensure both freedom and equality for all citizens in a society? And how does the
              anti-colonial tradition help us rethink what a modern democracy might be like? John
              and Ken join the struggle with Stanford historian Aishwary Kumar, author of
                <title>Radical Equality: Ambedkar, Gandhi, and the Risk of Democracy</title>, in a

                  <p>John Dewey is regarded by some as the American philosopher. In the first half of the
              20th century, he stood as the most prominent public intellectual whose influence
              reached into intellectual movements in China, Japan, and India. Although we hear less
              of Dewey nowadays, his pragmatic political philosophy has influenced the likes of
              Richard Rorty and other political thinkers. What were the basic ideas in his
              philosophy of democracy? Does America have a public sphere? If not, how might we
              recreate a public necessary for democracy? And does the rise of the internet and
              social media fit into Dewey’s ideal democracy? John and Ken idealize a conversation
              with Melvin Rogers from UCLA, author of The Undiscovered Dewey: Religion, Morality,
              and the Ethos of Democracy.</p>

              can we trust our scientific laws? Where do we cross the line from theoretical science
              to metaphysics, and can the two overlap? John and Ken see the light with Priya
              Natarajan from Yale University, author of Mapping the Heavens: The Radical Scientific
              Ideas That Reveal the Cosmos.</p>

                  <p>At the foundation of modern theoretical physics lie the equations that define our
              universe, telling us of its beginnings, evolution, and future. Make even minor
              adjustments to the fundamental laws of the universe, and life as we know it would not
              exist. How do we explain this extraordinary fact that our universe is so uniquely
              fine-tuned for life? Could our universe may be just one of infinitely many in a vast
              multiverse? Does it make sense to talk about other universes if they can never be
              detected from this one? Can science ever prove or disprove the multiverse theory? Or
              does the theory make some testable predictions about our finely-tuned universe? John
              and Ken multiply their thoughts with George Ellis from the University of Cape Town,
              author of How Can Physics Underlie the Mind?</p>

                  <p>In 1994, Congress eliminated federal funding for college education in prisons. It
              was, they argued, unjust for prisoners to be eligible for Pell grants when ordinary
              citizens could not afford higher education. However, research suggests that education
              in prisons has positive consequences, such as lower recidivism rates and an improved
              prison environment. So should we have education programs in prisons? Or is the point
              of prison to punish inmates for their crimes rather than giving them the education
              many non-felons never receive? John and Ken take a lesson from Jennifer Lackey, who
              teaches philosophy at Northwestern University and at Stateville Correctional Center
              near Chicago.</p>

                  <p>In the last few years, conservatives and liberals alike have accused activists on
              college campuses of silencing contrary opinions. Many have argued—quite
              vociferously—that activists’ unwillingness to hear from people with opposing opinions
              endangers freedom of speech in higher education. But is there really an Orwellian
              threat to free speech on college campuses? Are activists’ demands for respect actually
              quashing freedom of thought? And when does one person’s freedom of speech impinge on
              another’s? John and Ken create a safe space for Greg Lukianoff, co-author of "The

                  <p>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual… it is safe to say that new ideas of
              gender and sexuality have broken into mainstream consciousness within the past few
              decades. What underlies each of these identities, however, is the notion of Queerness.
              But what defines what it means to be queer? Is it as much a political identity as it
              is a sexual or gender identity? How does ‘queerness’ subvert or challenge our notions
              of gender and sexuality? John and Ken welcome Susan Stryker from the University of

                  <p>For decades, literary critics have been questioning the relevance of the novel as a

              dead, it’s not clear what new form can take its place. Should we treat the popularity
              of the memoir as a sign that what readers want is more truth, less fiction? Or is the
              memoir, like ‘reality TV,’ mostly just fiction dressed up as fact? In these fragmented
              times, when everything has already been said or done before, can there be any truly
              original innovations in art and literature? Or is the demand for originality itself an
              antiquated idea? John and Ken mix it up with David Shields, author of Reality Hunger:
              A Manifesto. This program was recorded live at the First Congregational Church in
              Portland, Oregon.</p>

                  <p>Phenomenology is the philosophical study of experience and consciousness, performed
              by philosophers ranging from Sartre and Heidegger to contemporary analytic
              philosophers of mind. But what methods do phenomenologists use to study the mind and
              experience in general? How can phenomenology help us understand a range of human
              experiences from agency to awe? And why does neuroscience and cognitive science need
              phenomenology? John and Ken learn what it’s like to talk to Shaun Gallagher from the
              University of Memphis, author of How the Body Shapes the Mind.</p>

                  <p>If beliefs can be described as having a goal or purpose, then surely that is
              something like aiming at the truth. Yet we all hold many false beliefs too. Do these
              false beliefs fail to meet their goal? Or are there some things we believe simply
              because they make us feel good? Could the goal of beliefs sometimes be to provide
              comfort? Or must all beliefs—unlike, say, desires and wishes—be based on some kind of
              justification or evidence? Our host philosophers truly believe their guest is Ray
              Briggs from Stanford University.</p>

                  <p>Human rights—like freedom from discrimination and slavery— are fundamental rights and
              freedoms that every person enjoys simply because they're human. But what about other
              animals, like monkeys, elephants, and dolphins? Should they enjoy similar fundamental
              rights? If we can extend the legal notion of personhood to inanimate, abstract objects
              like corporations, then shouldn’t we also extend it to other sentient creatures? How
              should we understand the concept of a “person” when it’s applied to nonhumans? What
              kind of cognitive and emotional complexity is required for nonhuman personhood? John

                  <p>Jürgen Habermas is regarded as one of the last great public intellectuals of Europe
              and a major contributor to the philosophy of democracy. A member of the Frankfurt
              School, Habermas argues that humans can have rational communication that will lead to
              the democratization of society and consensus. But should we be so optimistic? Why does
              Habermas have faith in our ability to establish this so-called rational communication
              and to reach consensus? And how should we reform our liberal democracies to make them
              more democratic? John and Ken reach for consensus with Matthew Specter from Central
              Connecticut State University, author of Habermas: An Intellectual Biography.</p>

                  <p>Aristotle thought that rationality was the faculty that distinguished humans from
              other animals. However, psychological research shows that our judgments are plagued by
              systematic, irrational, unconscious errors known as ‘cognitive biases.’ In light of
              this research, can we really be confident in the superiority of human rationality? How
              much should we trust our own judgments when we are aware of our susceptibility to bias
              and error? And does our awareness of these biases obligate us to counter them? John

              controlled vehicles. But how do we program these vehicles to act ethically? Should we

                  <p>From airplanes flying overhead to the cellular activity inside us, all events that

              laws affect us? Or is just that what we take to be laws changes over time? Should we

                  <p>In most if not all modern Western societies, monogamy is the dominant form of
              romantic relationship. In polyamorous or "open" relationships, however, each person is
              free to love multiple partners at once. Just as our friendships are non-exclusive,
              advocates of polyamory believe our romantic relationship should be too. So why do so
              many people find polyamory distasteful, or even despicable? Is it immoral to love more
              than one person at a time? Or is our society's commitment to monogamy simply a fossil
              of tradition that could one day be obsolete? The Philosophers welcome back Carrie
              Jenkins from the University of British Columbia, author of What Love Is: And What It
              Could Be.</p>

                  <p>Work: a lot lot of people do it, and a lot of people don’t seem to like it very much.
              But as computers and artificial intelligence get increasingly sophisticated, more and
              more of our workers will lose their jobs to technology. Should we view this
              inevitability with hope or with despair? Without the order and purpose that meaningful
              work provides in our lives, would we end up bored and restless? What obligations does
              government have to deal with these changes? What about providing all citizens with a
              basic income? The Philosophers work hard with Juliana Bidadanure from Stanford

                  <p>Smart TVs, refrigerators, cars, and houses—the internet of things refers to the
              networking of all the devices in our lives, as they gather data and interact with one
              another, apparently to make our lives easier. How will this augmented connectivity
              affect the way we live? If government agencies or hackers can potentially access the
              data our devices gather, what will become of privacy? Josh and Ken get smart with

                  <p>Started in the wake of George Zimmerman's 2013 acquittal in the death of Trayvon
              Martin, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has become a powerful campaign demanding
              redress for the mistreatment of African-Americans by law enforcement in the United
              States. But it has also inspired deep antipathy from those who claim it overemphasizes
              racial issues. So how much does – and should – race matter? Does #BlackLivesMatter
              speak for all black people? How should we respond to counter-movements like
              #AllLivesMatter? Ken and Debra discuss matters with Chris Lebron from Johns Hopkins
              University, author of The Making of Black Lives Matter: A Brief History of an
              Idea.</p>

                  <p>"One man's trash is another man's treasure," or so the saying goes. But what makes
              something trash to begin with? The word can be used to describe disposable objects,
              pieces of culture, or even people. Underlying each of these uses, however, are
              feelings of indifference, disdain, or disgust. How do the things that we call trash
              reflect our values, as individuals, and as a society? What can we learn about
              ourselves by examining the things we deem worthy of throwing away? The Philosophers go
              dumpster diving with Elizabeth Spelman from Smith College, author of Trash Talks:

                  <p>Free speech is one of the core tenets of our democracy. We’re inclined to think that
              more speech is always better. Although the Supreme Court has outlined some minor
              restrictions to our right to free speech, the most courts are willing to admit is that
              speech can lead to violence—it cannot itself do violence. But is it possible for
              speech to do both? If hate speech is used against a marginalized group, couldn’t the
              speech act literally do harm? And how does the answer to this question affect our
              commitment to free speech in a liberal democracy? The Philosophers do no harm with

                  <p>Many of us look forward to retirement, that time in life when we stop working for a
              living. But what exactly is retirement and why do we retire? Does retirement always
              mean an end to work, or can it sometimes just mean a shift to a different kind of
              work? Ought we retire for purely selfish reasons, such as to give ourselves more
              leisure time? Or ought we retire for the public good, to give younger people greater
              opportunities for employment?</p>

                  <p>Despite tremendous strides made towards civil and political rights in the United
              States, discrimination and exclusion based on race, class, gender, and sexuality are
              still pervasive. As a result, individuals seen as "the other" often experience a
              painful inner fracturing W.E.B. Du Bois called "double consciousness." So, how does
              one shape a coherent identity in a world where one is considered "other"? What effects
              do micro aggressions have on the ability to develop a unified self? And what role
              might community play in helping heal fractured identities? The Philosophers identify
              with Julie Lythcott-Haims, author of Real American: A Memoir.</p>

                  <p>Frantz Fanon is a thinker who has inspired radical liberation movements in places
              ranging from Palestine to South Africa to the United States. Most famous for his work
              The Wretched of the Earth, Fanon is often understood as a proponent of revolutionary
              violence. But is this a fair characterization of Fanon, or is it an oversimplification
              of a deeper and richer body of work? What exactly is Fanon’s philosophy of violence,
              and how does it relate to his philosophy and psychology of the colonial subject? How
              has Fanon shaped how we think of identity politics? The Philosophers welcome Nigel
              Gibson from Emerson College, author of Fanon: The Postcolonial Imagination.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes, we struggle to tell the truth -- especially when it's the truth about
              ourselves. Why did James Baldwin, a prominent Civil Rights-era intellectual and
              novelist, believe that telling the truth about ourselves is not only difficult but can
              also be dangerous? How can truth deeply unsettle our assumptions about ourselves and
              our relations to others? And why did Baldwin think that this abstract concept of truth
              could play a concrete role in social justice? The Philosophers seek their own truth
              with Christopher Freeburg from the University of Illinois, author of Black Aesthetics
              and the Interior Life.</p>

                  <p>With the recent #MeToo viral campaign, along with the wave of prominent male figures
              toppled for being serial sexual harassers or worse, the topic of misogyny has come

              What set of beliefs or attitudes makes someone a misogynist? And why does misogyny
              persist despite the fact that traditional gender roles are being abandoned more and

                  <p>People like to argue, especially Philosophy Talk listeners! But no matter how hard we
              try to resolve disputes through rational discourse, sometimes we may still disagree
              about important issues. One response to this predicament is simply to agree to
              disagree. But should the mere fact of disagreement lower our confidence in our views?
              Should we change how we judge our own beliefs when we realize that other people
              disagree? Or do we only have reason to doubt our beliefs when we learn that experts
              disagree with us? The Philosophy Talk hosts humbly welcome Nathan Ballantyne from

              Popular cultures pervades modern life. But what if pop culture was actually more
              pernicious than we ordinarily think? Could it be systematically deceiving us—eroding
              our ability to think for ourselves and fight for change? That's what the 20th century
              German philosopher Theodor Adorno thought. The Philosophers get cultured on Adorno's

                  <p>Open up any online comments section and you’ll find them: internet trolls, from the
              mildly inflammatory to the viciously bullying. It seems that the ease of posting
              online leads many to abandon any semblance of intellectual humility. So can we have
              intellectual humility on an anonymous forum with little oversight and accountability?
              Does current online behavior portend the end of humility in the public domain? How do
              we encourage greater humility and less arrogance in any public discourse? The
              Philosophers open up the comments section for Michael Lynch from the University of
              Connecticut, author of The Internet of Us: Knowing More and Understanding Less in the
              Age of Big Data.</p>
