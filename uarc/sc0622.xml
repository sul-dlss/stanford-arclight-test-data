         <p>Jack L. Shepard earned three degrees at Stanford University: A.B. (1953) and A.M. (1955) in education and MBA at Stanford's Graduate School of Business in 1956. As a student he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and on the varsity baseball team. After his undergraduate degree, Shepard played baseball with the Pittsburgh Pirates and in his first full season (1954) was named "Rookie of the Year." After leaving the Pirates, he joined the Stanford University fund-raising staff as an associate general secretary, a post he held for nine years.</p>
