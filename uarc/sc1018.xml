         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The Stanford Alpine Club was one of America's prominent college climbing clubs. Its
        identity was forged in the crucible of Yosemite Valley's smooth, steep granite. Members made
        important contributions to the development of modern Yosemite rockclimbing technique and
        helped carry the lessons learned to the world's great ranges. Coeducational membership was
        another factor distinguishing the SAC from the longer-established and better-known eastern
        clubs, and a tradition of "manless climbing" dated from the club's 1946 inaugural year.</p>
         <p>Through the summer of 1946, Larry Taylor worked on plans to form a climbing club at
        Stanford when he returned for graduate work in civil engineering. Then in August he chanced
        upon Al Baxter buying hobnails in the campus shoe shop, giving himself away as a mountain
        climber. "Though he had never done any roped climbing," wrote Taylor, "Al was at once
        enthusiastic about my plan; indeed it was his enthusiasm which had a great deal to do with
        the actual carrying out of the idea." The third founding member, Fritz Lippmann, the only
        experienced climber of the group, Taylor had met during Sierra Club Rock Climbing Section
        outings.</p>
         <p>The personal connections and corporate traditions that bound one class to another became
        the SAC's strength. One such connection was between founder Fritz Lippmann and Dave Harrah,
        and then between Harrah and members who would become club leaders into the 1950s, including
        Jon Lindbergh and Nick Clinch. Lindbergh, Clinch, Dwight Crowder, Sherman Lehman, and
        Rowland Tabor were examples of the club's ability to attract, train, and retain a nucleus of
        leaders that would guide it through the fifties in the form established by the founders,
        strengthened by Harrah, and carried on by a cadre of new club presidents with a shared
        vision and commitment to the club.</p>
         <p>Women climbers had distinguished themselves beginning in the club's first year when Mary
        Sherrill and Freddy Hubbard became the third and fourth women to climb to the top of Higher
        Cathedral Spire in Yosemite Valley. Later Hubbard made the first ascent by a woman of the
        Washington Column Direct Route. The club's tradition of "manless" climbing dated from 1947.
        In 1952 Jane Noble, Mary Kay Pottinger, Gail Fleming, and Bea Vogel made ascents of Mt.
        Moran, the North Ridge of Middle Teton, and the Southwest Ridge of Symmetry Spire. In 1965
        Irene Beardsley and Sue Swedlund made the first all-woman climb of the awesome North Face of
        the Grand Teton, the most famous north face in the United States. Climbing historian Chris
        Jones called that adventure "probably the most arduous all-woman ascent then made in North
        America," and Beardsley "one of America's best women climbers."</p>
         <p>Freddy Hubbard and her Roble Hall companions were not merely beneficiaries of the new
        club's coed-friendly attitude. Experienced mountaineers all, they were important
        contributors to the SAC's success.</p>
         <p>Throughout the 1957/58 school year Mike Roberts, Lennie Lamb, Henry Kendall, Dave Sowles,
        and Gil Roberts were working on their contributions to a new edition of the Stanford Alpine
        Club Journal. Gil Roberts, back from his summer first ascent of Mt. Logan's East Ridge, was
        also planning to join Nick Clinch's 1958 American Karakoram Expedition to Gasherbrum I.</p>
         <p>In addition to the challenge of the great Himalayan peaks, a second test of American
        mountaineering beckoned. The most severe routes of the Alps, including the Walker Spur of
        the Grandes Jorasses and the Eigerwand, awaited American ascents, as did major lines and
        faces yet unclimbed. Club members were learning skills and forging relationships that would
        help them accomplish these mountaineering goals. John Harlin and Gary Hemming would lead the
        way in a breakthrough for Americans climbing in the European Alps. Kendall joined Hemming on
        the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses, the first American ascent of that classic climb, "a
        route to dream of, perhaps the finest in existence." Frost joined them on some of their
        greatest first ascents: the South Face of the Fou and the Hidden Pillar of Fréney. These
        adventures on great mountains had their beginnings in small places, on Sunday outings to
        Miraloma Rock and Hunter's Hill, with the Stanford Alpine Club. </p>
         <p>The SAC continued throughout the sixties in a form that would have been recognizable and
        familiar to all earlier members, albeit the overall membership was smaller than in many
        earlier periods, no more than 15-20 members. The change in Yosemite sign-out rules in the
        mid-sixties, along with the growing number of climbers, development of commercial climbing
        schools, production of guidebooks, and availability and relative affordability of climbing
        equipment contributed to a situation where many Stanford climbers were pursuing their goals
        independently.</p>
         <p>Leigh Ortenburger's connection with the Stanford Alpine Club extended over some thirty
        years. Bob Brooke described him as the holder of a long-time record for non-dues-paying
        participation in Stanford activities. He had not been a Stanford undergraduate, nor had he
        learned to climb in the club. He was already a Teton guide when he first climbed with
        Clinch, John Mowat, and Dick Irvin in the Tetons in 1951. Ortenburger's SAC connection
        developed when he came out to Berkeley for graduate school in the fall of that year,
        climbing with the same trio in Yosemite Valley. He shared apartments with Al Baxter and
        later Dick Irvin, attending practice climbs, parties, and dating Stanford coed climbers. He
        married Irene Beardsley in 1956. Gil Roberts told of his influence in the early fifties:</p>
         <p>He was a couple of years older and he was very experienced. He'd been to Peru and he'd done
        new routes in the Tetons. So he certainly was one of the guys that was setting the pace on
        club trips. . . . Leigh was an excellent climber and everybody respected him.</p>
         <p>In the sixties Ortenburger earned a master's degree from Stanford and did course work for a
        Ph.D. Throughout the sixties and seventies he sometimes attended club meetings and climbed
        with Stanford climbers. Probably no other person had such a long-term connection with the
        club. Leigh Ortenburger Photographer.</p>
         <p>In the summer of 1952, while still in high school, Irene Beardsley traveled with her
        parents by car west to Stanford from her Washington, D.C. home. Viewing the eastern
        escarpment of Wyoming's Teton mountains, jutting six thousand feet above Jackson Hole, she
        knew that people climbed those imposing rock and snow summits. She was intrigued. She was
        also occupied just then by other dreams. She wanted to study physics:</p>
         <p>My mother wanted me to go to Mills, but I wanted to go to Stanford. It was just something I
        decided to do because of their reputation in physics. And I got interested in the SAC
        because when I was in my freshman year I looked around for various social activities and
        didn't find any that fit. I remember an embarrassing interview when I tried out for some
        kind of political sort of thing; I wasn't the right type, and they told me so. I next saw an
        advertisement in the Daily for the Alpine Club, and I went to a practice climb at Miraloma
        Park in San Francisco. I wasn't very good.</p>
         <p>While becoming the fourth woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford in 1965, she made
        hundreds of ascents beginning in the 1950s, including notable firsts as the 1965 first
        all-woman climb of the North Face of the Grand Teton, the most famous north face in the
        United States, and the 1978 first American ascent of Annapurna (26,545 ft).</p>
         <p>The SAC continued throughout the sixties in a form that would have been recognizable and
        familiar to all earlier members, albeit the overall membership was smaller than in many
        earlier periods, no more than 15-20 members. The change in Yosemite sign-out rules in the
        mid-sixties, along with the growing number of climbers, development of commercial climbing
        schools, production of guidebooks, and availability and relative affordability of climbing
        equipment contributed to a situation where many Stanford climbers were pursuing their goals
        independently.</p>
         <p>Sixties outings sounded pretty much like old times: Belay practice was held in the San
        Francisquito creek bed near the shopping center and Children's Hospital--as it had been
        since 1950--at the beginning of fall quarter and sometimes spring quarter as well. It was
        still required of members who aspired to climb in Yosemite. The raising through a pulley and
        dropping of a hundred-pound block of concrete, testing the technique of well-anchored and
        padded belayers, presented an entertaining spectacle. "Belay practice was always a jolly
        event which attracted a fairly large crowd of both participants and spectators," Russ Van
        Dyke, president in 1969/70 and 1970/71, recalled. The principal social events were beach
        trips and club parties, still called Bergsteiger balls through the mid-sixties. Folk dancing
        and sing-alongs were regular activities at the latter. One-third of the active members were
        women. Meetings, held several times a quarter, sometimes included slide shows by members or
        guests and were the forum at which club outings were planned, including Yosemite trips,
        which were made at least four times during the fall and spring quarters.</p>
         <p>In 1969 Chuck Kroger, SAC president 1968/69, became the first person to climb four routes
        on El Capitan in a single season, including the third ascent of the menacing North America
        Wall, widely considered the most difficult rock climb in the world. Scott Davis, '70, joined
        Kroger on three of those climbs: the NA, West Buttress, and Dihedral Wall. Kroger and Davis,
        two of the finest big-wall climbers in the country, capped their El Cap tour de force with
        the first ascent of the Heart Route in April 1970.</p>
         <p>Davis was a foreshadowing of the club's future. "I sort of thought I was a member," he
        concluded some thirty years later, though on another occasion he conceded that he may not
        have been an official member. "The 1960s were pretty informal," he added. Davis participated
        in club activities and regularly climbed with club members, especially with Kroger, who
        counted Davis among the SAC ranks. Another example of the amorphousness of the situation in
        the late sixties and the seventies was Walt Vennum, a geology graduate student from 1966 to
        1971. During his Stanford years he made first ascents in Alaska and the Sierra Nevada, and
        listed himself in published climbing notes as "unaffiliated." "I don't think I was
        officially a member of the SAC," Vennum said. "I climbed with a lot of people who were in
        the club. It was a pretty fluid situation."</p>
         <p>Jim Collins, sporting his distinctive leather cap, shorts, tube socks, and EB rock shoes,
        was a familiar campus sight in the late 1970s, cruising the back wall of Building 260 or the
        Art Gallery. Collins, an applied math major, never had so much to do that he wouldn't take
        time out of his regimen to encourage and advise another wall climber. "The University is the
        ideal place for practicing rockclimbing by way of buildering--the art of climbing walls,"
        Collins told a Stanford Daily interviewer in 1979. "The sandstone blocks are ideal for
        climbing, though extremely difficult. In fact, the most difficult rockclimbing challenge in
        the world is in the Quad."</p>
         <p>Buildering flourished on campus from the club's beginning in 1946: roofs were scaled and
        rappelled from, walls were traversed, and Freddy Hubbard rappelled out of her Roble Hall
        second-floor dorm window in order to make a pre-morning-curfew start for the crags. What
        distinguished the Stanford's post-War buildering history from earlier times was the
        application of climbing technique and technical rope work to the local problems.</p>
         <p>All the causes and effects of forces shaping club history and society at large in the
        sixties intensified in the seventies. Roger Gocking, Darien Hopkins, Jim Collins, Rob
        Bracken, Greg Larson and other club officers each attempted to make the club relevant, and
        different solutions were tried. Despite their efforts club activities lapsed during 1975/76
        and a few years later in 1980/81. Resurrected once again, it disappeared after the 1982/83
        school year. Gocking described the Stanford climbing scene in the early seventies:</p>
         <p>The club had played several roles. One was it provided a basic introduction to
        rockclimbing, and it helped to provide the logistics for climbing. People would pool their
        cars, equipment, and all those sorts of things. And then too, it was something of a social
        club. People met one another. I remember talking to Leigh Ortenburger about this, and his
        observation was that a lot of people got married as a result. When I was president that role
        was beginning to change. The better climbers didn't feel the need to belong. They were off
        doing their own things. Climbing levels continued to rise. There was a big gap between
        club-type activities and what many people were themselves climbing. I think that people who
        were serious didn't want to be involved in something like a climbing club, which didn't
        really cater to what they were doing.</p>
         <p>The End: Greg Larson, Tresidder Union recreation manager, championed student voluntary
        outdoor groups in general and the SAC in particular, which he and Steve D'Hondt
        reestablished in 1981. Having been inspired to try out rockclimbing by a Jim Collins
        presentation, and having learned to climb with the SAC, Larson fondly remembered the
        trip-taking and camaraderie. Larson and D'Hondt rejuvenated the SAC to fill the need for
        rockclimbing instruction. Larson took the title of coordinator. They organized ten
        instructional climbs at local outcrops that year, along with the showing of climbing films
        and a presentation by Jim Collins. After Larson's departure, D'Hondt took over as club
        coordinator for 1982/83, repeating the previous year's pattern of activities. The club,
        however, disappeared during the next school year.</p>
