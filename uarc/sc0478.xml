         <p>These papers largely pertain to Frank Weymouth, his first wife Alice Jenkins, and other members of the Jenkins family. Frank Weymouth was educated at Stanford University, earning his a.b. in zoology in 1909, his M.A. in physiology in 1911, and his doctorate in 1923. He joined the faculty of the physiology department in 1910, was appointed Professor in 1931, and served as head of the department from 1938-1949. At his retirement in 1949, he was appointed Professor Emeritus. He died in 1963. In 1912 he married Alice Mabel Jenkins, who earned her a.b. in physiology at Stanford in 1911. Her father, Oliver P. Jenkins, was a member of Stanford's first faculty and the first chairman of the physiology department. Alice Jenkins Weymouth died in 1933; in 1943 Frank Weymouth married Mary Balsbough Deirup.</p>
