         <p>The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (also known as Stanford AI Lab or SAIL) is
        the artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory of Stanford University. It was started
        in 1963 by John McCarthy, after he moved from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
        Stanford. From 1965 to 1980, it was housed in the D.C. Power building, in the foothills of
        the Santa Cruz Mountains overlooking Stanford. During this period it was one of the leading
        centers for AI research. In 1980, its activities were merged into the university's Computer
        Science Department and it moved into Margaret Jacks Hall in the main Stanford campus. SAIL
        was reopened in 2004, with Sebastian Thrun becoming its new director. SAIL's 21st century
        mission is to "change the way we understand the world"; its researchers contribute to fields
        such as bioinformatics, cognition, computational geometry, computer vision, decision theory,
        distributed systems, game theory, general game playing, image processing, information
        retrieval, knowledge systems, logic, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural
        language, neural networks, planning, probabilistic inference, sensor networks, and
        robotics.</p>

               <p>DART was a program that saved disk files on magnetic tape and restored files from tape
            to disk. DART was used to make periodic backups of the file disk, approximately once a
            week for the permanent backups.</p>

                  <p>Paul W. Braisted, "Prototype Moon Rover," B&amp;W, silent, fast motion, 9
              minutes.</p>
                  <p>Mechanical Engineering graduate student Paul W. Braisted devised a scheme to improve
              the controllability from Earth of a Moon rover taking into account the 2.6 second
              round trip communication delay. It had an analog computer that functioned as a
              predictor that took into account preceding steering commands and put a bright dot on
              the television screen at the predicted location of the cart when a current steering
              command would begin to take effect. With this feature the vehicle could be controlled
              at 5 mph (8 kph). These experiments were conducted on the playing fields of Stanford
              and the speed of the cart was chosen to match the sustainable jogging speed of a
              graduate student. For more on the Stanford Cart see

                  <p>Hans Moravec, "Stanford Cart", color, silent, 1.5 minutes.</p>
                  <p>The Stanford Cart was an experimental mobile vehicle whose television camera could
              move from side to side, allowing multiple views to be obtained without moving the
              wheels. Images were sent to a DEC KL10 computer, which interpreted the
              three-dimensional information and directed the cart to navigate around obstacles. The
              cart moved in one meter spurts punctuated by ten to fifteen minute pauses for image
              processing and route planning. In 1979, the cart successfully crossed a chair-filled
              room without human intervention in about five hours, as shown here.</p>

                  <p>The robot hand solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using only four blocks instead of
              disks. The pauses between hand motions are due to the trajectory planning for the next
              move, including dynamics and control parameters, which is performed before the hand
              moves. Notice that the hand turns and re-grasps the block it just placed to ensure
              that each stack remains centered.</p>

                  <p>Describes the state of the speech recognition project as of Spring, 1969. A
              discussion of the problems of speech recognition is followed by two real time
              demonstrations of the current system. The first shows the computer learning to
              recognize phrases and second shows how the hand-eye system may be controlled by voice
              commands. Commands as complicated as "Pick up the small block in the lower left-hand
              corner", are recognized and the tasks are carried out by the computer controlled
              arm.</p>

              silent, 6 minutes.</p>
                  <p>Shown at the Second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)
              in London.</p>
                  <p>A computer vision system and robotic arm solve the Instant Insanity puzzle, which has
              been around for more than a century under various aliases. It consists of a set of
              four cubes with one of four colors on each of their six faces. The goal is to arrange
              the four cubes in a row so that all four colors appear on each of the row's four long
              sides. The order of the cubes doesn't matter, but that simplicity is deceptive. There
              are 41,472 different ways of arranging the four cubes in a row, so this is not a
              trivial task.</p>
                  <p>The computer vision system first finds each of the four cubes by matching the visual
              edges to a prototype cube. In the case of a cube with only two faces visible, the arm
              turns the cube 45º so that three faces will be visible. The colors of the faces are
              then determined by reading in the scene again under three different color filters. The
              cubes are then turned over so that the three hidden back faces are visible to the
              camera and the process repeated. Once a solution is found the computer directs the arm
              to stack the blocks in the required order.</p>

                        <p>Mike Montemerlo was recognized for leadership and technical contributions that
                  led to the DARPA Grand Challenge victory. Michael Montemerlo is being recognized
                  for his leadership in Stanford Autonomous Driving Team, which led to the victory
                  in the DARPA Grand Challenge. Mike was the chief software architect of the system,
                  and his work influenced all aspects of Stanley's software, from hardware
                  interfaces, perception, mapping, path planning, and control. Mike was the
                  technical leader for the entire team, and his vision and technical strength guided
                  all other team members in this successful project. The DARPA Grand Challenge was
                  widely considered a milestone event for robotics. For the first time, robotic cars
                  proved their ability to navigate extensive desert trails completely
                  autonomously.</p>

                        <p>Honored for computer algorithms that led to the DARPA Grand Challenge victory.
                  For his groundbreaking contributions to the winning DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle,
                  and in particular his algorithms for adaptive speed control. His adaptive speed
                  control algOlithm selected the best speed autonomously with machine learning,
                  considering features such as road roughness, slope, and width. The algorithm could
                  be trained to closely match a human driver's speed choices. This allowed Stanford
                  to avoid massive human-tweaking of the race route, known as "pre-planning," that
                  characterized some other teams. The algorithm includes a band-pass filter,
                  designed by Gabe Hoffmann, to isolate the vehicle's suspension. David made
                  contributions to several other aspects of the robot, including the watchdog
                  program for software health monitoring and the adaptive vision system. In
                  addition, David was on the launch team responsible for the vehicle on the morning
                  of the race and, as TA for the Grand Challenge class, oversaw the very first
                  end-to-end development of Stanley. He was also the principal safety driver for
                  in-the-desert road tests. His other responsibilities included team coordination
                  and media and investor relations. Using data from the event, David later published
                  a self-taught learning algorithm that used haptic feedback from the IMU to enhance
                  the laser perception beyond race performance.</p>

                        <p>For computer vision that led to the DARPA Grand Challenge victory. For his
                  contributions to Stanford's autonomous vehicle Stanley, and specifically its
                  computer vision system for long-range road detection. Called Stanford's "secret
                  weapon" by a PBS documentary on the DARPA Grand Challenge, this system enabled
                  Stanley to perceive and classify desert terrain in the distance as drivable or
                  undrivable, and determine a safe traversal speed. The algorithm was a crucial
                  contribution in two ways: First, it allowed Stanley to extend its sensing range
                  from a classical laser-based perception range of 20 meters to a camera-based range
                  of 40 meters, which led to a 40% increase in top speed and a win in the race.
                  Second, it advanced a new paradigm in ru1ificial intelligence called
                  "self-supervised learning", where the output of one sensor modality, the laser
                  range finder, is used to generate online training data for a second sensor
                  modality, the camera. This allowed Stanley to constantly adjust its road model to
                  the environment, taking time-of-day, surface material, texture, shadows etc into
                  account. Together with Intel Computer Vision Researcher Adrian Kaehler, Hendrik
                  implemented a perception system that was able to react even to obstacles such as
                  tank traps that it had never encountered before.</p>

                        <p>Pieter Abbeel for acrobatic flight maneuvers of the Stanford autonomous
                  helicopter. Autonomous helicopter flight is widely regarded to be a highly
                  challenging control problem. It is particularly difficult to design controllers
                  for non-stationary maneuvers in which the helicopter goes through various flight
                  regimes, extensively exposing the great complexity of helicopter dynamics. Despite
                  these challenges, human experts can reliably fly helicopters through a wide range
                  of maneuvers, including aerobatic maneuvers at the edge of the helicopter's
                  capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Pieter Abbeel and Adam Coates developed apprenticeship learning algorithms that
                  leverage expert demonstrations to efficiently learn good controllers for the tasks

                  enabled their helicopters to significantly extend the state of the art in
                  autonomous helicopter flight and aerobatics. Their experimental results included
                  the first autonomous execution of a wide range of maneuvers, including flips,
                  rolls, loops, auto-rotation landings, chaos and tictocs, which only exceptional
                  human pilots can perform. Their results also included complete air shows, which
                  required autonomous transitions between many of these maneuvers. Their system

                        <p>Ken Salisbury for the design and build-up of the Salisbury robotic hand. Ken
                  Salisbury designed the "Salisbury Hand" (originally known as the Stanford/JPL
                  hand) while he was a graduate student at Stanford as an advisee of Prof. Bernie
                  Roth in Mechanical Engineering. In collaboration with Carl Ruoff at NASA/Jet
                  Propulsion Labs and Prof. Roth, the hand was designed to be a platform for
                  investigation of robotic grasping and dexterous manipulation. Commercialized
                  through Ken's "Salisbury Robotics" company in the early 80's this hand became a
                  popular research platform for many years and continues to be an icon symbolic of
                  robotic dexterity. In the years since, Ken's labs have spawned an number of
                  well-known robotic and haptic devices, including the MIT-W AM arm (now known as
                  the Barrett Arm from Barrett Technology), the PHANToM Haptic Interface from
                  Sensable Technology, telesurgical devices commercialized by Intuitive Surgical,
                  and most recently the first version of the Personal Robot that is now being
                  commercialized by Willow Garage.</p>

                        <p>Dan Klein for revolutionary contributions to unsupervised probabilistic language
                  parsing. Dan Klein wins this award for his pioneering contributions to the
                  unsupervised learning of natural language structure. Klein's thesis work
                  demonstrated the first computer system capable of acquiring high-quality grammars
                  from raw text alone, answering a long-standing open question about the
                  empiricallearnability of human languages. Along with his group at UC Berkeley, he
                  has since continued to advance the state of the art in natural language processing
                  using unsupervised and latent-variable methods. In addition to constructing fast
                  and accurate syntactic analysis systems, his recent research has successfully
                  tackled a variety of other language tasks. In the area of machine translation, for
                  example, his work OIL syntactic correspondence has produced the best systems for
                  learning latent translation alignments. In the area of reference resolution, his
                  research has led to a fully unsupervised system that outperforms its supervised
                  competitors. Recent results on historical reconstruction have demonstrated the
                  most accurate system for the automatic inference of ancestral words from modern
                  forms. Klein is the recipient of multiple academic honors, most recently including
                  the ACM Grace Murray Hopper award, a Microsoft New Faculty Fellowship, a Sloan
                  Fellowship, and multiple best paper awards.</p>

                  records and making them accessible for the long term is a difficult task both
                  because digital recordings, especially those on magnetic media, don't last long
                  and because write/read technologies keep changing as do file formats. Bruce
                  Baumgart, with help from Martin Frost and others, has been able to preserve most
                  of the records of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab from the 1970s and '80s
                  and has made the public files from that period publicly accessible on <extref actuate="onrequest"

                  owners via logins. He did this with a great deal of personal effort and at his own
                  expense. The problem of preserving such records for the very long term, as we
                  believe they should be, is not yet solved but this effort constitutes a big step
                  in the right direction.</p>

                        <p>John Chowning for creating the computer music synthesis system John Chowning
                  initiated the computer music project at SAIL, with the indispensable help of
                  undergrad student David Poole, that became the internationally recognized Center
                  for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). Along the way he discovered
                  a frequency modulation scheme that could closely emulated the sounds of known
                  musical instruments and many that are unknown. Software was not patentable at that
                  time so he recruited grad student Andy Moorer to translate it into a hardware
                  design that was patented through Stanford and licensed to Yamaha, which eventually
                  incorporated it into a wide range of digital synthesis devices, from organs to
                  cell phones, including the most widely sold synthesizer ever, the DX 7. The
                  proceeds from that licensing agreement helped CCRMA get through a critical phase
                  of its development-including the acquisition of the Foonly F2, built by David
                  Poole-and eventually endow the ongoing programs at CCRMA.</p>

                        <p>Whitfield Diffie for initiating the public key cryptography development.
                  Whitfield Diffie originated the important idea of public key cryptography, which
                  he then turned into a PhD dissertation and inspired others, such as SAIL alumnus
                  Ron Rivest to further develop this idea. The creation of practical public key
                  encryption systems has had a big effect on protecting personal privacy and moving
                  away from the idea that only governmental agencies have the right to encrypt and
                  protect their records.</p>

                        <p>Les Earnest for helping to start ARPAnet and creating the social networking
                  program FINGER. During 1967-68 Les Earnest was a member of the ten person startup
                  committee for the first packet switching network, which came to be called ARPAnet
                  and later turned into the Internet. Their initial performance specifications were
                  not too foresighted in that only two functions were specified: file transfer and
                  remote computing, which came to be called Telnet. However the file transfer
                  capability was adequate to support email when it came into use a short time later
                  and the tight round trip communication requirement needed for Telnet made possible
                  the much later interactive web services.</p>
                        <p>In the 1970s Les created the FINGER program, which could show who was currently
                  logged in and, if not, when they last logged out. This was to help keep track of
                  SAIL people who worked at all hours of the day and night. Given that nearly all
                  SAIL software was made publicly accessible, a number of other laboratories with
                  similar computer systems took copies of FINGER for their own use and soon
                  requested that a network versioij be developed that could check on people at other
                  sites, which Mark Crispin developed. FINGER also allowed each person to create a
                  Plan file, tied to their email address, to describe such things as their planned
                  work schedule or vacation plans. However in short order FINGER became a de facto
                  social networking system, given that it facilitated finding which of one's friends
                  were online and allowed people to post what amounted to personal blogs some 30
                  years before the term "blog" came into use. For more see <extref actuate="onrequest"

                  A Unix version was created by a UC Berkeley group that unfortunately had a
                  security loophole that was exploited by the first Internet Worm, resulting in
                  FINGER being suppressed on security grounds. Google is now developing a modem
                  version called WEBFINGER.</p>

                        <p>Ralph Gorin for creating the first spelling corrector. The first spelling checker
                  was created at MIT in 1961 by Les Earnest as part of the first cursive handwriting
                  recognizer and used a list of the 10,000 most common English words. In 1967
                  Earnest recruited a SAIL graduate student to make a spelling checker for text
                  files, which was written in LISP, used a suffix stripping scheme to effectively
                  increase the vocabulary of the word list, and rather slowly produced a list of
                  unrecognized words and their locations in the file. In 1971 Eamest recruited Ralph
                  Gorin to make an interactive spelling checker. Gorin wrote SPELL in machine
                  language, for faster action and made the first spelling corrector by searching the
                  word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or
                  adjacent letter transpositions. The program became more useful by allowing each
                  user to extend the dictionary interactively and use those extensions in the
                  future. He made SPELL publicly accessible and it soon spread around the world via
                  the new ARPAnet, about ten years before personal computers came into general
                  use.</p>

                        <p>Anthony Hearn for creating the Standard Lisp System. After the Lisp programming
                  language was created by John McCarthy and his colleagues at MIT during the late
                  1950s, it became the most widely used language in artificial intelligence research
                  because of its versatility and extensibility. However its extensibility became a
                  problem as many different versions began to appear which were incompatible with
                  each other. After Tony Hearn began developing a symbolic computation system called
                  REDUCE, he addressed this problem by creating and documenting Standard Lisp in an
                  attempt to bring the diverging branches back together. This idea was later picked
                  up by others to create Common Lisp.</p>

                  learned from his pneumatic snake like digital arm (the ORM-1966), and a powerful
                  and fast hydraulic arm (1967) which ran in "spacewar mode" and shook the building
                  that the design of the robot needed to be compatible with the brain and it's
                  environment. His electric "Stanford Arm" (1969) became the Hand-Eye group standard
                  research robot manipulator for many years. He built several of these arms for
                  other research groups including General Motors, National Bureau of Standards (now
                  NIST), and AT&amp;T. He also had a strong hand in the development of Hans Moravec
                  's cart. The MIT AI Lab wanted their own robot so in 1973 he designed the "MIT
                  Arm" which he commercialized as the PUMA robot (Vicarm, Unimation, Westinghouse,
                  Staubli). The first, delivered to General Motors, is now in the Smithsonian
                  collection. Fortune called him the "Father of the Modern Robot" (1980). More
                  recently (2009), the IET (UK) named him "Godfather of Robotics".</p>

                        <p>Dan Swinehart for contributions to the SAIL programming language. The SAIL
                  programming language and system was developed in the late 1960's by Bob Sproull
                  and Dan Swinehart, with later contributions by Jim Low, Hanan Samet, Russ Taylor,
                  Kurt van Lehn and others too numerous to mention. Derived from a class project,
                  called Gogol, the language began with something resembling Algol-60 and then
                  layered on contributions from many emerging language trends, including associative
                  processing (based on Feldman's LEAP), records (typed compound data structures),
                  references (typed pointers to same), support for multiple threads, and
                  variable-length strings with automatic storage management, the latter inspired by
                  a Bill McKeeman PUI-like project on campus. The system was coded entirely in Phil
                  Petit's FAIL assembly language to support hard-core systems applications for which
                  LISP and other available languages were arguably inappropriate. Among others,
                  notable well-known applications developed in SAIL include Larry Tesler's PUB and
                  early versions of Don Knuth's even more ambitious TEX document composition
                  systems.</p>

                        <p>Larry Tesler for creating the PUB document compiler. In 1971, Les Earnest
                  recruited Larry Tesler to create a document compiler that would go well beyond
                  RUNOFF by supporting advanced publishing features. The software Larry built during
                  the ensuing six months featured automatic numbering, headings, multiple columns,
                  figures, footnotes, front and back matter generation, and cross-references. Its
                  power was unprecedented. It also was evidently the first document compiler that
                  provided for embedded spreadsheets. Today, we would call it a "scriptable markup
                  language". The scripting language was a subset of SAIL. In that pre-SGML era, the
                  markup syntax was non-uniform but it did allow arbitrary text to be bracketed by
                  tags.</p>
                        <p>Because it was written in SAIL and because its syntax required use of the entire
                  SAIL character set, the audience for PUB was limited. Nevertheless, at
                  ARPANET-connected universities with PDP-lOs, many a thesis was formatted using
                  PUB. Because the code was open-source, Russ Taylor added FR-80 microfilm output
                  and Rich Johnsson of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) added font capabilities.</p>
                        <p>As with other markup languages, the output was often difficult to predict. At
                  least two PUB users reacted to these shortcomings by developing better languages.
                  Brian Reid, then at CMU, developed Scribe for nontechnical users. He implemented
                  the first version entirely in PUB. Don Knuth developed TeX for authors of
                  mathematical texts. Meanwhile, SGML and C took over as the basis for most future
                  markup and scripting languages, and PUB became a forgotten milestone in digital
                  publishing history.</p>

                        <p>Martin Frost for creating the first network news service. Martin Frost, with
                  input from John McCarthy and Les Earnest, created two successive news services
                  that each was the first of its kind. Beginning in 1972, APE could be used either
                  to connect to the Associated Press newswire or to search recent stories based on
                  combinations of pre-selected keywords. Beginning in 1974 NS (for News Service)
                  indexed and stored stories from both the Associated Press and New York Times news
                  wires and allowed users to either search for recent stories using any combination
                  or words or leave a standing request to be notified whenever a story appears that
                  contains the specified words. NS was widely used by people on ARPAnet for general
                  news information.</p>
                        <p>During the Three Mile Island nuclear incident in 1979 the emergency response team
                  at Lawrence Livermore Lab found that they needed up-to-the-minute information on
                  developments at the site but couldn't get it until they were provided with access
                  to NS. During the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, Chinese students in the U.S.
                  wanted to pass information to friends in China but there were no Internet
                  connections there then. NS was then set up to locate news about China and forward
                  it to a student distribution list so that they could print the stories and fax
                  them home. Commercial news services were developed later that now provide similar
                  functionality to anyone who wants it and is willing to pay a subscription fee.</p>

                        <p>Phil Petit for initiating the first interactive electronic design system, SUDS.
                  Phil Petit initiated the development of the Stanford University Drawing System
                  (SUDS), which was the first graphical computer aided design system used for the
                  design of a real computer. It allowed designers to do both logic drawings and
                  physical layouts on printed circuit cards and cross-check them for consistency.
                  When the design was complete it produced artwork for printed circuit cards and
                  backpanel wiring instructions that would control an automatic wiring machine. Dick
                  Helliwell subsequently took over further development and maintenance of SUDS and
                  went with it to the Digital Equipment Corporation, where it was used as their
                  primary design tool for at least a decade. It was also used by Information
                  International Incorporated (III), Foonly Inc., Valid Logic, and Cisco Systems.
                  SAIL user Andy Bechtolsheim used it to design both the original SUN (Stanford
                  University Network) workstations and all of those manufactured by Sun Microsystems
                  for a number of years.</p>

                        <p>Steve Russell for creating SPACEWAR, the first videogame. There were several
                  early board games that ran on digital computers, such as Tic Tack Toe, and "Tennis
                  for Two" ran on an analog computer. However the first dynamic videogame was
                  Spacewar!, as reviewed at <extref actuate="onrequest"
                                   show="new"
                                   href="http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/computingthen/2009/03/CT-Lowood.pdf">http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/computingthen/2009/03/CT-Lowood.pdf</extref>.
                  It was originally developed for the DEC PDP-I computer at MIT by Steve Russell and
                  his colleagues in the Tech Model Railroad Club. Spacewar! spread through PDP-I
                  installations, and many others who had different computer and a display wrote
                  versions for the equipment at hand. Steve then brought it to Stanford when he
                  moved here to join John McCarthy and he and others then improved it. Meanwhile a
                  company called Atari was formed to convert Spacewar into a commercial videogame
                  called "Computer Space" using TTL electronics and no programmable computer.
                  However Bill Pitts of SAIL beat them to it using a PDP-II computer to create
                  "Galaxy Game" and put it into the Stanford coffee shop and a local bowling alley.
                  While the Galaxy Game was quite popular, Atari observed that their version of
                  Spacewar was expensive to reproduce and somewhat hard for people to learn, so they
                  instead introduced the game of Pong which was cheap to make, easy to understand,
                  and a great commercial success. This allowed Atari to thrive for a time.</p>

                  Quam and his colleagues developed an image indexing scheme for planetary
                  exploration and picture differencing techniques to facilitate identification of
                  things that changed over time. This was used by Carl Sagan and other astronomers
                  who visited SAIL every few weeks to evaluate satellite photographs of Mars. Quam
                  successfully solved the problem of detecting small changes in the planet surface
                  in the presence of several extraneous factors. His system was subsequently applied
                  to pictures of Mars taken by the Mariner 9 spacecraft while the mission was in
                  progress.</p>
