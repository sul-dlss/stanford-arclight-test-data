         <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
         <p>The Stanford Historical Society's Oral History Program explores the institutional history
        of the University, with an emphasis on the transformative post-WWII period, through
        interviews with leading faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and others. The project furthers
        the Society's mission "to foster and support the documentation, study, publication, and
        preservation of the history of the Leland Stanford Junior University."</p>
         <p>Like any primary source material, oral history is not intended to present the final,
        verified, or complete narrative of events. It is a unique, reflective, spoken account,
        offered by the interviewee in response to questioning, and as such it may be deeply
        personal. By capturing the flavor of incidents, events, and personalities, the oral history
        approach provides details and viewpoints that are not often found in traditional
        records.</p>
         <p>Transcripts in this collection are lightly edited by program staff and by Interviewees to
        correct grammar and occasional inaccuracies. Audio, however, is not edited. As a result,
        transcripts do not match recordings verbatim.</p>

               <p>Includes a videocassette and audiocassette of the alumni reunion session held on Oct.
            14, 1999; audio recordings and transcripts of interviews with alumni from the class of
            1957 done during the class reunions held on campus during the fall quarter, 2007; and
            audio recordings and transcripts of the Alumni Stories project.</p>
               <p>The Alumni Stories project was piloted during Reunion Homecoming Weekend in October
            2007, and was repeated in October 2008. Over 60 alumni, most attending their 50th
            reunions, recounted their memories and stories about undergraduate student life in the
            1950s. An additional 15 alumni were interviewed at a Founding Grant Society event in
            2009.</p>

                  <p>The interview with Dr. Mary Murray-Griffin-Jones covered several topics and even
              included a few photos from her experience of Stanford University. She explained her
              family’s long-time connection to the university, including a photograph of her
              grandfather Augustus Taber Murray, who was an early faculty member of the Classics
              Department. Dr. Murray-Griffin-Jones told stories about her time as an undergraduate
              and a medical student at Stanford, describing some of her classmates, classes, and
              social activities. Finally, she reflected on her participation in the Stanford
              community after graduation, especially in the Stanford Founding Grant Society.</p>

                  <p>Martha Nordling Eakland was a member of the Class of '41. In spite of her wish to
              attend UCLA with her friends, the head of the English department at Los Angeles High
              School and her father got her to Stanford. What followed was a wonderful education
              enriched by friendships, sports, memorable professors and escapades. She was the
              president of Women's Council, and she played in Stanford’s first intramural women’s
              basketball game against University of California-Berkeley.</p>

                  <p>Thorn Smith is a retired fisheries and endangered species attorney. On his graduation
              from Stanford, he started a diving company in Morro Bay, California and spent about 10
              years as a commercial diver. He developed an interest in marine affairs and then
              marine biology and so he went to law school. He was hired to be a Fisheries attorney
              for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, DC. Eventually,
              he became involved in the very early implementation of the Magnuson Fishery
              Conservation and Management Act of 1976. It was the beginning of a huge period of
              development in marine science, technology and commercial fisheries.</p>
                  <p>After five years as a federal fishery manager and attorney, he moved to Seattle which
              was the hub of American fisheries, offshore fisheries, and represented different
              groups for the rest of my career. Thorn Smith served on a couple of committees where
              he worked on issues related to international fisheries and endangered species. He also
              spent a lot of time lobbying on Capitol Hill relating to fisheries.</p>

                  <p>In 1961, Thorn Smith was one of three delegates sent by Stanford's Beta Chi chapter
              to Sigma Nu national fraternity's annual convention. The delegation was charged with
              trying to get the convention to vote to repeal a clause in the national fraternity's
              1868 charter, which forbade membership to people of African descent. Smith and his
              fellow petitioners were not given a hearing and felt it was clear they were recognized
              when they asked to speak because the national fraternity had no wish to open
              discussion of the matter. In November, 1962, the Stanford chapter seceded from the
              national fraternity in protest of its policy of racial exclusion. Smith recalls his
              experience leading up to the national convention, being responded to with intense
              anger at the convention, and the subsequent act of secession. The interview provides
              insight into the early development of political activism on the Stanford campus in the
              1960s.</p>

                  <p>In 1959, a year after one member ran over and killed another in the driveway on Big
              Game Bonfire night, the Beta Chi (Stanford) chapter of Sigma Nu national fraternity
              was near collapse. A number of freshmen got together in 1960 and pledged the
              fraternity as a group. They aimed at a diverse pledge class, comprised of as many of
              the leaders of the class of 1963 as they could attract. It proved to be an unusual
              fraternity, boasting among its 1963 graduates two Rhodes Scholars, two Wilsons, two
              Danforths. Along the way, in November, 1962, the chapter seceded from the national
              fraternity in protest of its policy of racial exclusion. Marshall Turner describes the
              assembling of the pledge class and the events that led to its departure from the
              national. The interview provides insight into the early development of political
              activism on the Stanford campus in the 1960s.</p>

                  <p>Marshall C. Turner is a former CEO or interim CEO of four technology companies and
              one broadcasting station. His technology industry experience also includes twenty
              years as a venture capital fund principal, and an early career as an industrial
              designer and biomedical engineer. Public and community service has been an important
              aspect of his life. He has chaired the boards of two national organizations – the
              Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, and the Corporation for Public
              Broadcasting -- as well as his local school board and public broadcasting station. He
              has served as a board member of thirty-four organizations -- including twenty-two
              public or private companies in software, electronics, biotechnology, computer,
              telecommunication, consumer product, and education markets. </p>
                  <p>He is currently a member of three public-company and three non-profit boards of
              directors: Alliance Bernstein Funds, New York (mutual fund family); MEMC Electronic
              Materials, Inc., St. Peters, Missouri (semiconductor and solar substrates, solar power
              plants); Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, California (programmable logic semiconductors);
              American Alliance of Museums, Washington DC; George Lucas Educational Foundation,
              Nicasio, California; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC.
              During his early career, he gained product design experience at Mattel and General
              Motors, and then served at the National Institutes of Health as a Commissioned Officer
              in the U.S. Public Health Service. While a biomedical engineer at NIH, he and a heart
              surgeon colleague designed an implantable left ventricular heart assist pump, and
              co-led the team that tested the device through twenty-nine calf implant surgeries, and
              published several papers on their work.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Turner was selected one of 17 White House Fellows in 1970, as he completed his
              MBA. After his fellowship year as a Special Assistant to Elliot Richardson, then
              Secretary of Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, he remained in Washington
              as part of the start-up leadership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
              heading a coordinative staff of MBAs and attorneys reporting to the first
              Administrator and Deputy Administrator.</p>
                  <p>He returned to California in 1973 to begin learning the venture capital business as
              the associate in a private venture capital firm. Since then, he has been an active
              technology venture investor based in San Francisco, who often has taken an active
              leadership role in investments. After co-founding Taylor &amp; Turner Associates, Ltd.
              in 1981, Mr. Turner was a General Partner managing three related institutional venture
              capital partnerships through the last one’s completion in 1998. Investments of the
              firm, and the focus of his subsequent active investing, have been seed and early stage
              technology-related companies -- usually at their inception.</p>
                  <p>His first CEO role was for a small, multinational liquid crystal company that he
              joined as chairman and CEO at the request of its venture investors, shortly after it
              filed under Chapter Eleven in 1975. The company was successfully reorganized within a
              year, then over the next three years grew internationally in medical and consumer
              markets.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Turner served as Chief Executive Officer of Dupont Photomasks, Inc., [symbol
              DPMI] Austin, Texas, for three years (2003-2006), and chairman while it was a public
              company. He had also served as a member of the board of directors since the company’s
              IPO in 1996, and as interim chairman and CEO for eleven months (1999-2000). Photomasks
              are a key custom component for the fabrication of semiconductor chips. DPI operated
              through a tightly coupled global network of ten manufacturing sites in Germany,
              France, China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. Turner was appointed
              chairman and CEO in June, 2003, following erosion of the company’s operating and
              financial performance. Operating metrics and financial results strongly improved
              during his tenure. Then as the company successfully completed a restructuring of its
              manufacturing network and research laboratories, he led negotiations that resulted in
              the Company’s acquisition by Toppan Printing Company, Ltd. for $650 million in
              2005.</p>
                  <p>In 2008-2009, he served as interim CEO of MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc. [symbol
              WFR], a global manufacturer of silicon wafers for customers in semiconductor and solar
              power markets with 2008 revenues of $2 billion.</p>
                  <p>His public service leadership experience includes membership on the following boards:
              Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (1997-2006, 2012 to present, chair
              2002- 2006 ), the Public Broadcasting Service (1993¬1999, vice-chair 1996-1999); the
              Corporation for Public Broadcasting (1987-1992, chair 1990-1992); KQED, Inc. in San
              Francisco (1977- 1983, 1985-1988, chair 1985-1987, interim CEO 1993); and election to
              the board of trustees of his local school board in California in 1977, which he
              chaired through major reforms in 1979-1981.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Turner received a B.S. Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University
              in 1964, and an M.S. Degree in Product Design, a joint program of Stanford's Art and
              Engineering Departments, in 1965. He was president of his senior class (1963). In
              1970, he received an M.B.A. with distinction from Harvard Business School, and
              received the J. Leslie Rollins Award. </p>
                  <p>Mr. Turner is married to Ann Curran Turner, an artist and teacher. They have three
              adult children.</p>

                  <p>Matt Kahn arrived at Stanford in 1949 at the age of 21. He had been studying at the
              Cranbrook Academy of Art when then Art and Architecture Department Chair Ray Faulker
              wrote to Cranbrook for recommendations of someone to teach design as part of
              Stanford's art curriculum. He has taught at Stanford ever since. Kahn was appointed an
              assistant professor in 1953, a full professor in 1965, and, in the mid-1960's, along
              with mechanical engineering Prof. Bob McKim, founded the Joint Program in Design
              (JPD), with the plan of marrying curricula in design, fine arts and engineering.</p>
               </bioghist>
               <scopecontent id="aspace_e66a1bed57ba48df82c56a0a640942c1">
                  <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                  <p>"Constructive disobedience" and "fantasy and soul" are two of Professor Kahn's
              signature design philosophies and he shares how these approaches have framed his
              teaching, his personal art-making and many of his class assignments. From his setting
              up complicated still life scenes for his drawing classes, to his later 'Cyclops'
              lectures and Art 60 pumpkin carving projects, he shares memories of student reactions,
              interactions and design experiences.</p>
                  <p>Kahn describes how his presence as a designer and artist has been somewhat of an
              enigma to other art faculty throughout his career and notes how the early days of
              launching the undergraduate courses and the graduate JPD curriculum has been a gradual
              merging of engineering and art/design cultures and political/personal perspectives. He
              briefly remembers the time when he decided not to return to formal collegiate study to
              obtain a degree.</p>
                  <p>Professor Kahn is proud of the professional successes of his former students, among
              them David Kelley, IDEO founder and former JPD teacher, and Michael Duncan, Director
              at San Francisco architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Matt talks about
              Stanford campus – the Quad, in particular – and the many relationships he has
              developed and maintained with his students and acknowledges how much he learns from
              and appreciates their presence in his personal and professional lives.</p>
                  <p>In this interview, Kahn also remembers his years as a design consultant with Eichler
              Homes and how his year in Cambodia for the US State Department influenced his own
              product designs and his design aesthetic.</p>

              sports careers and recruitments to Stanford Football. Their experiences encompassed

              discussed their coaches John Ralston and Jack Christiansen, records and statistics,
              favorite memories of games and teammates, and also some more difficult memories of
              losses. Finally, the interview looked briefly at Shockley and Brown’s memories of

              student at Stanford during the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>

              and Stanford Football and Baseball career from 1989-1992. The conversation included

              Lynch’s decision to switch football positions. From there Lynch talked about how he
              nearly quit football but Bill Walsh convinced him that he could be a Pro Bowl safety
              in the NFL, leading to a pro football career in the NFL. Lynch also looked at specific
              memories of his favorite football and baseball moments, his social life on Stanford
              campus, and his friends and teammates. Finally, Lynch spoke about his post-Stanford

                  <p>In his interview, David Abernethy discussed the changes in diversity on Stanford
              campus between the late 1960s and the late 1980s. He explained his role in the events
              of that time, including “Taking the Mic.” The interview also encompassed Abernethy’s
              take on the broader context of social change in the United States during that time,
              the interrelationship of issues of racial equality and protests against the Vietnam
              War, and the effects of the upheaval on faculty and teaching. Abernethy explored the
              development of the African and African-American Studies Program and student-led
              courses on political and social issues (SWOPSI).</p>

                  <p>David B. Abernethy joined Stanford University’s Department of Political Science in
              1965 and became Professor Emeritus at the start of 2003. He received a B.A. in
              Government from Harvard College in 1959 (magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa), an M.A. in
              Philosophy-Politics-Economics from Oxford (1961), and a Ph.D. in Government from
              Harvard (1966) on a Danforth Foundation Graduate Fellowship.</p>
                  <p>A specialist in sub-Saharan Africa, Prof. Abernethy regularly taught courses on
              politics in tropical Africa and southern Africa. His more general interest in
              relations between currently developing world regions and currently wealthy, powerful
              countries was reflected in courses on "Controversies over Foreign Aid," "International
              Dependency," "Colonialism and Nationalism in the Third World," "The World and the
              West," and "Decolonization in Asia and Africa, 1945-80." He is author of The Political
              Dilemma of Popular Education: An African Case (Stanford, 1969) and The Dynamics of
              Global Dominance: European Overseas Empires, 1415-1980 (Yale, 2000).</p>
                  <p>Prof. Abernethy received two Dean's Awards for distinguished teaching, a School of
              Humanities and Sciences Award for lifetime achievements in teaching, the Stanford
              Alumni Association's Richard W. Lyman Award for contributions to alumni, and the
              University's Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for contributions to undergraduate
              education.</p>
                  <p>Prof. Abernethy's University service includes serving as Chair of the Faculty Senate,
              two terms as Chair of the African Studies Committee, two terms co-chairing the
              International Relations Program, and a term as President of the Stanford chapter of
              Phi Beta Kappa. In retirement he has occasionally taught a lecture course on "NGOs and
              Development in Poor Countries." He also set up a no-credit, no-grades International
              Development Careers Discussion Group, where undergraduates interested in international
              development meet to talk about their own career aspirations and to hear from others
              who have devised creative careers in this field.</p>
                  <p>Abernethy has chaired the Stanford Emeriti Council since 2005, and helped set up a
              public lecture series for the several hundred faculty and staff emeriti and their
              spouses who live on campus and in neighboring communities. He has also greatly enjoyed
              working with the Stanford Alumni Association’s Travel/Study program for over two
              decades. He has been faculty lecturer on twelve trips to sub-Saharan and North Africa,
              South Asia, the Indian Ocean, and New Zealand. The most recent, in January, was an
              around-the-world trip by jet roughly tracing the course of the HMS Beagle, the ship on
              which Charles Darwin sailed for five years in the 1830s. Recently, Abernethy completed
              a 5-year term on the Board of Trustees of The Hill School, a private secondary
              boarding school in Pottstown, Pa. which I attended for three years.</p>
                  <p>He is married to Susan Getman Abernethy and they have two sons, Bruce and Brad, and
              four grandchildren.</p>

              American graduate of the Stanford University Law School and the first member of his

              Ames served as the first Hopi Chief Judge of the Tribal Court on his reservation for
              almost twenty years. He is well known for his continuous involvement in Native
              American educational and cultural affairs as well as local Monterey County and
              Stanford endeavors. A short-term participant in the Indian Occupation of Alcatraz
              Island regarded as a major turning point in Indian political power, he has remained
              active in the Stanford American Indian and Alumni Association programs. In 1992, by
              presidential appointment and full U.S. Senate confirmation, he was sworn in by Justice
              Sandra Day O’Connor to membership and eventual chairmanship of the National Board of
              Trustees of the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts
              Development (IAIA), a college and museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
                  <p>At Stanford, Ames was a member of the freshman and varsity baseball squads. Recently
              he served as a member of the Stanford Athletic Board and the Stanford Alumni
              Association Board of Directors. He began his alumni volunteer service with the
              athletic department as a volunteer and area chairman of the Buck/Cardinal Club's
              personal solicitation program. He then went on to serve as a member of the Athletic
              Board. Ames has been active in numerous reunion efforts for the class of '51 and has
              worked passionately and tirelessly on every board and in every capacity he has served.
              He was a member of the Stanford Alumni Association's Board of Directors and Stanford
              Associates Board of Governors. An ardent supporter of Stanford's Native American
              Cultural Center, and a mentor for its students, Ames was honored by the center in 2004
              when he was inducted into the Multicultural Hall of Fame. Stanford Law School
              publications have recognized him as a trailblazer for American Indian students at the
              school. Ames continues his commitment to educate the public and preserve Indian arts
              and culture by serving as an advisory board member of the Arizona State Museum at the
              University of Arizona and a trustee of the Heard Museum in Phoenix, each a nationally
              recognized southwest museum and research center with emphasis on Native Americans.</p>
                  <p>In 2011, Ames was awarded the Stanford Medal for more than 50 years of continuous
              outstanding and significant services to Stanford University. </p>

                  <p>Ms. Cecilia Burciaga was interviewed as part of the Stanford Historical Society Oral
              History Project on racial and ethnical diversity at Stanford University from the late
              ‘60s through the 1980s. Over the course of the conversation, Burciaga spoke about the
              clash between individual and communal success, the victories and difficulties of
              minorities on university campuses, and Affirmative Action. She discussed her views on
              international diversity vs. domestic diversity, and her experiences of the
              Inter-Agency Committee on Mexican American Affairs. Ms. Burciaga also explained her
              role in the Office of Chicano Affairs and the ethnic community centers and dorms on
              Stanford campus in general. The interview also included Burciaga’s take on the Women’s
              Rights Movement and the University Committee on Minority Issues Report.</p>

                  <p>Cecilia Preciado Burciaga was born in Pomona and her education included a BA in
              Spanish, English, and Linguistics from CSU Fullerton and later a secondary teaching
              credential. In 1972 she got a master’s in Policy Studies in Education from UC
              Riverside. Her early career included social science research for the US Civil Rights
              Commission in Washington, D.C. Cecilia Burciaga arrived at Stanford in 1974 to become
              assistant to the president and provost for Chicano affairs during the administration
              of the late President Richard W. Lyman. For ten years, she and her husband, Jose
              Antonio “Tony” Burciaga, were the resident fellows for Casa Zapata, the Chicano-theme
              dorm in Stern Hall.</p>
                  <p>In twenty years at Stanford, Cecilia Burciaga held many positions including Associate
              Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, Dean of Summer Session, and Assistant Provost
              for Faculty Affairs. When her position as Associate Dean and Development Officer for
              Student Resources was eliminated due to budget cuts in 1994, protests from all parts
              of the university community followed.</p>
                  <p>After leaving Stanford, Burciaga became a founding dean of CSU Monterey Bay, working
              in the Office of the President and later as Associate Vice President of Student
              Affairs. She also served on the national level, advocating for Hispanic-Americans and
              women.</p>
                  <p>Burciaga died at 67 years old in March 2013 after a battle with lung cancer. She is
              remembered as an important voice on campus for the Latino population of students and
              parents. She worked with immigrant parents who felt anxious about sending their
              children to university, and she helped get the ethnic theme dorms and community
              centers established for many ethnic minorities in the campus community. Burciaga also
              pushed for more minority and female admissions in undergraduate and graduate programs,
              as well as appointments for faculty positions. Cecilia Preciado Burciaga is remembered
              as someone who would take up causes to fight injustice, and admired as a “person of
              leadership in the Latino community long before it became fashionable.”</p>

                  <p>A member of Stanford’s department of history since receiving his doctorate from UCLA
              in 1975, Clayborne Carson has also served as visiting professor or visiting fellow at
              American University, the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University, Emory
              University, Harvard University, the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral
              Sciences at Stanford, the L’Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, and
              at Morehouse College in Atlanta, where during 2009 he was Martin Luther King, Jr.
              Distinguished Professor and Executive Director of that institution's King
              Collection.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Carson’s extensive writings reflect not only his research about King but also his
              undergraduate civil rights and antiwar activism, which led him to appreciate the
              importance of grassroots political activity as well as visionary leadership in the
              African-American freedom struggle. His latest book, Martin's Dream: My Journey and the
              Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., is a memoir tracing his life from teenage
              participant in the 1963 March on Washington to internationally-known King scholar.
              Carson’s first book, In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s, published
              in 1981, remains the definitive history of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
              Committee, the most dynamic and innovative civil rights organization. In Struggle won
              the Organization of American Historians’ Frederick Jackson Turner Award. His other
              publications include Malcolm X: The FBI File (1991). Carson also co-authored African
              American Lives: The Struggle for Freedom (2005), a comprehensive survey of
              African-American history.</p>
                  <p>In addition to The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr., Carson’s other works based on
              the papers include <title render="italic">The Autobiography of Martin Luther King,
                Jr.</title> (1998), compiled from the King’s autobiographical writings, <title render="italic">A Knock at Midnight: Inspiration from the Great Sermons of Reverend
                Martin Luther King, Jr.</title> (1998), and <title render="italic">A Call to
                Conscience: The Landmark Speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</title> (2001).</p>
                  <p>Dr. Carson wrote “Passages of Martin Luther King,” a play that was initially produced
              by Stanford’s Drama Department in 1993 and subsequently performed at Dartmouth
              College, Willamette University, the Claremont Colleges, the University of Washington,
              Tacoma, and other places. On June 21, 2007, the National Theatre of China performed
              the international premiere of “Passages” at the Beijing Oriental Pioneer Theatre, and
              full houses viewed the four subsequent performances of the first drama to bring
              together Chinese actors and African-American gospel singers. During March and April
              2011, the Palestinian National Theater “Al Hakawati” presented the first Arabic
              production of “Passages” in East Jerusalem, with additional performances in the West

                  <p>In addition to his books and scholarly writings, Dr. Carson has devoted considerable
              attention to bringing his research and King’s ideas to broader public attention. Dr.
              Carson was a senior historical advisor for a fourteen-part, award-winning, public
              television series on the civil rights movement entitled “Eyes on the Prize” and
              co-edited the Eyes on the Prize Civil Rights Reader (1991). In addition, he served as
              historical advisor for “Freedom on My Mind,” which was nominated for an Oscar in 1995,
              as well as for “Chicano!” (1996), “Blacks and Jews” (1997), “Citizen King” (2004),
              “Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power” (2005), “Have You Heard from
              Johannesburg?” (2010) a multipart documentary about the international campaign against
              apartheid in South Africa, and “Al Helm: Martin Luther King in Palestine’ (2013). The
              Liberation Curriculum initiative that Dr. Carson conceived has become a major source
              of educational materials about King and the ongoing struggles to achieve peace with
              social justice, and the King Institute’s enormously popular website --
              kinginstitute.info -- reaches a diverse, global audience.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Carson also collaborated with the Roma Design Group of San Francisco to create
              the winning proposal in an international competition to design the King National
              Memorial in Washington, D. C., and he has served as an advisor to the King National
              Memorial Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Among the many honors and awards Dr. Carson has received, the honorary degree he
              received in 2007 from Morehouse College had special meaning because it made him part
              of the community of Morehouse Men that includes Martin Luther King, Jr. and Sr.</p>

                  <p>After graduating from Bryn Mawr College, Alice Supton Chanowitz moved to New York.
              She taught first grade and went to City College for a Master’s Degree in Education.
              When she came to Stanford in 1973, she spent half time as secretary to the Committee
              on Undergraduate Studies and half as support for the Urban Studies Program. During the
              next two years Chanowitz worked as director of SCIRE (Student Center for Innovation
              and Research in Education) helping students design independent projects under faculty
              sponsorship, and co-director of SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
              Issues). She moved to Residential Education in 1976 and over the years was promoted to
              Associate Dean. A highlight of Chanowitz’s life was receiving the Dinkelspiel Award
              for service to undergraduate education. When her first son came along, she shifted to
              half-time and shared the Res Ed responsibilities. When her second son was on the way
              in 1993, she realized that it was time to relinquish the job.</p>

                  <p>Henry Der was an undergraduate from ’64 to’68, before much of the campus ferment
              around diversity began. His story presents a sharp and illuminating contrast to those
              who came to Stanford in 1968 and later. As an undergraduate, he reported feeling
              alienated from Stanford, as much for socioeconomic as racial reasons and for a time
              lived off-campus. In the 1980s, he served on the Advisory Board to the Haas Public
              Service Center; and in the late 1980s he was a member of a team, led by President
              Norman Francis of Xavier University, that reviewed the University’s responses to the
              recommendations of the University Committee on Minority Issues and to its self-study
              of performance under its Institutional Standards on Cultural Diversity. (The report of
              this team was issued in April 1990.) After graduating, Der served in the Peace Corps
              and was Executive Director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. These highly involving
              activities made his connection with Stanford quite tangential after 1968, and his
              recollections of his post-1968 relationships with the University are faint.</p>

                  <p>Henry Der is currently the Senior Program Officer with the Four Freedoms Fund. At
              Four Freedoms Fund, a national funders’ collaborative, Henry Der strategizes with
              national and state-level immigrant rights groups to secure immigration reform and
              defend immigrant rights. For more than 22 years, he served as Executive Director of
              the San Francisco-based Chinese for Affirmative Action, advocating for fairness and
              equal opportunities in employment, education, voting and access to publicly-supported
              services for Chinese Americans and other racial minorities. At the California
              Department of Education, he was the Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction with
              oversight responsibilities for programs that serve at-risk and special needs students.
              He also served as State Administrator of Emery Unified School District, successfully
              bringing it out of fiscal bankruptcy. Additionally he has served as the chairperson of
              the California Postsecondary Education Commission and the State Bar Legal Services
              Trust Fund Commission. Between 1991 and 2001, he was a commentator for the NPR
              affiliate KQED-FM, probing issues of race, ethnicity, fairness and accountability in
              public services.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history interview, Joseph Thomas Flies-Away (formerly Joseph William
              Thomas, Jr.) describes his undergraduate days at Stanford with a focus on his work
              within the Native American community and in Student Affairs. Flies-Away offers
              insights into Native American student life at Stanford during the 1980s, describing
              incidents of Native American student activism and detailing his efforts to build
              bridges within and beyond the Stanford community and to educate the community about
              Native culture. He expresses his frustration at the lack of Native American and ethnic
              studies offerings in the curriculum and the dearth of Native American professors.
              Throughout the interview he reads portions of documents that he has collected related
              to Native American affairs at Stanford and excerpts from his own poetry and
              writings.</p>

                  <p>Dan Kojiro graduated from high school in East Los Angeles and attended Stanford for
              undergraduate studies. He was in the Class of 1974. Although he was not politically
              active before arriving at Stanford, he eventually became involved in campus student
              activism, partly because of the political climate of the time and the circumstances at
              Stanford. He was a co-founder of the Okada theme dorm and helped organize outreach
              activities in high school to promote Asian American students’ awareness of Stanford
              and to encourage their application for admission to Stanford. While active in student
              affairs, Dan Kojiro was also an on-air programmer at the campus radio station,

                  <p>Luis G. Nogales relates his experience as a student and then a senior staff member at
              Stanford University from 1966 to 1972 when the university began to embrace racial and
              ethnic diversity. He begins by sharing his experiences growing up in a Mexican
              American family in San Joaquin Valley, California, and his experiences at San Diego
              State University. He then talks about how those experiences shaped him prior to coming
              to Stanford.</p>
                  <p>He continues with his decision to attend Stanford Law School and the opportunities
              that afforded him to help recruit Mexican American students. While in law school,
              Nogales was active in various ways to recruit and bring together Mexican American
              students. After law school, he served as an Assistant to the President of Stanford
              University for Mexican American Affairs. He talks about his work with MASC (Mexican
              American Student Confederation) and MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán).
              He also describes his relationships with other organizations and other ethnic groups,
              particularly with African American student groups, not only at Stanford, but at other
              universities and colleges. He also mentions issues concerning worker’s rights and race
              relations within the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church at that time. Finally, he
              describes the differences between the early days of affirmative action and diversity
              at Stanford from how it is in more recent years.</p>
                  <p>After leaving Stanford in 1972, Nogales continued to be involved with the university
              in various roles, including serving on the Board of Visitors of the Law School and the
              Board of Visitors of the Libraries. He was the Founding Chair of the Stanford Center
              for Public Service and a member of the Board of Trustees. In addition to these
              experiences, he talks about a recent class action lawsuit against Texaco and how
              things changed in the country over time regarding diversity and affirmative
              action.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Over a period of 30 years, Luis G. Nogales has built a broad and successful record as
              a senior operating executive and as a private equity fund manager. Moreover, he has
              enhanced his business acumen and network by serving on the boards of directors of
              public and private companies. He has served on the investment committees of the board
              of directors of non-profit institutions with investment portfolios in excess of $75
              billion, which include the Ford Foundation, J. Paul Getty Trust, and Stanford
              University. In addition, Nogales has strong ties to the Hispanic community within the
              United States and Mexico. Already, his knowledge of and relationships within these
              population segments have led to significant deal flow for companies with products and
              services directed to Hispanic consumers, which is the fastest growing population group
              and purchasing power consumer segment in the country. A summary of the private equity
              investments in which Nogales has served as the principal investment professional can
              be found in Section 7 (“Discussion of Past Investments”) of this Memorandum.</p>
                  <p>In 1969, Luis G. Nogales started his professional career after graduating from the
              Stanford Law School where he worked as Special Assistant to the President of Stanford
              University until 1972. In 1972, Nogales was selected as a White House Fellow and
              served as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior. This experience provided
              the opportunity to work on policy formation and implementation at the most senior
              levels of federal government. After completing his White House Fellowship, Luis
              Nogales began his private sector career. He has negotiated business and personnel
              contracts, labor, acquisition and sale agreements, and has worked with local, state
              and federal government regulators. As president and CEO of Univision, United Press
              International and Embarcadero Media, Nogales exercised superior leadership in guiding
              these companies through a variety of economic and life cycle stages (start up, growth,
              and turn around). During his tenure at these companies, he recruited and built
              management teams, and changed work forces to address company requirements. In
              particular, he successfully planned and implemented programs to increase sales and to
              reduce costs.</p>
                  <p>At Univision, the preeminent U.S. Spanish-language television network, Luis G.
              Nogales led the company’s growth in revenues by over 20% per year for a two-year
              period, while positioning the company for a successful sale by rationalizing costs and
              mitigating regulatory issues. At United Press International, which operated in over 60
              countries with over 2,000 employees, Nogales led a turnaround that resulted in the
              company’s first profit in over 20 years. He reorganized the company and executed a
              successful sale.</p>
                  <p>In the private equity arena, as one of the partners in the Lombard/Nogales Radio
              Fund, Nogales successfully raised, invested and exited approximately $25.6 million in
              equity investments, generating a gross IRR of approximately 30% to his institutional
              investors. The fund acquired radio stations under a holding company, Embarcadero
              Media. Nogales led the acquisition and management of eight radio stations in four
              separate transactions and participated in the planning and execution of the exit from
              these properties over a 3½-year period. Of the eight radio stations, he started six
              new radio operations by reformatting the programming to Spanish language and
              rebuilding the sales force to address a different market segment. The remaining two
              stations were maintained in the same format, English language.</p>
                  <p>After selling all the assets of Embarcadero Media, Nogales worked as senior advisor
              to the Deutsche Bank Private Equity Latin America Group. Among his activities there,
              he led the acquisition of four outdoor media companies in Brazil to form Brazil Midia
              Exterior (“BME”) at a price of US$72 million. Although the investment was made during
              a period of decline in the Brazilian economy, the consolidation made BME the largest
              outdoor advertising company in the country in a fragmented industry and thus a
              strategic and valuable company. Since BME’s acquisitions, Clear Channel, a U.S.-based
              media company, has acquired two outdoor media companies in Brazil, confirming BME’s
              thesis that the Brazil outdoor media market would be attractive to international
              strategic companies if consolidated. BME is the largest outdoor company in Brazil with
              strategic assets, making it an attractive acquisition target. Moreover, a media
              experienced senior management team was brought in to position the company for further
              growth and consolidation. In addition to the transactional work in Brazil, Nogales
              participated in facilitating and helping to negotiate a successful exit from an
              investment in Mexico, Jugos del Valle, a juice production and distribution
              company.</p>
                  <p>For the past 7 years, Luis G. Nogales has served as the Managing Partner of Nogales
              Investors Management, LLC, the manager of two private equity funds with $345 million
              of assets under management. Nogales also has invaluable experience serving on the
              boards of directors of public and private companies. He has chaired committees in
              audit, finance, personnel and compensation. During the course of his lengthy tenure on
              corporate boards, Nogales has provided oversight and advice to senior management
              through economic cycles and company growth stages. Through his operating and board
              experience, Nogales developed a working knowledge and expertise in the following
              industry sectors: energy, home building, consumer products, banking, retail, apparel,
              and media. He is currently on the board of Edison International, KB Home, and
              Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His previous board experience includes Arbitron Inc., The
              J. Paul Getty Trust, the National Association of Investment Companies, Coors, Levi
              Strauss, Lucky Stores, Bank of California, Kaufman &amp; Broad S.A, the Ford
              Foundation, Stanford University and the Mayo Clinic Trust.</p>
                  <p>Luis G. Nogales’ strong and influential networks in the business, community and
              public sectors, formed by years of participation and relationship building, is
              expected to contribute significantly to the success of the Partnership. Luis G.
              Nogales graduated from San Diego State University and the Stanford University Law
              School. He speaks fluent Spanish.</p>

                  <p>This interview with Professor Jerry I. Porras is part of the Oral History Project on
              Racial and Ethnic Diversity. Professor Porras discussed what happened in Stanford's
              history to initiate and then to shape the increase in diversity at the university from
              the 1960s to the present. He began by recounting his youth in El Paso and continued by
              describing the scholastic and professional trajectory that led him to Stanford. Porras
              discussed both the admirable and less-than-admirable aspects of the University’s
              record of diversity outreach. Most of the conversation about diversity issues focused
              on people -- undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty -- of Chicano and
              Latino descent. One idea that emerges is that the character of diversity outreach at
              Stanford has evolved over time. This interview offers an enlightening window on that
              evolution.</p>

                  <p>Willard Wyman was interviewed as part of the Stanford Historical Society Oral History
              Project on Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the late 1960s through the 1980s. He was
              Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Activities, advisor to the Black Student Union,
              and served on the Committee of Fifteen. Wyman was also special assistant to President
              Kenneth Pitzer and worked closely with Provost Richard Lyman during that time. His
              interview focused on the Tresidder Union 1968 “Taking the Mic” incident where black
              students took over the mic from Lyman during a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. and
              presented ten demands to the university administration.</p>
                  <p>Wyman commented that Stanford was ahead of the curve on ethnic diversity and gave

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Herbert Abrams was an emeritus professor of radiology at the Stanford University
              School of Medicine, a senior research fellow at Stanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute
              for International Studies, and a prolific author of books and scholarly articles. He
              contributed greatly to the Stanford community through his interests in diagnostic
              radiology and nuclear weapons. In this three-part interview, Abrams discussed his
              youth in New York, his residency and teaching experience at Stanford’s medical school,
              and how his interest shifted from radiology to nuclear weapons research and
              activism.</p>
                  <p>Abrams described his childhood in Brooklyn, centering his discussion on his family
              and his high school years. His family’s love of language seemingly influenced Abrams
              to pursue an English major and to work for a variety of newspapers and journals at
              Cornell University, ultimately taking a job after graduation as a newsreel media
              analyst for the government. Although his interest in Freudian literature prompted
              Abrams to apply to medical school, once enrolled at SUNY Downstate College of
              Medicine, he quickly redirected his efforts from psychiatry to radiology. </p>
                  <p>Abrams provided valuable details about Stanford’s original medical school in San
              Francisco. From 1948 until 1959, Abrams served first as a resident and then as a
              professor at San Francisco General Hospital and Stanford Lane Hospital. Abrams found
              the experience both challenging and exciting because, due to the small-staff
              environment, faculty acted as both administrators and clinicians. Abrams also
              discussed the increasing importance of faculty research efforts after the medical
              school moved to the Stanford campus in 1959, highlighting developments in biplane
              imagery, catheter procedures, and radiation effect studies. </p>
                  <p>Against the backdrop of his move from Stanford to Harvard, Abrams turned his
              attention to his longstanding interest in social activism and growing concern
              regarding nuclear weapons. Although he previously worked with the Physicians for
              Social Responsibility group, Abrams’ efforts pivoted towards promoting a more
              international organization called the International Physicians for the Prevention of
              Nuclear War. This group studied all matters related to nuclear weapons, worked to
              raise awareness, and educated Congress about the effects of nuclear war.</p>
                  <p>Abrams went on to discuss his return to Stanford in 1985 and his continued shift from
              a focus on diagnostic radiology to nuclear weapons research and activism.
              Increasingly, Abrams spent time at Stanford’s Center for International Security and
              Cooperation studying the effects of nuclear weapons exposure and the intersection of
              weapons access and mental health. In conclusion, Abrams addressed the need to educate
              the public about present-day nuclear threats and discussed the various leisure
              interests he pursued in this post-retirement period.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history from 2017, the noted econometrician Takeshi Amemiya, Edward Ames
              Edmonds Professor of Economics, Emeritus, describes his early life in wartime Japan,
              his education in economics, and his years on the faculty of the Department of
              Economics at Stanford University. His wife, Yoshiko Miyaki Amemiya, briefly describes
              meeting Amemiya in Japan and her experience of life at Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Amemiya begins by describing how Advanced Econometrics, a comprehensive text that is
              still in print three decades after its initial publication in 1985, evolved from
              material he used to teach the subject when he first came to Stanford in 1964. About
              that time, Amemiya explains, microdata on individual households and companies began to
              become available. Amemiya developed the statistical methods to analyze such data, and
              he was the first to write a textbook on the subject.</p>
                  <p>Elaborating on his early years at Stanford, Amemiya explains that the faculty of the
              Department of Economics were assigned to different campus buildings, depending on
              their interests. He says this tended to deter collaboration until the department was
              consolidated at Encina Hall in the 1970s.</p>
                  <p>Amemiya jumps ahead to discuss his later interests: sharing his delight in
              discovering the similarities of Greek and Japanese customs, including the gods they
              worshipped and their shrines to the dead. In addition, after traveling in China, he
              began to write poetry in Chinese.</p>
                  <p>Turning to his childhood, Amemiya says he was only seven at the outbreak of World War
              II, which found his family in Lima, Peru, where his father worked as an executive for
              a Japanese shipping line. He describes being caught up in an exchange of Japanese and
              U.S. citizens living abroad at the outbreak of war. Although he was evacuated from
              Tokyo during the war, he experienced air raids in the area near Mount Fuji to which he
              had been sent.</p>
                  <p>Amemiya describes his time at the International Christian University in Japan,
              Guilford College in North Carolina, and the American University in Washington, DC and
              admits to sometimes being distracted from his studies by American novels and golf. At
              Johns Hopkins University, Amemiya says a connection with econometrist Carl F. Christ
              set him on a career course that led him to join the faculty of the Stanford Department
              of Economics. Stanford then was more comfortable and less pressured than today,
              Amemiya says, offering his criticism of today’s practice of allowing students to
              evaluate professors, arguing that this encourages overly rehearsed teaching. Instead,
              he recalls putting new problems on the board and solving them with the students.</p>
                  <p>Yoshiko Amemiya recounts how she met and married the young professor during a brief
              period when he left Stanford to teach in Japan. She also shares some of the challenges
              she experienced adapting to American culture, especially in feeling comfortable with
              the informality of the English language.</p>
                  <p>Amemiya concludes by briefly describing the anti-Vietnam War protests at Stanford and
              recalling some memorable faculty rivalries on the tennis court.</p>

                  <p>The interview encompasses Professor Anderson’s long life, starting with his
              background as the son of a college president and continuing with his undergraduate
              degree from Northwestern University and Ph.D. from Princeton University. After one
              year at Cowles Commission on Research in Economics, he moved on to Columbia University
              Faculty from 1946-67, and has been at Stanford since then. He retired at age 70,
              maintains his writing and research. At the time of the interview he was 93 years
              old.</p>
                  <p>Professor Anderson is a leading authority in Econometrics and held a dual appointment
              at Stanford in the Department of Statistics and the Economics Department. Prof.
              Anderson came to Stanford because of the quality of colleagues in both departments and
              greater support for the program than was available at Columbia. He had numerous
              students from overseas, particularly but not exclusively from Asia and has maintained
              social and academic relations with many foreign students.</p>
                  <p>He was one of the first people at Stanford to hold appointments in two departments.
              It worked well because he declined to be the chair of either department. The dual
              appointment may have cost him the ability to have an endowed chair.</p>

                  <p>Theodore (Ted) Wilbur Anderson (born June 5, 1918) is an American mathematician and
              statistician who specialized in the analysis of multivariate data. Born in
              Minneapolis, Minnesota, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946. He was on the
              faculty of Columbia University from 1946 until moving to Stanford University in 1967,
              becoming Emeritus Professor in 1988. He served as Editor of Annals of Mathematical
              Statistics from 1950 to 1952. He was elected President of the Institute of
              Mathematical Statistics in 1962. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of
              Arts and Sciences in 1974.</p>
                  <p>Anderson's 1958 textbook, An Introduction to Multivariate Analysis, educated a
              generation of theorists and applied statisticians; Anderson's book emphasizes
              hypothesis testing via likelihood ratio tests and the properties of power functions:
              Admissibility, unbiasedness and monotonicity. Anderson is also known for
              Anderson–Darling test of whether there is evidence that a given sample of data did not
              arise from a given probability distribution. He also framed the Anderson–Bahadur
              algorithm along with Raghu Raj Bahadur which is used in statistics and engineering for
              solving binary classification problems when the underlying data have multivariate
              normal distributions with different covariance matrices. He is a member of the
              Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.</p>
                  <p>Professor Theodore W. Anderson turned 90 in June, 2008. To celebrate this milestone,
              the Departments of Statistics and Economics organized a special conference in his
              honor over June 6th and 7th. In presenting their research, the invited speakers
              pointed out Professor Anderson’s fundamental contributions and the over-arching
              influence of his early work. Kenneth Arrow, 1972 Nobel Laureate in Economics, gave an
              overview of the early developments in econometrics in his talk, "Some Reminiscences of
              Econometrics in the 1940s", and profiled Professor Anderson’s contribution to
              econometrics during his time on the Cowles Commission. The list of conference speakers
              included many of Professor Anderson’s former students, co-authors, and colleagues.</p>
                  <p>Professor Anderson’s 1945 doctoral dissertation was scanned for the occasion and made
              available as a .pdf file from the conference web page. The impact of this paper on
              econometrics and multivariate analysis was noted by several speakers, and the scanned
              version was unveiled to Professor Anderson on the second day of the conference. At the
              concluding session that day, a special issue (Number 9, Volume 138) of the Journal of
              Statistical Planning and Inference published in recognition of his birthday was
              presented to Professor Anderson by J.N. Srivastava, Editor-in-Chief of the
              journal.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>A native of Greece, born in Athens on Feb. 12, 1929, Spyros Andreopoulos learned
              English in German-occupied Salonica as a teen, served as a communications liaison in
              Greece’s air force during the Korean War, and studied journalism in the United States,
              where he married and remained, working in public relations and journalism, earning
              recognition among reporters and public-relations specialists as an unusually
              well-informed, honest and sometimes bold broker of medical news. In the spring of
              1939, Andreopoulos was accepted by the Koryalenion School at the island Spetsai, an
              exclusive private school regarded as the Greek version of Eton. But by then war in
              Europe was looming and his father decided that it would be best if he attended
              Anatolia College instead, an American high school near Salonica — so that if
              hostilities broke out, he would be near home. War came to Greece in 1940 when Italy
              invaded from Albania and was defeated. Hitler came to Mussolini’s aid and the German
              army invaded Greece in the spring of 1941. The American high school was closed down,
              and its campus and buildings were taken over by the German occupation authorities. The
              American teaching staff left for the states, but the Greek teachers who remained
              behind rented a building in Salonica and continued to give English lessons.
              Andreopoulos enrolled at the new school and took English lessons during the entire
              German occupation. After the British liberated Greece in 1944, Andreopoulos’ first
              summer job was a clerical position with the electrical parts division of the British
              army’s supply corps. He finished high school in 1946, then studied at the University
              of Athens in 1948-49. He found being drafted by the air force for a 24-month military
              service was a blessing in disguise. Andreopoulos got his first experiences as a
              diplomat as the designated spokesman for a squadron of seven Douglas C-47 transport
              planes (known as gooney birds) contributed by Greece to the U.S. effort in Korea.</p>
                  <p>The Korean War also provided Andreopoulos his first journalism experiences. While
              serving, he recorded interviews with the troops for Radio Athens and played the role
              of reporter for the first time. Though he was trained in flight control, his knowledge
              of English led to his first job in communications. After the war, Andreopoulos
              returned to Greece and worked for the United States Information Agency, helping
              produce a series of films on the accomplishments of the Marshall Plan in Greece. In
              1953, his boss sent him to the University of Kansas in Manhattan to prep for a series
              of films teaching Greek farmers to use modern agricultural methods. The next year the
              film series was canned, but Andreopoulos was able to stay in the United States.</p>
                  <p>With the help of the Institute of International Education, he applied for
              scholarships to the schools of journalism at Northwestern, University of Missouri,
              University of Kansas and Wichita University, now Wichita State University. He was
              offered scholarships by all, but Wichita gave him a deal he couldn’t refuse — a $2,000
              scholarship, plus free room and board. In 1955, while still a student in Wichita, he
              joined the Wichita Beacon newspaper as a reporter covering the education and science
              beats and two years later he became assistant editorial page editor.</p>
                  <p>In 1959, the famous psychiatrist Karl Menninger asked Andreopoulos to join the The
              Menninger Foundation as assistant director of information services and editor of The
              Menninger Quarterly. In 1963, Andreopoulos was lured away from his work at the
              renowned psychiatric clinic and school in Topeka, Kan., by an offer from Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Once at Stanford, Andreopoulos found himself with plenty of administrative matters to
              write about — and plenty of news to get out. He wrote about tensions between the
              medical center and the city of Palo Alto, the creation of a virus in a test-tube, the
              first heart transplant in the United States and the Asilomar Conference on the safety
              of research using bioengineered materials.</p>
                  <p>Though he was not a member of Stanford’s faculty, Andreopoulos commanded the respect
              and attention of leaders in medicine at Stanford and beyond. Andreopoulos not only
              served as spokesman for the medical school, advisor to the school’s leaders and
              director of the news office, he was a prolific and insightful writer himself. Among
              the issues Andreopoulos took up over the years: the dangers of conflicts of interest
              in medical research, the strengths of single-payer health coverage and methods for
              avoiding hype in reporting biomedical research.</p>
                  <p>As director of Stanford’s medical news office, Andreopoulos served as the school’s
              official spokesman and also as editor of Stanford M.D. magazine and its successor,
              Stanford Medicine, which he founded. He became director emeritus in 1993.</p>
                  <p>In addition to his work for Stanford, Andreopoulos is a prolific writer. Over his
              career he edited and contributed to a book series on socioeconomic aspects of health
              care; published on medicine and social policy in professional journals and the lay
              press — including dozens of op-eds for the San Francisco Chronicle — and co-authored a
              medical novel (Heart Beat, Putnam-Coward, 1978).</p>
                  <p>Other noteworthy Andreopoulos writings include Aging of America &amp; the Role of the
              Academic Health Center (John Wiley &amp; Sons, September 1988) and The Unhealthy
              Alliance Between Academia and Corporate America (West J Med, October 2001) concerning
              the distorting influences of the commercialization of academic science on university
              research. He also edited and contributed to a book series on socioeconomic aspects of
              health care: Medical Cure and Medical Care (Milbank Memorial Fund, 1972); Primary
              Care: Where Medicine Fails (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1974); National Health Insurance:
              Can We Learn from Canada? (Krieger, 1975); and with John Hogness, MD, Health Care for
              an Aging Society (Churchill Livingstone, 1990).</p>
                  <p>As a member of the board and editor of the Sun Valley Forum on National Health, a
              think tank co-founded in 1972 by the late Averill Harriman and based in Sun Valley,
              Idaho, Andreopoulos authored and published policy papers on a range of topics. Since
              1995 he has also contributed more than 60 commentaries to the San Francisco Chronicle,
              San Jose Mercury-News and other newspapers. The topics have ranged from medical
              education and research to drug company advertising, health-care policy issues and the
              uninsured.</p>
                  <p>Andreopoulos’ books have received several honors. His Primary Care: Where Medicine
              Fails received the Best Book Award from the American Medical Writers Association in
              1975, and National Health Insurance: Can We Learn from Canada? was named Book of the
              Year by the American Nurses Association in 1976.</p>
                  <p>He received several consecutive exceptional achievement awards from the Association
              of American Medical Colleges for “excellence in medical education public affairs.” On
              the year of his retirement, the magazine also received the Sibley Award for
              excellence, the highest honor accorded to university alumni magazines.</p>
                  <p>Andreopoulos has served on the boards of the California Division of the American
              Cancer Society and the National Association of Science Writers. He is a member of
              American Medical Writers Association. He has served as a consultant on public
              relations and communication to the National Cancer Institute and several academic
              medical centers, and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, the Markey Charitable
              Trust, and the Lucile and David Packard Foundation. In the early 1970s he advised PBS
              and the National Science Foundation during the initial planning and launching of the
              NOVA television series. Andreopoulos lives on the Stanford campus with his wife,
              Christiane, who for many years taught French at Castilleja School, an all-girls middle
              and high school in Palo Alto, Calif., and is now retired.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this four-part interview, Professor Emeritus Kenneth Joseph Arrow discussed his
              long and varied career. He began with a description of his family background and an
              extensive explanation of his educational background, from the early signs of a gifted
              intelligence through a special accelerated high school program and on to college and
              graduate school. His years in a doctoral program at Columbia’s department of economics
              was interrupted by military service during WWII, during which time Arrow received
              master’s level training in meteorology. Upon returning to Columbia, he completed his
              dissertation. Parts one and two of the interview transcripts include several examples
              of teachers, colleagues, and other mentors in his education and early career. This
              career took him to many places, and in the interviews, Arrow explained his work for
              the RAND Corporation and the Cowles Commission in Chicago before moving to Stanford
              for its departments of economics and statistics.</p>
                  <p>In part three, Professor Arrow detailed much of his Stanford career, including his
              pride in the creation of the Department of Operations Research, SIEPR, and IMSSS. He
              also gave a lengthy argument for his perspectives on the value of interdisciplinary
              work. This part of the interview contains descriptions of many of Stanford’s faculty,
              particularly those in statistics and economics, and the department practices of
              administration, hiring, and recruitment. Arrow offered reactions to his service in the
              Faculty Senate and the Advisory Board of the Academic Council, his takes on the
              administrations of several of Stanford’s presidents, his time at Harvard, and his
              subsequent return to Stanford in 1979. Part three also includes Arrow’s Nobel Memorial
              Prize for Economics with Sir John Hicks in 1972.</p>
                  <p>The final part of the interview examined Arrow’s life since his retirement in 1991,
              focusing on his further intellectual explorations and his thoughts on the nature of
              knowledge and subjective belief. He also spoke of some of the accomplishments and
              challenges of his Stanford tenure. The interviews conclude with a brief look at some
              of his extracurricular activities and his extended family.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Kenneth Joseph Arrow is a Nobel Prize-winning economist whose work has been primarily
              in economic theory and operations, focusing on areas including social choice theory,
              risk bearing, medical economics, general equilibrium analysis, inventory theory, and
              the economics of information and innovation. He was one of the first economists to
              note the existence of a learning curve, and he also showed that under certain
              conditions an economy reaches a general equilibrium. In 1972, together with Sir John
              Hicks, he won the Nobel Prize in economics, for his pioneering contributions to
              general equilibrium theory and welfare theory.</p>
                  <p>Arrow was born in New York City in 1921 to parents who came to America from Russia as
              children. A gifted student who skipped two grades, Kenneth J. Arrow studied at a
              Townsend Harris High School and then attended the City College of New York. His major
              was mathematics, and he became interested in the developing field of mathematical
              statistics. Arrow went on to graduate study at Columbia University. Statistics was not
              then recognized as a separate department; Arrow decided to follow his mentor, Harold
              Hotelling, to Economics.</p>
                  <p>During World War II, Arrow enrolled as a weather officer in the US Air Force. He was
              sent to New York University with his class for the equivalent of a master’s degree in
              meteorology. He was then assigned to research in forecasting and served in that
              capacity until discharged in December 1945, at which point he returned to graduate
              studies. In 1947, Arrow accepted a position in the Cowles Commission for Research in
              Economics, where he worked with colleagues such as later Nobel laureates Lawrence
              Klein, Leonid Hurwicz, and Franco Modigliani, and statisticians like Herman Rubin and
              Herman Chernoff. In 1948, Arrow accepted an invitation to spend the summer at the RAND
              Corporation.</p>
                  <p>Arrow arrived at Stanford in 1949 and remained through 1968, rising to full
              professor, also serving as Head of the department for three years. He served the
              university on several studies and as a member of the Executive Committee of the
              Academic Council. Among his noteworthy contributions was the creation of the
              Operations Research program, which eventually became a department in the School of
              Engineering. Arrow spent 1968-1979 at Harvard University before returning to Stanford
              until his retirement in 1991.</p>

                  <p>Ray Bacchetti, Vice President for Planning and Management, Emeritus, was an
              administrator at Stanford from 1963 to 1993. In this interview he talked first about
              his upbringing and his early administrative career while pursuing a Ph.D. at
              Stanford’s School of Education. He became an Assistant Provost in 1968 and assumed
              increasingly broad and influential positions in the President and Provost’s Office for
              the next 25 years. He discussed Stanford’s system of budgeting and financial
              management in some detail, including topics such as tuition setting, periods of
              significant budget cutting, endowment policies, restricted funds, and indirect cost
              recovery. Other topics covered in the interview included diversity and affirmative
              action, undergraduate financial aid, the Management Development Program, higher
              education management and administration, EST (Erhard Seminars Training), Stanford
              leadership, and his receipt of the Kenneth M. Cuthbertson Award. When his Vice
              President position was eliminated, he spent the next eight years at the Hewlett
              Foundation as the Education Program Officer, and also worked at the Carnegie
              Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. He also discussed some of his extensive
              community service including on the Palo Alto School Board. His perspectives on
              Stanford as a great institution were informed, philosophical, and modest.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Barnes described his childhood growing up in Ohio, his early education and
              professional career as a symphony musician and conductor in the Midwest and Fresno,
              California, and his subsequent move to Stanford to obtain his doctorate in conducting.
              Dr. Barnes discussed his recollection of the growth and contraction of the Music
              Department in the 1960s through the mid-1990s, and his teaching career. Finally, Dr.
              Barnes discussed his direction of and involvement with the Stanford Band during the
              same period, including interaction with the administration and alumni, musicianship,
              student direction of the band and anecdotes about his travel with the Band.</p>

                  <p>Arthur P. Barnes’ early career included serving as supervisor of music in an Ohio
              public school district and on the music faculties of Southern Illinois University and
              Fresno State. He is an accomplished jazz and classical pianist and has worked
              professionally as a trombone player and bassoonist in the Wichita Symphony, the Fort
              Wayne Philharmonic, and the Fresno Symphony. His primary conducting mentor was Richard
              Lert, with whom he worked for four summers as a conducting fellow under the auspices
              of the American Symphony Orchestra League (now the League of American Orchestras). Dr.
              Barnes also spent a summer workshop studying with conductor Eric Leinsdorf, and
              composer Roy Harris was his primary composition teacher as well as a close personal
              friend. Barnes has appeared as a guest conductor, clinician, and adjudicator in
              Australia, Japan, England, the Philippines, and the U.S.</p>
                  <p>Art Barnes took over the podium of the Livermore-Amador Symphony in the fall of 1964.
              During his first year as conductor in Livermore he completed his doctorate in
              orchestral conducting at Stanford University and was offered a full-time appointment
              in the university’s music department. He served as director of bands, conductor of the
              chamber orchestra and of the wind ensemble, and professor of theory, orchestration,
              ear training, and score reading. He also holds a bachelor's degree in music education
              and a master's in theory and composition. Since his retirement a $2 million endowment
              has been established in his name by former students and friends to fund his
              successor.</p>
                  <p>The 2012-2013 season marked his 49th season as conductor and musical director of the
              Livermore- Amador Symphony. In addition to his activities as a teacher and conductor
              he is an active performer, arranger and accompanist. His arrangement of the "Star
              Spangled Banner" has won national acclaim. In the past fifteen years, Dr. Barnes has
              spent several summers in residence at the University of York, and has served as guest
              conductor at a concert sponsored by the York Music Centre.</p>
                  <p>During the over four decades of his involvement with the Livermore-Amador Symphony
              his entire family has performed as members of the orchestra or as soloists - his wife
              and son on French horn, one daughter on violin, another on bassoon, and a
              granddaughter on cello. His eclectic background and skills have strongly contributed
              to the success and longevity of the Symphony.</p>

              Aquarium, which have had a deep and lasting impact on both the area and the general
              public’s perception of our oceans.</p>
                  <p>He begins the interview discussing his background, most notably how a chance
              invitation to go diving in the Pacific Ocean opened his eyes to the wonders of
              underwater ecosystems` and caused him to change his major at UCLA from engineering to
              zoology. From there he traces a path from his graduate work in Ted Bullock’s lab to
              teaching the undergraduate zoology lab to his recruitment as a lecturer in the
              Stanford University Department of Biology. </p>
                  <p>Baxter explains the circumstances that resulted in the transfer of his teaching
              duties to the Hopkins Marine Station and his relocation to the Monterey area. He
              recalls fondly the community of faculty, staff, and students at the marine station in
              the mid 1970s that made it such a special place to work. Baxter discusses his classes
              and the undergraduate research projects he assisted with, including one that resulted
              in two undergraduates publishing one of the first papers to show the effects of
              greenhouse gases on the distributions of ocean communities. </p>
                  <p>Beyond his academic life at Hopkins, Baxter relates the notable projects he and his
              colleagues put into motion. He talks about how the Monterey Bay Aquarium came to be,
              relating key aspects of the aquarium’s construction, including the kelp forest tank,
              the aviary, and preservation of the beached grey whale skeleton that now hangs in the
              reception hall. Peppered throughout the interview are anecdotes about David Packard,
              who along with his wife, Lucille, was a chief funder of the project. He explains the
              diving and recording technologies that were central to the formation of the Monterey
              Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and the media production company Sea Studios
              Foundation--organizations in which he played an active role. Finally, Baxter recounts
              the organization and deployment of the Sea of Cortez Expedition and Education Project,
              which retraced the 1940 journey of John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts, and how
              conversations with his fellow passengers led to his involvement in Stanford’s holistic
              biology course and his current interest in cognitive science research.</p>

              Europe, and her broad education in US, Germany, and England. She credits her extensive
              travels in her youth for evoking her curiosity about everything. </p>
                  <p>Blau recalls her studies at Harvard where she met her husband, their move to

              University of California-San Francisco before joining Stanford in 1978. She details
              how her career took off at Stanford as she applied her training, curiosity and
              interdisciplinary bent to the research in stem cell technology and regenerative
              medicine. She discusses how interdisciplinary collaborations were important to her
              academic success. Last but not least, Blau fondly recalls her relationship with her
              students, many of them were women.</p>

                  <p>Gordon H. Bower, the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology, Emeritus, is a
              well-known cognitive psychologist. In his six-part oral history Gordon Bower traces
              the evolution of his career from his childhood, baseball playing, and education in
              Ohio to his retirement and current life at Stanford. Bower devotes the bulk of the
              interview to elaborating on his research program, beginning at Yale as a graduate
              student and continuing through his time at Stanford. He describes his work in learning
              and memory, including the study of human memory, mnemonic devices, retrieval
              strategies, recording strategies, and category learning. Bower also discusses his
              research on cognitive processes, emotion, imagery, language and reading comprehension
              as they relate to memory. In addition to his own research, Bower examines the work of
              colleagues and others who influenced him, including developments both within and
              outside of psychology. Bower recounts his service as associate dean and member of the
              Appointments and Promotions Committee at Stanford, president of the American
              Psychological Society, chief science advisor to the director of the National
              Institutes of Mental Health, and editor of the annual book series The Psychology of
              Learning and Motivation.</p>

                  <p>John I. Brauman speaks about growing up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his
              education at MIT and UC Berkeley. Recruited to Stanford as a young assistant professor
              of chemistry in 1963, he discusses how the support of Provost Fred Terman and the
              leadership of department chair Bill Johnson transformed the department through
              recruitment of world-class scientists. He talks about his research, important
              collaborations with his colleagues, teaching undergraduates, and serving as department
              chair. Brauman comments on several of his many roles outside the department: as the

                  <p>Arthur E. Bryson, Jr., a professor emeritus in the Stanford University Department of
              Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, discusses his research and teaching career in
              aeronautical engineering and his contributions to the fields of flight mechanics and
              automated control.</p>
                  <p>Bryson begins with a discussion of his childhood in Illinois, recalling impressions
              of his father’s work as an investment banker in Chicago, his education in the Winnetka
              Public Schools, and the impact of a high school math teacher on his life path. He
              describes the beginning of his undergraduate career at Haverford College, which was
              interrupted by World War II and his participation in the Navy’s V-5 program.</p>
                  <p>He talks about his eventual training assignment at Iowa State College and describes
              how he met his future wife, Helen Layton, there. The ensuing years found Bryson
              stationed at the Alameda Naval Station, working in repair and maintenance, and he
              describes some of his experiences there. Bryson then speaks about his short stint as a
              paper manufacturing engineer working for the Container Corporation of America and as
              an aeronautical engineer at United Aircraft, where he began working with wind
              tunnels.</p>
                  <p>In the late 1940s, Bryson migrated to California to pursue a master’s degree in
              aeronautical engineering with the help of the GI Bill. He describes his advisor, Hans
              W. Liepmann, and relates how at Liepmann’s invitation, and with the help of a
              fellowship from Hughes Aircraft, he stayed on at Cal-tech, completing his PhD in
              1951.</p>
                  <p>An important turning point in Bryson’s career was an encounter with Harvard professor
              Howard Wilson Emmons, who was assigned to be Bryson’s office mate while Emmons was on
              a short assignment at Hughes. Bryson relates the circumstances that led Emmons to ask
              him to join the faculty at Harvard as an assistant professor in the Department of
              Mechanical Engineering in 1963. He offers a short account of departmental and family
              life and his research and consulting work while at Harvard, and notes that the
              increasingly contentious atmosphere surrounding the Vietnam War was one of the factors
              that led him to accept an invitation to join the Stanford engineering faculty in
              1968.</p>
                  <p>Bryson describes some of the opportunities and challenges of his new role as the
              chair of the Department of Applied Mechanics, and later the Department of Aeronautics
              and Astronautics. He comments on his approach to teaching engineering and working with
              graduate students, recalls his work on Waves in Fluids and some of the other films in
              the Fluid Mechanics Films series, and relates stories about the anti-Vietnam War
              protests on campus.</p>
                  <p>He concludes the interview with comments on the Gravity Probe B project and
              reflections on recent directions in biomechanical engineering and flight
              mechanics.</p>

              and then kept some of its wealth, though by no means all, in the great depression in
              the 1930s. Things began for him with a run of bad luck when his father, who had been
              in the naval air force during World War I, reenlisted in World War II and died in a
              plane crash while on a tour of duty in South America. His older half-brother died
              during what came to be called the Battle of the Bulge. This unlucky beginning has been
              followed by a run of good luck, during a lifetime now in its ninth decade, that
              Carnochan sometimes finds hard to believe.</p>
                  <p>After an east coast schooling – elementary school in Manhattan, boarding school in
              New England, Harvard University (where his grandfather, father and brother had gone) –
              Carnochan passed an idle year at New College, Oxford, spending much of his time rowing
              on the college crew, not because he had a special aptitude but because a 6’2” American
              had an initial advantage that reality never quite dissipated. He had put his name down
              in the Harvard jobs office for a position teaching school, presumably some school such
              as he’d attended himself. Then luck intervened. In the mid-winter cold of Oxford there
              arrived a telegram from Harvard’s Dean of Freshmen (whose unlikely name was F. Skiddy
              von Stade), inviting Carnochan to be an assistant dean of freshmen, a position known
              in Harvard circles as a “baby” dean. Carnochan said yes, not realizing how little a
              sheltered life had prepared him for the experience. But he survived.</p>
                  <p>A perquisite of the assistant dean’s job was free courses in Graduate School. After
              two years as dean and one as acting senior tutor in one of the Harvard houses,
              Carnochan finished his Ph.D. with a dissertation he doesn’t care ever to see again;
              and, thanks to another stroke of luck, came west to Stanford. The year before,
              Carnochan had taken a summer course in Cambridge with the chair of the Stanford
              English Department, Virgil Whitaker. He liked Carnochan’s work and offered Carnochan a
              job without even requiring a visit. When Carnochan left the east coast in July, 1960,
              he’d never before been west of Pittsburgh. As he drove down from the Sierra toward
              Sacramento, he stopped at a gas station and said to the attendant, “Is it always this
              hot?” Seeing Carnochan’s New Jersey license plate, the attendant shrugged. In 1960,
              Stanford was still early in its astonishing rise to prominence. A somewhat sleepy,
              somewhat provincial university – now helped along by federal monies and the advent of
              rapid travel from coast to coast – found itself on the way to greatness.
              Notwithstanding the tumult of the 1960s and early 1970s, and to some extent because of
              it, life in the university then was a source of unending stimulation. Carnochan became
              chair of the English Department in 1970 at a time when disciplinary proceedings
              against Bruce Franklin were under way. It was not a job anyone else particularly
              wanted. Carnochan said he’d do it for a year and ended up doing it for two. Then, from
              1975 to 1980 he was Dean of Graduate Studies and, starting in 1976, vice provost.</p>
                  <p>The most rewarding years of Carnochan’s academic life were from 1986 to 1991 when he
              was director of the Stanford Humanities Center. While serving as Dean of Graduate
              Studies, he had helped conceive the idea of a Humanities Center at Stanford. In the
              six years he was director, Carnochan learned a great deal from the Center’s annual
              community of intellectually engaged scholars – internal faculty, external faculty and
              graduate students. After thirty years of writing and thinking about the British
              eighteenth century, his experience at the Center inspired him to look farther afield.
              Carnochan retired in 1994 in the hope of writing more about more things. It has worked
              out as he hoped it would.</p>
                  <p>Carnochan’s wife Brigitte is a skilled fine art photographer. She has a daughter, he
              has three daughters and a son, and they have ten grandchildren between them. In
              Carnochan’s words, it has been not just a fortunate life but a rich one.</p>
                  <p>This biography was originally written by W. Bliss Carnochan on September 7, 2013 and
              then slightly revised for this oral history.</p>

                  <p>William M. Chace is Professor of English and President Emeritus of Emory University
              and Honorary Professor Emeritus of English at Stanford University. In his interview,
              he discusses the changes in higher education nationally and at Stanford University
              from 1956 to 2015, a time when colleges and universities transitioned from educating
              for citizenry to educating for participation in the economy and when funding sources
              also changed. </p>
                  <p>Chace discusses his experience teaching at Stillman College as a Woodrow Wilson
              Scholar and his graduate education at the University of California, Berkeley,
              including witnessing Free Speech Movement protests. He describes his days as an
              assistant professor in the Stanford English Department, recalling campus protests
              against the Vietnam War, his experience teaching a course in African-American
              literature in response to demands from the Black Student Union, and his colleague in
              the English Department, Bruce Franklin. </p>
                  <p>Chace reflects on the increasing specialization of faculty and its impact on the
              teaching of general knowledge courses. He discusses factors that have contributed to
              the declining importance of the humanities from the perspective of university
              administrators, and he recalls debates over the teaching of Western Culture at
              Stanford. He recounts the birth and progress of Stanford’s Continuing Studies program
              and gives his impressions on the value and rewards of skilled teaching.</p>

                  <p>Robert “Bob” Chase begins with his early life growing up in Keene, New Hampshire, the
              influence of his parents and older brother on his life, and time at Keene High School,
              noting that that is where he met Ann Parker Chase, his wife of 68 years. He discusses
              pursuing his undergraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, his time in the
              US Navy, and his studies at Yale medical school. He goes on to relate how he completed
              his surgical residency as an active-duty member of the US Army, and how he came to
              specialize in upper limb surgery.</p>
                  <p>He discusses his three postings to Italy and the joy he and his family found in their
              time there. He explains his decision to leave the military and return to Yale, his
              involvement in the establishment of the first plastic surgery section there, and
              subsequently the first hand section. He moves on to discuss his tenure as Head of the
              Department of Surgery at Stanford, including anecdotes about some of the many people
              he recruited to the department. He details his activities with Interplast and other
              experiences doing surgery in underdeveloped nations, recalls his experiences with
              curriculum changes, and then talks about the change in approach from system specialty
              to regional specialty and how it affected practitioners and patients. He discusses
              changes in the practice of medicine during his tenure as head of surgery, and how the
              department changed after he left.</p>
                  <p>He recalls the on-campus turmoil of the 1960s-70s and how it affected the medical
              school. He then talks about his service on the Stanford Advisory Board and his work on
              the National Board of Examiners, his dual appointment in Surgery and Structural
              Biology, his teaching of human anatomy, his involvement with the Bassett Collection
              and the development of other technological tools for teaching anatomy. He discusses
              changes in the approach to cadaver dissection over the years. He talks about his
              service on the Stanford University Hospital board.</p>
                  <p>Chase discusses the founding of the Chase Hand Center, and expands upon how regional
              focus changed medical school curriculums. He returns to his involvement in the
              transfer of the Division of Anatomy from Structural Biology to Surgery. He discusses
              the tradition he began of taking students to see The Rodin Collection as an anatomy
              tool. He also talks about the development of his sensitivity to patients’ quality of
              life and the role of reconstructive surgery in same. He ruminates on the joys and
              frustrations of being in leadership roles. He talks about the financial challenges
              medical students face, about his philosophy of teaching, how he developed it, and his
              receipt of the Kaiser Award. He highlights some of his involvement in professional
              associations and some of the awards he has received.</p>
                  <p>He returns to the discussion of his time in Italy, including his development of a
              class in Anatomy and Renaissance Art. He elaborates on his use of technology and the
              Bassett Collection in teaching. He ends with a discussion of his many visiting
              professorships</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, Jean H. Chu (formerly Jean H. Fetter) discusses her
              twenty-five-year career at Stanford University where she served as Dean of
              Undergraduate Admissions, as assistant to two university presidents (Richard W. Lyman
              and Gerhard Casper), and in other administrative capacities.</p>
                  <p>Chu begins with an account of her childhood in Wales during World War II, when German
              bombings demolished nearby Swansea and frequently sent her scrambling for shelter.
              Raised by a great-aunt and great-uncle, she recalls how her youthful interest in
              mathematics and physics was fostered at a rigorous all-women’s high school. Her
              excellence there helped gain admission to Oxford University’s all-women’s college, St.
              Hugh’s. In vivid detail, Chu recounts her experiences as one of six women, compared to
              120 men, studying physics at Oxford. She was awarded a first in physics, among the
              best in her class.</p>
                  <p>During her Oxford years, she met and married American Alexander (Sandy) Fetter (now
              Professor Emeritus of Physics at Stanford), and she discusses accompanying him to
              successive faculty appointments at Harvard, Berkeley, and finally Stanford. Describing
              life as a faculty wife and mother of small children, she recalls a brief job with
              William Shockley that led to a teaching position and then assistant professorship in
              physics at San Jose State.</p>
                  <p>Turning to her employment at Stanford, Chu discusses her work with David Halliburton
              of the English Department on two grant-funded projects that she used to promote
              recruitment of women in sciences. She credits the broad perspective of Stanford that
              she gained during that project with helping her win appointment as assistant to
              Stanford President Richard W. Lyman. She recalls a heavy workload filtering the
              barrage of mail and in-person complaints brought to the president. Described as a “cog
              between big wheels,” she says, she learned about how the university operated at the
              highest level.</p>
                  <p>Chu offers a brief account of her time as Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and
              Research under Jerry Lieberman where she oversaw the recruitment of women and
              minorities into graduate programs at Stanford and worked to develop grievance
              procedures for graduate students.</p>
                  <p>Much of the oral history involves the many challenges she faced as Dean of
              Admissions. She describes the conflict she confronted between those who supported
              recruiting “well-rounded” students and others who favored “angular” students (“nerds”
              with extraordinary talents). Chu tells how she enabled the Department of Mathematics
              and later the departments of Music, Art, Drama, and Dance to review outstanding
              applicants in their fields, using the model created for athletes. She explains other
              policies she initiated and provides a detailed description of the review process,
              recounting some unusual cases as well as special efforts to recruit minorities and
              women.</p>
                  <p>Chu outlines her service on the search committee that selected Gerhard Casper to be
              the new university president and the circumstances that led her to accept the role as
              his assistant. She contrasts her experiences as assistant to Lyman and Casper.</p>
                  <p>Concluding her remarks, Chu recalls her experiences with her second husband, Steven
              Chu, when he received the Nobel Prize in physics.</p>

                  <p>Eve V. Clark, Richard W. Lyman Professor of Humanities and an internationally known
              linguist, reviews her life journey from the United Kingdom to the United States.</p>
                  <p>Clark begins by discussing her childhood in Britain, emphasizing her relationship
              with her sister, and her early education. Clark recounts traveling with her family,
              reflecting particularly on her time in France and the impact that learning the French
              language at a young age has had on her. She then describes her time at the University
              of Edinburgh and her time studying abroad in Aux-en-Provence and Barcelona. Clark then
              discusses how her interest in linguistics developed, accrediting the year-long
              phonetics course she had previously completed and her decision to attend the
              Linguistics Institute at the University of California Los Angeles.</p>
                  <p>Clark describes meeting her husband, Herb, completing her PhD, and coming to
              Stanford. Clark comments on her experience as an academic couple and on how she
              managed having a career and a family. Clark talks extensively about her research in
              language acquisition, describing past studies she has conducted and textbooks she has
              produced. She then details her work with undergraduates, the classes she has taught,
              and her time serving on multiple advisory boards. Clark then describes in more detail
              her time at Stanford, recounting how the Linguistics Department has evolved, the Loma
              Prieta earthquake, student discontent in the 1970s, the committees she had served on,
              and how being a woman has impacted her career, and her consciousness of the feminist
              movement.</p>
                  <p>The interview concludes with Clark commenting on how Stanford can continue to
              cultivate a more hospitable environment for women and by reminiscing on how the
              students at Stanford, and their motivation and energy, has driven her decision to
              continue teaching at the university.</p>

                  <p>In the first of two interviews with Kandis Scott, Richard W. “Dick” Cottle gives a
              brief account of his birth in Chicago and education in neighboring Oak Park, Illinois.
              He reflects on his undergraduate and graduate studies in mathematics: first at Harvard
              and then (after a two-year interlude of prep-school mathematics teaching) at the
              University of California, Berkeley where he had the good fortune of working at the
              Radiation Laboratory and the Operations Research Center with George Dantzig. Cottle
              relates how upon completion of his doctoral studies, he took a position at Bell
              Telephone Laboratories for two years, accepted a one-year visiting faculty position
              with Stanford’s Operations Research Program (OR), and became a member of the
              tenure-line faculty when the OR Program became the Department of Operations Research.
              He talks about his rise through the academic ranks, his collaboration with George
              Dantzig (who had left Berkeley and joined Stanford), the formation of the Mathematical
              and Computational Sciences Program, the anti-Viet Nam War turbulence, his receipt of
              the U.S. Senior Scientist Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, and
              eventual chairmanship of the OR Department. He discusses the merger of the OR
              Department with the Engineering-Economic Systems Department and a second merger four
              years later with the Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering
              Management.</p>
                  <p>The second interview returns to the formation of the OR Department, its nature, its
              chairs, and the contemporaneous deans of the School of Engineering. Cottle recounts
              stories about his own chairmanship (which ended when the first of the two mergers
              occurred) and some of the challenges faced by the department. He also talks about
              events on campus, some of his closest friends on the Stanford faculty, and the effect
              that international recognition for his scholarly work had on his life at Stanford. He
              relates how he became involved with the writing of the book Stanford Street Names and
              other book projects. Responding to interviewer Kandis Scott’s questions, Cottle
              reflects on changes in the university, his sense of the most notable accomplishments
              of his career, and the challenges he faces going forward. The interview closes with
              comments on the influence of his family life.</p>

                  <p>Carl Degler begins with his decision to become a historian and his experience serving
              in the Army Air Force in World War II. He discusses his interests in labor unions,
              women’s history and black history. He continues with his position at Vassar followed
              by how he came to Stanford. The author of numerous books, Degler comments on his
              approach to writing and how he came to write about particular subjects and people in
              history. He concludes with his involvement in NOW (National Organization for Women)
              and his mentorship of women in academia.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Sarah Donaldson begins her interviews by talking about her early life growing up
              in Portland, Oregon in the years during and after WWII. She describes her work during
              high school as a candy striper and nurse’s aide, and her later decision to study
              nursing at the University of Oregon. Dr. Donaldson speaks of her first job working for
              a cancer surgeon named Bill Fletcher who mentored her and ultimately encouraged her to
              go to medical school at a time when very few women were becoming doctors. She
              subsequently attended Dartmouth Medical School for two years and then transferred to
              Harvard for her last two years.</p>
                  <p>Initially, Dr. Donaldson wanted to be a cancer surgeon but changed her mind and
              pursued radiation oncology. She took a residency at Stanford and specialized in
              pediatric radiation oncology when it was not yet a known field. Dr. Donaldson then
              became an assistant professor and set up a pediatric radiation oncology program at
              Stanford. She describes liking the small, family-like department she was in and
              feeling inspired by her colleagues to do her best work. While she enjoys all facets of
              her job, Dr. Donaldson mentioned particularly liking mentoring young female doctors
              and taking care of patients.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Donaldson goes on to describe how many opportunities came to her because there
              were so few women in her field and how she was lacking a female mentor in her early
              years. She concludes the interview by talking about some of her more meaningful awards
              and honors as well as her publications that have had the most impact.</p>

                  <p>Andy Doty was born and raised in upstate New York. He joined the Army Air Corps and
              served in WWII. He came to Stanford in 1963 after working as a newspaper reporter in
              New York State, assistant director of public relations at Johns Hopkins University,
              and science and engineering editor at the University of Michigan. He retired as
              director of community relations in 1993. His tenure coincided with major land
              development issues at Stanford, including the Sand Hill Road project and the SLAC
              project. Doty’s interview sheds light on the interplay between “the (Stanford)
              trustees’ rights to develop their lands to the full extent if they wished and the
              neighbors’ political power to prevent as much expansion as they could.”</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Robert H. Dreisbach, Stanford alumnus (AB Chemistry 1937) and
              Professor of Pharmacology, Emeritus, discusses growing up in Baker, Oregon. He touches
              on his father’s work on the farm, at a creamery, and as a grocer and his mother’s
              beekeeping, and he describes Boy Scout meetings and hiking trips with his troop. He
              discusses his undergraduate days at Stanford from 1933 to 1937, recalling attending
              dances, the El Capitan Eating Club, and serving as the manager of the Stanford
              baseball team. He recalls his chemistry and physics professors and describes how a
              talk at Stanford given by a researcher from the Department of Agriculture awakened his
              interest in pharmacology and helped to convince him to pursue the subject while in
              medical school at the University of Chicago.</p>
                  <p>Dreisbach briefly recounts his experiences during World War II, which included
              working as an instructor at the Stanford Medical School and military service as a ward
              officer at Lovell General Hospital in Fort Devens, Massachusetts and at a hospital in
              the Panama Canal Zone. He describes the Stanford Medical School when it was located in
              San Francisco and provides his recollections of the rationale behind its move to
              campus, including Windsor Cutting’s involvement. He recounts the origins and evolution
              of his work, The Handbook of Poisoning and the way that poison control centers
              embraced the book.</p>
                  <p>Dreisbach describes the expansion of the Pharmacology Department after Avram
              Goldstein arrived from Harvard University to assume its chairmanship and its move to
              the Stanford campus. He remembers Goldstein as a “go-getter” and relates how he
              secured space in the basement of the Stanford Museum for a laboratory. Dreisbach
              explains how concern about smog and air pollution led him to pursue research and
              writing on environmental issues. An avid hiker, he closes the interview, which was
              conducted on the eve of his 100th birthday, by offering advice for longevity--keep
              climbing summits.</p>

                  <p>William S. Eddelman arrived at Stanford in 1958 with undergraduate degrees in zoology
              and pre-med from the University of Reno. After obtaining his master’s degree in 1960
              in Theater, Eddelman spent a year a Cornell University in a doctorate program before
              transferring back to Stanford. In 1965 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study
              theater and costume design in Venice, Italy at the Cini Institute. Upon his return to
              the States he taught for several years at the University of Calgary and returned to
              Stanford in 1970 as an associate professor in the Drama Department, and was later
              promoted to Assistant Professor. Eddelman took emeritus status in 2002, and taught
              until 2005.</p>
                  <p>In this interview Eddelman describes his professional influences, including the
              global perspectives of Professors Wendell Cole and Doug Russell, and working for Dick
              Hay as a designer, and his own world-wide travels and interests. Eddelman references
              his life as a gay man in San Francisco and Stanford in the 1970s and 1980s. Eddelman
              also talks about his interaction with other Drama Department personnel, including
              Charles Lyons, and the substantial changes in the curriculum and degree focus in the
              Drama Department during the 1970s. Various projects Eddelman worked on at Stanford,
              including productions of Orasteia, Gaieties, and Twelfth Night, are described.
              Eddelman talks about his numerous and diverse interests in theater and costume design,
              including involvement with the Museum of Performance and Design in San Francisco,
              leading alumni tours of Venice and the Veneto for the Stanford Alumni Association,
              lecturing on Paris and Wagner, and cataloging his extensive postcard collection
              depicting various costume and design influences.</p>

                  <p>Associate Professor Emeritus. William S. Eddelman has been a set and costume designer
              and a theater historian for more than forty years. At Stanford he has taught a wide
              variety of classes which have ranged from design, theater aesthetics, and musical
              theater to dramatic literature and cultural studies. Recently, he has taught a
              graduate seminar in international theater aesthetics and an undergraduate seminar
              called “Mapping and Wrapping the Body: The Psychology of Clothes.” He has taught
              several classes for Stanford Continuing Studies and in the last two quarters he has
              given classes on "Venice and the Veneto" and "Paris in the Jazz Age." He has co-led a
              tour for Stanford Alumni Travel in the Veneto part of Italy with a focus on Palladian
              Villas, and led a tour to Venice for carnival.</p>
                  <p>As a very active board member of the San Francisco Performing Arts Library and Museum
              (which will be known in the future as the Museum of Performance and Design), Eddelman
              is involved in advising and purchasing materials for the new museum. He continues to
              work on a massive postcard collection that focuses on the history of costume, and is
              structuring a documentation project on the history of the costume and set design work
              at the Prague Quadrennials. Recently he completed a volume of photographs from nearly

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Mark W. Edwards, an emeritus professor in the Department of Classics, spent over two
              decades serving the Stanford community. Edwards influenced numerous undergraduate and
              graduate students at Stanford and at other institutions in the United States and
              Canada. The focus of this two-part interview is the breadth of Edwards’s teaching
              career and the evolution of his research interests, particularly his work related to
              Homer.</p>
                  <p>Edwards’s academic success in classical languages began at his English grammar school
              during his teenage years. He explains how he chose Latin as his major at Bristol
              University and how, a few years later, he returned to Bristol to earn a second honors
              degree in Greek. Edwards pursued a master’s degree soon after, where he worked with
              Thomas Webster of University College London and began studying Homeric formulae. Both
              Webster and Homer proved to be strong influences on Edwards’s future career.</p>
                  <p>After a year in London, Edwards moved to the United States as a Fulbright fellow at
              Princeton University and then accepted his first teaching position at Brown
              University. Edwards describes his impressions of mid-century America, the works of
              literature he covered in his classes, and his experience as a resident chaperone on
              campus. Edwards also discusses how not getting tenure at Brown prompted him to apply
              for a teaching position at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, where he taught for
              another seven years. He draws interesting comparisons between the two countries based
              on his student interactions, and provides more detailed information and examples about
              his work on Homeric formulae that developed over those fourteen years.</p>
                  <p>In the second interview, Edwards describes his years at Stanford as a professor,
              department chair, and researcher. Edwards found many of his former mentors teaching at
              Stanford when he arrived in 1969. He taught a variety of Classics graduate courses and
              non-major undergraduate classes. Edwards also served as department chair for seven
              years. He discusses the highs and lows of the experience and details the two programs
              he was most proud of implementing: the Stanford in Greece program, which subsidized
              student travel in Greece, and the Webster Fund, named in honor of his mentor Thomas
              Webster, which supported the exchange of guest lecturers between Stanford and
              University College London.</p>
                  <p>Over the course of thirty plus years teaching Homer’s work, Edwards widened his
              research to include studying the poet’s type scenes and story patterns. He personally
              appreciated those moments when Homer broke from the pattern and revealed more of
              himself. To share this expertise, Edwards wrote a well-received reader for the general
              public called Homer: Poet of the Iliad. After retiring early from Stanford, Edwards
              accepted an appointment at the University of California, Santa Cruz to teach Homer to
              undergraduates in Greek.</p>
                  <p>Edwards concludes his interview with thoughts about how classics remains relevant in
              modern society. He points to his retirement reading group that recently studied the
              Odyssey. Through vicarious experience, Edwards feels the retirees gained knowledge
              from studying the text and relating it to the experiences they had during and after
              World War II. Edwards remarks that he takes great pleasure in these new interactions
              with classical texts he has studied his entire career.</p>

                  <p>Bradley Efron begins his interview with his decision to come to Stanford and
              continues with the development of statistics as an established academic discipline at
              Stanford. He talks about a number of people who were significant in the field over the
              years. He explains the relationship of statistics to other disciplines and relates how
              some appointments are joint appointments with other departments. For example, Efron
              held a joint appointment in the medical school working with clinical trials. He
              comments on the evolution of statistics along with the evolution of computers from
              mainframe to desktop, and how that enables the research. He also discusses algorithms
              and inferences in relation to statistics and other disciplines, and tools such as
              “bootstrapping.” Then he spends some time talking about his experiences in leadership
              positions on campus as well as his experiences in publishing. He concludes with his
              thoughts about Stanford and how it grew from a “good” university to a “great”
              university.</p>

                  <p>Paul R. Ehrlich begins with his childhood interest in butterflies and the most
              important thing that shaped his academic interests, a summer with the Inuit Eskimos
              and working for the Canadian Northern Insect Survey. He discusses his early contacts
              during his college years that led to his decision to come to Stanford, including the
              importance of environmental and ecological aspects of biology. Throughout the
              interview, Ehrlich mentions numerous people and publications in his field over the
              years. In addition, he talks about the physical environment in the Stanford area as
              well as the academic environment, both of which influenced him to stay for his entire
              career. He also mentions numerous students who have stood out in his mind at Stanford.
              He includes the collaborative relationship with his wife, Anne Ehrlich, who worked
              with him on various projects and publications. In summary, Ehrlich details his
              experiences as a researcher at Stanford and his thoughts on how the intersections of
              academic disciplines serve to benefit the world.</p>

                  <p>In the oral history interviews conducted on July 12 and August 2, 2012, Dr. Edward
              Feigenbaum discussed his early years in the Bay Area, including his time as a
              professor at UC Berkeley and the difficulty he faced in finding the appropriate
              department for his field of interest. He went on to discuss his hiring at Stanford and
              working in the newly formed Computer Science Department. During his early years at
              Stanford Dr. Feigenbaum also oversaw the Computer Center, and in the interviews he
              discussed upgrading Stanford’s computing equipment and working with other departments
              and programs to secure computing equipment for their needs. In discussing the Computer
              Science Department more generally, Dr. Feigenbaum touched on the department’s faculty,
              facilities, and areas of focus, as well as the importance George Forsythe played in
              the early development of the department.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Feigenbaum also discussed his own research, including his work with Joshua
              Lederberg on the DENDRAL project. He compared his own work to that of John McCarthy, a
              colleague both at Stanford and in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and outlined
              his own contributions to the field. Dr. Feigenbaum went on to discuss Stanford
              policies on consulting, students with whom he worked, the President’s Advisory
              Committee on Computer Science, Stanford’s Sponsored Projects Department, and the
              Computer Science Department’s move from Stanford’s College of Humanities and Sciences
              to the College of Engineering.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Stanford alumnus James H. Flippen (MD 1945) recounts family
              stories and the journey that led him to attend medical school at Stanford University.
              He relates details of student life at the Stanford School of Medicine when it was
              located in San Francisco and recalls incidents from his residency at Stanford. He
              briefly describes his fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital where he learned the
              replacement transfusion technique for treating hemolytic anemia of the newborn, which
              he later taught to physicians on the West Coast. He also provides an account of his
              service in the United States Navy when he was assigned to a clinic for treating
              tropical skin diseases located at the Tanforan Race Track in San Bruno,
              California.</p>
                  <p>Flippen describes his work as a private practitioner of pediatrics in Palo Alto and
              his work as a clinical professor in the pediatric cardiology clinic at Stanford. He
              recounts his role in leasing land from Stanford in cooperation with other physicians
              in order to build a cluster of medical offices near Stanford hospital known as the
              Medical Plaza. He describes his work as the regional chairman of the Accident
              Prevention Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics and his advocacy of
              legislation requiring that cars be equipped with seatbelts, that homes have smoke
              detectors, and that teenagers who drove while intoxicated receive stiff penalties. He
              concludes the interview by discussing his determination of the cause of a tragic
              drowning incident, a phenomenon he branded “silent drowning.”</p>

                  <p>This is the first interview in a theme project to explore the role of development
              (fundraising) in Stanford’s journey “from good to great” and in sustaining greatness. </p>
                  <p>In these two interview sessions, Ford begins by describing the post-WWII history of
              development at the university, broken down into eras corresponding to major
              fundraising campaigns: the PACE campaign 1961-1964 (Plan of Action for a Challenging
              Era); the Campaign for Stanford, 1972-1977; the Centennial Campaign, 1985-1991; the
              Campaign for Undergraduate Education, 2000-2005; and the Stanford Challenge,
              2006-2011. He speaks about the different circumstances, priorities, strategies, and
              university presidents and provosts during each campaign, as well as challenges posed
              by adverse events such as student unrest and the indirect cost controversy. Ford
              believes that one key to Stanford’s development success has been its ability, starting
              back in the 1960s, to integrate financial planning, academic planning, and development
              planning. He also discusses the important roles of university trustees, alumni, donors
              and volunteers; obtaining major gifts from non-alumni; increasing the participation
              rate of alumni; non-monetary campaign goals; introducing a focus on class giving; the
              Commission on Undergraduate Education; and corporate and foundation fundraising.</p>
                  <p>Moving on to questions of strategy, Ford discusses the importance of academic
              priorities; the influence of key individuals; components of the Campaign for
              Undergraduate Education; decentralization of the development function to the deans of
              the schools; large matching gifts; endowed graduate fellowships; and the Terman
              Fellows Program to support young faculty. Ford notes that Stanford led the way among
              peer institutions in many aspects of development, but learned from “the Ivys” in other
              aspects. Bringing alumni back to campus for university seminars and taking Stanford
              “on the road” were unique Stanford contributions. Ford also talks about fundraising
              based on intuition versus data; allocating development resources where they could do
              the most good; starting to focus on undergraduate students before they become alumni;
              Stanford Associates; the importance of stewardship; and unexpected gifts.</p>
                  <p>Concerning administration and collaboration, Ford talks about the decision to add
              development officers in the schools “closer to the product;” managing access to
              donors; academic priorities as compared to donor interests; understanding the broader
              implications of a gift; endowment versus expendable funds; and communication with the
              donor community especially as the university grows and changes. Ford stresses the
              importance of a broad range development program, not just one focused on the handful
              of people who can give very large gifts. Looking to the future, he mentions many
              donors’ desires to see Stanford go beyond its traditional mission and speculates that
              fundraising will have a global focus in the future.</p>

                  <p>Robert E. “Bob” Freelen was Vice President for Public Affairs at Stanford from 1983
              to 1992. He has extensive experience in university fundraising, alumni relations, and
              public relations. In this two-part interview, Freelen reflects on his journey through
              Stanford University. </p>
                  <p>He begins by discussing his undergraduate years at Stanford and describing the
              university environment at the time and his involvement with student government. He
              moves on to his time at the Stanford Graduate School of Business to pursue his MBA and
              finish his Reserve Officers’ Training Corps [ROTC] program. Freelen also recounts
              going into the army following graduation, where he worked in the finance corps. He
              then discusses his return to Stanford, working for the PACE campaign [Plan of Action
              for a Challenging Era] to raise funds for the university. He describes his move into
              working for the Stanford Alumni Association and later the issues he dealt with as
              Acting Dean of Students during challenging times. Freelen details his long career as
              the university’s Director of Government Relations, during which he fostered dialogue
              between Stanford, the state and federal governments, and other universities and
              created new policies and coalitions. He describes succeeding Robert M. “Bob”
              Rosenzweig as Vice President for Public Affairs and keeping up relationships with
              media, government, and donors. Freelen concludes the first interview session by
              discussing relations with the Hoover Institution under director W. Glenn Campbell and
              issues surrounding the proposed construction of the Reagan Library on Stanford
              campus.</p>
                  <p>In the second interview session, Freelen discusses his work in university
              communications and developing a strategic plan for that department. He returns to
              discussing government relations, covering issues including Stanford’s land endowment,
              obtaining anti-trespassing legislation barring Theodore Streleski from campus, and the
              indirect costs controversy. Freelen ends his interview describing his retirement and
              offers his perspective on Stanford today.</p>

                  <p>Theodore “Ted” H. Geballe begins his interviews by discussing his early life in San
              Francisco and his family. He continues on to his time as an undergraduate and graduate
              student at University of California, Berkeley, and the formative experience of working
              with William Giauque. He discusses his career at Bell Labs, including influential
              colleagues he worked with as well as his time studying semi- and superconductors. He
              speaks of his recruitment to Stanford by Marvin Chodorow and the motivations for
              accepting his position. Geballe goes on to discuss the history of Applied Physics and
              its growth during his time in the department. He notes his contributions to the
              department, including his role as department chair, in recruiting other top faculty,
              and in cultivating interdisciplinary research. He discusses his teaching, noting his
              work with Mac Beasley on the research group Ted-Mac Amateur Hour and later with Aharon
              Kapitulnik and Beasley on the research group KGB. </p>
                  <p>Geballe also discusses Stanford’s reputation, the growth of independent labs at
              Stanford, and Applied Physics’ relationship with the Department of Physics and the
              Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. He goes on to discuss his time as director of the
              Center for Materials Research, the development of materials science research at
              Stanford, and his research accomplishments while at Stanford. He also discusses the
              evolution of superconductivity research, and discusses his business venture Conductus.
              Ted Geballe concludes the interview by discussing recent development of lab space
              devoted to materials research at Stanford, including the Geballe Lab for Advanced
              Materials, named in his honor.</p>

                  <p>Albert Joseph Gelpi opens his interview with discussing his family and his upbringing
              in New Orleans. He recounts his time at Loyola and Tulane, and his doctoral work at
              Harvard, where he met Barbara Charlesworth. He discusses marrying Barbara, and
              accepting a position at Stanford in 1967. Gelpi notes Barbara’s difficulties with
              maintaining a university position and raising a family. Gelpi discusses the unrest on
              campus in the late 1960s, and its impact on the English Department. He goes on to
              discuss colleagues in the department as well as department culture. He outlines the
              courses he taught, changes in English curriculum, and his experience as department
              chair. He also notes Barbara’s struggles in the department. He discusses his role in
              creating the American Studies program.</p>
                  <p>The second session starts with Gelpi exploring his time as Associate Dean of Graduate
              Studies and Research, taking time to discuss the development of the Humanities Center.
              He notes the benefits and challenges of working as an associate dean, as well as major
              issues he dealt with. The interview shifts to Gelpi’s own research, including his work
              on Emily Dickinson, The Tenth Muse, A Coherent Splendor, American Poetry After
              Modernism: The Power of the Word, his time editing Cambridge Studies in American
              Literature and Culture, his work with Adrienne Rich, and his work on C. Day Lewis.
              Gelpi notes his involvement in Stanford’s Catholic community, and discusses his
              retirement and thoughts on changes at Stanford since his arrival.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Albert Joseph Gelpi was born on July 19, 1931 in New Orleans, where he attended
              Jesuit High School and got his A. B. from Loyola University, New Orleans. After
              serving in the U. S. Army (1951-53, the last year in Korea), he got his M. A. from
              Tulane and taught briefly at Loyola before starting doctoral studies at Harvard in
              fall, 1957. He received his PhD from Harvard in 1962 with a dissertation on Emily
              Dickinson under the supervision of Perry Miller. While teaching there as an assistant
              professor for the next six years, he married Barbara Charlesworth in 1965, and they
              had two children: Christopher (b. 1966) and Adrienne (b. 1970). In 1965 his
              dissertation was published by Harvard University Press under the title Emily
              Dickinson: The Mind of the Poet.</p>
                  <p>In the fall of 1968 the Gelpis came to Stanford with Albert as a tenured associate
              professor and Barbara as a lecturer. During the thirty-plus years on the Stanford
              teaching faculty, Gelpi offered a range of courses in American literature on the
              undergraduate and graduate levels, earning him a Dean’s Teaching Award shortly before
              his full retirement in 2002. He was Guggenheim Fellow, 1977-78, and became the William
              Robertson Coe Professor of American Literature in 1979. Besides teaching, Gelpi served
              in a number of administrative post within the department, including Chair (1985-88),
              and in the University, including several stints as Chair of the American Studies
              Program (1976-77, 1989-90, 1994-7), and as Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and
              Research (1980-85). He was the founding editor of the influential monograph series
              “Cambridge Studies in American Literature and Culture,” published by Cambridge
              University Press, and served in that capacity from 1980 to 1991.</p>
                  <p>Gelpi’s primary field of scholarly and critical interest is American poetry, and, in
              addition to many journal articles and essays in collections, he has written, besides
              the Dickinson book, a three volume study of the development of an American poetic
              tradition from the Puritans through the twentieth century: The Tenth Muse: The Psyche
              of the American Poet (1975, reissued, 1991); A Coherent Splendor: The American Poetic
              Renaissance 1910-1950 (1987); and American Poetry After Modernism: The Power of the
              Word ( forthcoming, 2015).</p>
                  <p>He has also edited a number of important books in the field of American poetry: The
              Poet in America 1650 to the Present (1973); (with Barbara Charlesworth Gelpi) Adrienne
              Rich’s Poetry (1973) and Adrienne Rich’s Poetry and Prose (1992); Wallace Stevens: The
              Poetics of Modernism (1986); Denise Levertov: Selected Criticism (1993); The Blood of
              the Poet: Selected Poems of William Everson (1994); (with Jacqueline Brogan) A Whole
              New Poetry Beginning Here: Adrienne Rich in the Eighties &amp; Nineties (1998); The
              Wild God of the World: An Anthology of Robinson Jeffers (2003); Dark God of Eros: A
              William Everson Reader (2003), and (with Robert Bertholf) The Letters of Robert Duncan
              &amp; Denise Levertov (2003), which won an award from the Modern Language Association
              in 2004 as the best scholarly edition.</p>
                  <p>In 1993 he published Living in Time: The Poetry of C. Day-Lewis, and is planning,
              with Bernard O’Donoghue, a Selected Prose of C. Day-Lewis.</p>
                  <p>Gelpi continues to teach from time to time in Stanford Continuing Studies and in its
              Master of Liberal Arts Program.</p>

                  <p>Barbara Charlesworth Gelpi begins her interview discussing her early life in
              Colombia, her parents and her sister, her education in catholic schools in Colombia
              and Toronto, Canada, as well as her undergraduate and graduate work at the University
              of Miami. Gelpi goes on to discuss her doctoral work at Radcliffe and meeting Albert
              Gelpi. She notes her positions at University of California, Santa Barbara, Brandies,
              and marrying Albert, who accepted a position in 1967 at Stanford. Gelpi discusses the
              unrest on campus at the time and her experience as a woman and a lecturer in
              Stanford’s English Department. Gelpi notes the difficulty she faced getting a regular
              appointment at Stanford, and her experience at San Jose State. She recounts her work
              with other female faculty in developing interdisciplinary courses and texts dealing
              with women, and the founding of the Center for Research on Women (CROW).</p>
                  <p>Gelpi opens the second session discussing at length her experience as editor of
              Signs, including its influence and reception. She also discusses other Stanford
              faculty and staff who assisted with Signs and the challenges they all faced in editing
              the journal. Gelpi further explores her experience as a woman and a spouse of a
              faculty member in the English Department, and how she dealt with changing societal
              norms. She recounts her efforts to get a tenure track position and eventually tenure
              within the department. She concludes by discussing her time as interim director at the
              Clayman Institute and thoughts on Stanford’s evolution since her arrival.</p>

                  <p>Barbara Charlesworth was born of Canadian parents in a Colombian oil camp named El
              Centro. She had her primary education in the one-room schoolhouse there and spent her
              middle and high school years at Loretto Abbey, Toronto. After receiving a summa cum
              laude B.A. (1955) and an M.A. (1957) in English from the University of Miami,
              Charlesworth entered Radcliffe College in 1957. (At that time, both the undergraduate
              and the graduate women students at Radcliffe took all their courses at Harvard and
              fulfilled all of Harvard’s requirements but still were awarded a Radcliffe, not a
              Harvard, degree.) When she received her Ph.D. in 1962, her dissertation, entitled Dark
              Passages: The Decadent Consciousness in Victorian Literature, received the Howard
              Mumford Jones award as the year’s best in the fields of British and American
              Literature and was published in 1965 by the Wisconsin University Press.</p>
                  <p>After two years (1962-64) as an assistant professor at the University of California,
              Santa Barbara, Charlesworth returned east in 1964 to join the faculty at Brandeis. She
              married Albert Gelpi, then an assistant professor at Harvard, in 1965. Two years
              later, after the birth in 1966 of the Gelpis’ first child, Christopher, Gelpi resigned
              her Brandeis position, and when Albert Gelpi accepted a tenured post at Stanford in
              1968, she also joined the department as a part-time lecturer. The couple’s second
              child, Adrienne, was born in 1970.</p>
                  <p>Beginning in the early 1970s Gelpi was in the vanguard of the burgeoning field of
              feminist literary criticism. With Albert Gelpi she edited Adrienne Rich’s Poetry,
              published by W.W. Norton in 1975, and in 1977 was one of an interdisciplinary group
              which studied the life cycle of Victorian women, work that culminated in Victorian
              Women: A Documentary Account of Women’s Lives in Nineteenth Century England, France,
              and the United States, published by the Stanford University Press in 1981. Meanwhile,
              in 1980 when the University of Chicago Press chose Stanford’s newly established Center
              for Research on Women (CROW) to house Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society,
              Gelpi, with an interdisciplinary team of Stanford associates, became its editor, a
              post she held until 1985.</p>
                  <p>Gelpi, who had continued in her part-time lectureship in English through these years,
              joined the English Department as a half-time untenured associate professor in 1982,
              and became a tenured professor in 1992, the same year that she published Shelley’s
              Goddess: Maternity, Language, Subjectivity with Oxford University Press. She won the
              Lillian and Thomas B. Rhodes Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching in 1993.
              As chair of the department’s technology committee she was one of the pioneers in
              bringing technology into liberal arts class rooms and in 1996 was given a Bing
              Technology Grant for graduate student training. In 2002-4 she served as Acting
              Director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender and then retired from
              Stanford. Her recent scholarship centers on the Oxford Movement in nineteenth-century
              England.</p>

                  <p>In his first interview, James Gibbons talked about his impressions of Stanford since
              arriving in 1953; the turbulence on campus in the late 1960s and the erosion of trust
              between faculty &amp; students; creative problem solving and stories about Bill
              Shockley, his idea of teaching as coaching and seeing things differently. He also
              discussed fundamental physics research versus engineering development of advanced
              technology, the move of the Computer Science Department from the School of Humanities
              and Sciences, Don Knuth, and the major role of the School of Engineering in almost all
              Stanford academic &amp; industrial partnerships.</p>
                  <p>In his second interview, James Gibbons discussed SERA Solar Cell Corporation and the
              background of solar cell research, his research into silicon films and new
              photovoltaic technology, the value of connections to the semiconductor industry, the
              importance of Stanford University as an entrepreneurial place, and Tutored Video
              Instruction (TVI).</p>
                  <p>In his third interview, James Gibbons discussed TVI further, its valuable uses beyond
              Stanford and comparison to the new approach of “massively open online courses.”
              Gibbons also gave his advice to today’s students and discussed multidisciplinary
              research, the successes of two-party collaborations, the Center for Integrated Systems
              (CIS), and fundraising. He reflected on John Linvill, past Stanford presidents, and
              his endeavors as the Dean of Engineering.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Professor Gibbons received a BS degree at Northwestern University in 1953 and a PhD
              from Stanford in 1956. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1957, was appointed professor
              of electrical engineering in 1964, and dean of the School of Engineering in 1984. In
              1983 he was named Reid Weaver Dennis Professor of Electrical Engineering, and in 1984
              the Frederick Emmons Terman Dean of the School of Engineering. He served as Dean from
              September 1984 to June 1996.</p>
                  <p>His principal research interests are in the fields of semiconductor device analysis,
              process physics and technology and solar energy. He is the author of four textbooks in
              semiconductor electronics, four research monographs in the fields of ion implantation
              and beam processing of semiconductors and over 250 papers. He received the IEEE Jack
              A. Morton Award (1980), the Texas Instruments Founder's Prize (1982), the
              Semiconductor Industry Association's University Research Award (1996), and the
              American Electronics Association Medal of Achievement (1996) for his pioneering
              research in the use of ion implantation and rapid thermal processing techniques for
              solid-state physics and technology.</p>
                  <p>In 1972, he invented the Tutored Video Instruction process, which he and his
              colleagues at Stanford and Hewlett-Packard developed into a highly regarded model for
              video-based distance learning, first used for the in-plant education of engineers in
              industry. He was awarded the IEEE Medal of Education (1981) for this work and for his
              semiconductor texts. Upon leaving the dean's office in 1996, Gibbons founded SERA
              Learning Technologies, a company devoted to using tutored video instruction for the
              education of at risk and underserved youth.</p>
                  <p>As dean, he created several important interschool programs with the School of
              Humanities and Sciences, the Graduate School of Business and the School of Medicine.
              In 1986, he brought the computer science department into the School of Engineering and
              initiated the thorough integration of that discipline into the departments and
              research centers of the School, an activity that has been continued and amplified by
              his successors. He also engaged venture capitalists in helping to build the school's
              endowment, through the Engineering Venture Fund, and to create new educational
              opportunities for students through the Technology Ventures Program.</p>
                  <p>Starting in 1985, he worked with the President and a group of senior colleagues in
              the university administration to create a plan for the Science and Engineering Quad,
              and he contributed to its implementation by raising naming gifts and supporting funds
              for several buildings in the SEQ. Within the school, he worked with the department
              chairs to put in place new standards for tenure that included high quality in both
              teaching and research, leading to a new plateau in the national ranking of the school.
              Upon his retirement from the office of dean, the University named a grove of trees
              outside the Thornton Center for him. A marker in that grove carries the inscription:
              "His enormous contributions as teacher, scholar, entrepreneur and dean have changed
              forever the physical and intellectual landscape of Stanford and the School of
              Engineering. His visionary leadership has set us on a course of unparalleled
              excellence and ensured the preeminence of our endeavors for generations to come."</p>

                  <p>In this 2015 oral history interview, anthropologist James Lowell Gibbs Jr. discusses
              his early life and education, his fieldwork in Liberia, teaching anthropology to
              undergraduates, and his service as Stanford University’s first dean of undergraduate
              studies.</p>
                  <p>Gibbs describes his family background and credits the book African Journey by Eslanda
              Goode Robeson with sparking his interest in anthropology. He discusses his
              undergraduate education at Cornell University, especially conducting social science
              research on intergroup relations as an undergraduate--an experience that would later
              inform his ideas about undergraduate education as a Stanford administrator. He speaks
              of the Rotary Foundation Fellowship that allowed him to study anthropology at
              Cambridge for a year and discusses his graduate education at Harvard, where he learned
              from Cora Du Bois and others.</p>
                  <p>Shifting to his research, Gibbs describes the circumstances that led him to focus on
              tribal law among the Kpelle people of Liberia and relates memories of his field work
              there, including the making of the prize-winning film, The Cows of Dolo Kenpaye.</p>
                  <p>Gibbs recounts his rationale for moving from the University of Minnesota to Stanford
              in 1966. He describes the founding of the Program in African and Afro-American Studies
              and the recruitment of St. Clair Drake to direct the program. He recalls some of the
              work that he did as Stanford’s first dean of undergraduate studies, and he discusses
              his tenure a chair of the Department of Anthropology and the split of the department
              that occurred in the late 1990s.</p>
                  <p>Gibbs also discusses his efforts to recruit minority faculty and his work with
              student-initiated programs such as SWOPSI (Student Workshop on Political and Social
              Improvement) and SCIRE (Student Center for Innovation in Research and Education). He
              concludes by commenting on vivid Stanford memories and some of the board positions he
              has held.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>William Gilly is a biology professor at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station whose
              research has contributed to our basic understanding of electrical excitability in
              nerve and muscle cells in a wide variety of organisms ranging from brittle stars to
              mammals. In this interview, Gilly discusses the path his science career has taken,
              including measuring gas diffusion across membranes, patch clamping giant squid
              neurons, and retracing John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts’s expedition to the Sea of
              Cortez. Beyond his research, he explains how he has incorporated exploration and
              discovery into his courses and science outreach.</p>
                  <p>Gilly begins the interview with his affinity for Uncle Wiggly, an aged but
              adventurous rabbit from a series of children’s stories, and describes his own
              independent forays into the natural surroundings of Allentown, Pennsylvania when he
              was a child. He explains his family’s technical background and how his interest in ham
              radio led him to pursue an electrical engineering degree at Princeton.</p>
                  <p>Gilly details the independent undergraduate research project that landed him in a
              neurophysiology lab, shifted his focus to biology, and, despite inconclusive results,
              earned him an award from his engineering department. He describes his acceptance to
              the PhD program at Washington University in St. Louis and how, when his advisor died
              suddenly, a network of friends and acquaintances from Yale University, the Marine
              Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, and the University of Washington’s Friday Harbor
              Laboratories enabled him to complete his research and thesis in physiology and
              biophysics and to begin a postdoctoral fellowship in Clara Franzini-Armstrong’s lab at
              the University of Pennsylvania, studying the role of ion channels in electrical
              signaling in squid axons.</p>
                  <p>This expertise, Gilly explains, resulted in his appointment at Stanford, working at
              Hopkins Marine Station where he could collect squid specimens directly from the bay.
              Citing his experiences both as a scientist and fisherman, he opines on the ways that
              the Monterey Bay has and has not recovered. After discussing the bureaucratic
              challenges of achieving tenure, he launches into stories about the classes he has
              taught, including a technical training course on patch clamping squid neurons, a
              holistic biology class that involved field research in Baja California Big Sur and the
              Salinas River, and the Steinbeck Summer Institutes program for primary educators.</p>
                  <p>A central text to many of these courses is Steinbeck and Ricketts’s Sea of Cortez: A
              Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research, and Gilly discusses how he and several
              colleagues organized their own expedition based on Steinbeck and Ricketts’s sea
              voyage. He details preparations and sponsorship for the trip and mentions how the
              original expedition’s ship, the Western Flyer, is being restored for outreach and
              possible future trips.</p>
                  <p>Gilly talks about his other outreach work, including donating giant squid to primary
              classrooms for his Squid4Kids program, trying to mount a critter-cam on a squid for
              National Geographic TV, and serving as a National Geographic Expert on their Lindblad
              cruises in the Sea of Cortez. He concludes the interview by discussing his current
              project helping to set up a community-run marine lab in Santa Rosalía, Baja California
              Sur, Mexico and how it might be used for environmental research and education.</p>

                  <p>In this multi-part oral history, David A. Hamburg told much of his life story,
              beginning with his family background. The first interview included stories of his
              family background and the educational experiences of his father, as well as his own.
              He then went on to tell a little about his military training and service during WWII,
              followed by a move to medical practice and research after his service ended. This
              interview also covered his life in Chicago, involvement with NIMH, and the move to
              Stanford. The second interview continued with descriptions of the research done at
              Stanford and the research culture, the development of the Human Biology Department,
              the evolution of the Psychiatry Department, and NIH intramural programs. Hamburg also
              described his friendship with Wallace Sterling, his participation in Stanford
              leadership and campus service, and the protests of the 1960s and 1970s. This interview
              concluded with a preliminary look at the Primate Research Lab.</p>
                  <p>Parts three and four of the interviews focused mostly on Stanford’s Primate Research
              Lab on campus and the research stations in Africa. Hamburg also offered his take on
              Jane Goodall, and described the Gombe Stream Kidnapping in detail. The final interview
              explained why Hamburg left Stanford in 1975. In the conversation, Hamburg also spoke
              of his work on the Stanford Board of Trustees, his role in the selection of President
              Richard W. Lyman, and his take on the Donald Kennedy presidency. Finally, he spoke
              about his participation in Board of Trustees committees and the establishment of the
              Cancer Institute on campus.</p>

                  <p>There are two tremendously meaningful threads in G. Robert Hamrdla’s career at
              Stanford, beginning as a student and continuing to this day. They are: (1) Hamrdla’s
              overseas experience in Germany (only the second group of students to participate in
              the Bing Overseas Studies Program) was a transformative experience for him, leading
              him to an extended and extensive role in the program; (2) Hamrdla's love for students
              and the guidance, assistance and counseling he provided to many, many students over
              the years. He was the first director of the Academic Information Center and was a
              central force in its development. He has an insider’s view of the presidencies of
              Richard Lyman and Donald Kennedy.</p>

                  <p>In the oral history interviews conducted on September 26 and October 18, 2012, Dr.
              Van Harvey discussed his early life and education, noting the religious teachings of
              his upbringing and addressing his eventual shift away from a theological approach to
              religion to a critical approach. The nature of religious studies itself was also
              evolving during this time, as Dr. Harvey noted while discussing positions he held at
              Princeton, Southern Methodist University, and University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Harvey
              was eventually approached by Bill Clebsch to take a position in the Religious Studies
              Department at Stanford. Harvey accepted, starting at Stanford in 1978. Harvey
              discussed his colleagues in Religious Studies, the formation of the George Edwin
              Burnell endowed professorship, the formation of Jewish Studies, serving as chair for
              the department, building the graduate program, and the classes he taught.</p>
                  <p>Harvey also discussed his time as a fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center, student
              culture at Stanford, and changes in the Stanford’s Western Culture curriculum
              (including the shift from Western Culture to Cultures, Ideas, and Values [CIV]).
              Harvey went on to his work in the Stanford Commission on Investment Responsibility and
              the Committee of Academic Appraisal and Achievement. He commented on the formation of
              the Humanities and Sciences Faculty Council and the controversy of the Hoover
              Institution and the proposed Reagan Library. The interview shifted to a discussion of
              Harvey’s work on Ludwig Feuerbach and his book The Historian and the Believer, and
              ended with Harvey’s award and accomplishments.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Van Austin Harvey, George Edwin Burnell Professor of Religious Studies Emeritus,
              was born in Hankow, China, to parents serving as missionaries. The family return to
              the United States in 1929 and settled in Merced, where Dr. Harvey grew up. He served
              in the United States Navy during World War II before attending Occidental College,
              where he obtained a BA in Philosophy. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary
              for a year, received a B.D. from Yale Divinity School, and a Ph.D. from Yale in
              post-Enlightenment religious thought.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Harvey has taught at Princeton University, Perkins School of Theology at Southern
              Methodist University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Stanford University. At Penn
              and Stanford he was chair of his departments. Dr. Harvey’s research and writings
              examine the meaning of terms used in theology and the way in which “morality of
              knowledge” informs professional historical examination and creates problems for
              believers and theologians who wish to justify the historical claims of Christianity on
              faith alone. In particular, the historical examinations of Jesus of Nazareth create
              struggles between historical record and faith. Dr. Harvey argues that modern Christian
              theologians have not yet provided satisfactory evidence to reconcile the
              struggles.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Harvey has published many works, from articles to book reviews to books
              themselves (notably A Handbook of Theological Terms (1964) and The Historian and the
              Believer (1966)). He received an honorary degree in the Humanities from Occidental
              College, two John Simon Guggenheim Fellowships, a National Endowment of the Humanities
              Fellowship, a Visiting Fellowship from Clare Hall at Cambridge University, and
              multiple distinguished teaching awards.</p>

                  <p>Marvin L. Herrington, a native of Detroit, Michigan, served as the Chief of Police at
              Stanford University for over thirty years. After finishing his military service in the
              1950s, Mr. Herrington got a job as a police officer in Holly, Michigan, and eventually
              switched to working in law enforcement on university campuses. His work at Stanford
              between 1971 and 2002 coincided with much of the student unrest related to the Vietnam
              War, and the state of the Stanford Department of Public Safety when he began there
              required him and his colleagues to create policies and work closely with
              administration, local community, and other local law enforcement bodies. During
              Herrington’s tenure, Stanford transformed from a community roiling with student
              protests (many of which caused physical damage to University buildings) to a calmer
              campus, though it still poses challenges. Herrington has noted that the constant
              difficulty of policing a college campus is that most of the population turns over
              every four years, and a university of Stanford’s prestige naturally attracts VIP
              students, world dignitaries, and large cultural and sports events. Herrington’s
              overarching policy has been to approach each situation and each offender equally, no
              matter the status. In a Stanford Report article in 2001, Herrington’s approach was
              described as “no-nonsense but non-confrontational.”</p>

                  <p>Halsted Holman was born in San Francisco to two Stanford Medicine professors. He was
              the first chairman of the Department of Medicine when the school moved from San
              Francisco to Palo Alto. He spearheaded staffing the new department and was given ample
              funding and space. At this time, academic medicine was transitioning from a clinical
              focus to a research base, so many of the hires Holman made were young men like
              himself. Holman was also politically active and blacklisted during the McCarthy era
              for his organizing work, primarily with student organizations on the East Coast and in
              Europe. He developed an interest in patient self-care and medical education and
              directed the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar Training Program from
              1969 (its inception) to 1996. During the interview, Holman described both his
              professional and political activities</p>

                  <p>Charlotte Jacobs begins her interviews by discussing her happy childhood in a large
              family in Tennessee, and the pressure she felt being a young girl in the 1950s with
              dreams of being a doctor. She goes on to detail the influence of Jonas Salk’s polio
              vaccine trials, of which she was a part, and several other important milestones that
              empowered her to follow her dreams into medicine. She describes her journey from
              pre-med undergrad at the University of Rochester to post-doctoral fellow in oncology
              at Stanford University, under the supervision of Saul Rosenberg. She credits much of
              her success to this esteemed oncologist, under whom she could achieve her goal of
              succeeding in clinical research and patient care. </p>
                  <p>Jacobs paints a vivid picture of her career from start to finish. She broke the mold
              as an acting assistant professor at Stanford, teaching second year medical students
              and designing and leading the new Oncology Day Care Center. She also led pioneering
              work into the “organ preservation approach” with mentors and colleagues Willard Fee
              and Dan Goffinet, changing forever the paradigm of head and neck cancer. In the
              meantime, she achieved a true balance between a fulfilling family life and a
              high-flying medical career. </p>
                  <p>Jacobs continues to detail the trajectory of her career, including her rise from
              acting assistant professor to senior associate dean. Despite it taking Jacobs almost
              two decades to reach tenure, she was named the “Drs. Ben and A. Jess Shenson Professor
              of Medicine,” and was given total academic freedom to continue accomplishing her
              professional goals. Jacobs then discusses her innovative teaching at the university,
              the awards she received, and the students whom she inspired and who inspired her. She
              tells at length of her rewarding role in revamping the education of Stanford’s medical
              students as Senior Associate Dean of Education and Student Affairs, which began a
              wonderful part of her career working with David Korn and Robert Cutler, as well as
              continuing her work as a general oncologist. Following this, she led the creation of a
              new multidisciplinary cancer center at Stanford. Jacobs then became the director of
              the Clinical Cancer Program for UCSF Stanford Health Care as part of the two
              universities’ merging efforts. Jacobs depicts how this merger caused much friction as
              well as success.</p>
                  <p>Jacobs then tells of opening the clinical cancer center after which she returned to
              clinical research and patient care. She discusses her building of the sarcoma and lung
              cancer programs, mentoring young faculty and women professionals, and her choice to
              take early retirement so she could divide her time between treating veterans with
              cancer and writing. </p>
                  <p>Jacobs then details finding the time to finish her book on Henry Kaplan, a
              biography–the genre she most loved reading as a child–that she had spent years on
              already. She goes into great detail about learning the craft and how writing her first
              and second books (a biography of Jonas Salk) has helped her as a doctor and medical
              professional. She also discusses the importance of the theatre, particularly musical
              theatre, in her life, both as a young woman and throughout her time as a mother,
              doctor, and professor. She credits these passions with helping her profoundly as a
              physician, allowing her to better understand the needs and anxieties of patients, and
              to better deal with the complexities of being a doctor.</p>
                  <p>Jacobs, throughout the interviews, draws on the importance of patients in her life
              and work, and she describes those who have inspired her and fascinated her, and
              imagines what her memoir might look like if she ever completes it. She outlines her
              keys to success in the scientific sphere, and specifically the skills and attributes
              she believes make a wonderful, caring doctor. She credits her work-life balance and
              her constant wish to care for those in need as her main focuses throughout her stellar
              career. Finally, Jacobs considers what could be seen as her legacy: her pioneering
              work in the field of head and neck cancer, the clinical cancer center at Stanford, her
              pride in her students at the university and those whom she taught and for whom she
              became a role model, and mostly, the patients whom she cured or helped to face the
              prospect of death. She explains that patients are what drove her career from the very
              beginning, and still do, and that she hopes she has made life better for all of
              them.</p>

                  <p>Oleg Jardetzky, professor emeritus of molecular pharmacology at Stanford University
              School of Medicine and former director of the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory,
              discusses his role in the establishment and maturation of the field of medical and
              biological nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). He also recalls the circumstances that
              led him from Yugoslavia to the United States and his historical research into his
              family’s genealogy.</p>
                  <p>He begins the interview explaining how his parents, Russian émigrés, left Yugoslavia
              for Austria after World War II and the scholarship that brought him to Macalester
              College in Minnesota. From there he describes his medical and PhD education at the
              University of Minnesota and his involvement with early NMR protein structure research.
              He traces his professional track from Minnesota to Caltech to Harvard Medical School
              to executive positions in industry at Merck Therapeutic Research. He explains how he
              started the first biological and medical NMR laboratory at Harvard, describing the
              lab’s funding and how isotopic substitution was used to determine molecular
              structures.</p>
                  <p>Jardetzky gives a detailed account of his first turbulent years in the Pharmacology
              Department at Stanford University School of Medicine and offers insights into the
              department’s politics at the time. He describes the initial equipment built for the
              Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and how the university used it. </p>
                  <p>Finally, he ruminates on how his interest in his family’s history led him to
              genealogy research and the publishing of two books on Polish clans and Russian
              emigration.</p>

                  <p>David’s most enduring contributions to the field of design are a human-centered
              methodology and culture of innovation. More recently, he led the creation of the
              groundbreaking d.school at Stanford, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design. Kelley
              was working (unhappily) as an electrical engineer when he first heard about Stanford’s
              cross-disciplinary Joint Program in Design, which merged engineering and art. What he
              learned there—a human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems
              through design—propelled his professional life as a “design thinker.”</p>
                  <p>In 1978, David co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO. Today, he
              serves as chair of IDEO and is the Donald W. Whittier Professor at Stanford, where he
              has taught for more than 25 years. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned
              David the Sir Misha Black Medal for his “distinguished contribution to design
              education.” He has also won the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation, as well as
              the Chrysler Design Award and National Design Award in Product Design from the
              Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and he is a member of the National
              Academy of Engineers.</p>

                  <p>In his interview, Michael W. Kirst discussed his more than forty years of work in
              national, state, local and academic issues in education. He looked at the problems he
              has seen in California’s education system, his work as president of the State Board of
              Education both in the late 1970s and since 2011, and his role at Stanford in shaping
              the School of Education which has recently been renamed the Stanford Graduate School
              of Education, and some of its courses. Kirst also talks about the problems of
              training, hiring and firing teachers, and whether early teacher tenure (for example,
              after two years of teaching) is a good idea. The union influence is strong, he
              noted.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Helena Kraemer begins with stories about how her family background
              played an important role in motivating her to achieve college and career goals in math
              and statistics, an uncommon aspiration for women of her era. She talks about how she
              landed at Stanford and goes on to review her personal and professional life there,
              highlighting her accomplishments as a female statistician within the university’s
              School of Medicine. She relays many stories about her work and professional
              relationships in the Department of Psychiatry and speaks about how different
              department heads affected her career advancement. While she faced obstacles to tenure
              as a female in a predominantly male department, she overcame those obstacles through
              perseverance, high-quality research respected by peers, and sheer determination. As a
              co-author or contributor to literally hundreds of research articles, she speaks of one
              of her proudest accomplishment as the work she did on the latest edition of the
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychological Disorders. Toward the end of the
              interview, she talks about the challenge of trying to balance family needs and career
              goals throughout her years at the university. Nevertheless, in looking back at her
              family and career, she would do it all again, having found great satisfaction in the
              research and teaching contributions she made while at Stanford and in raising two
              accomplished daughters.</p>

                  <p>Charles H. Kruger is professor emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering
              at Stanford University. Kruger is an internationally recognized researcher of physical
              gas dynamics, partially ionized plasmas, plasma chemistry, and plasma diagnostics. He
              is also highly regarded for his transformational leadership as an administrator,
              having spent half his Stanford career in senior administrative positions, including
              Vice Provost and Dean of Research and Graduate Policy (1993-2003). </p>
                  <p>In the first interview, Kruger describes growing up in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
              rebuilding a Model A Ford while in high school, and his early interests in mechanical
              engineering. He relates his undergraduate experiences at the University of Oklahoma
              and at MIT, where he gained laboratory experience and was awarded a fellowship from
              the National Science Foundation. Kruger recounts his decision to use the fellowship at
              the Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology in London where he was exposed to the
              field of biology, built his first computer, and developed his interest in fluid
              mechanics and thermal dynamics. Kruger, explains his decision to pursue his PhD at
              MIT, his thesis on the axial-flow compressor in the free-molecule range, and his
              transition from being an assistant professor at MIT to working for Lockheed. </p>
                  <p>Kruger relates the series of events that led him to join Stanford as an assistant
              professor in mechanical engineering in 1962. He depicts the state of the university
              and the Mechanical Engineering Department at the time and explains his research in
              magentohydrodynamics in the High Temperature Gasdynamics Laboratory. He goes on to
              discuss teaching and working with students from a variety of backgrounds and
              emphasizes the value in learning to tackle new problems in new ways. Kruger speaks
              about the issue of having defense research on campus and his own research on air
              pollution.</p>
                  <p>In the next interview, Kruger talks about preparing the textbooks, Introduction to
              Physical Gas Dynamics with Walter G. Vincenti and Partially Ionized Gases with Morton
              Mitchner. He delves deeper into his inter-departmental collaborations, including his
              research with Richard Zare in the Chemistry Department. While serving as department
              chair of Mechanical Engineering from 1982 to 1988, he describes encouraging
              interaction between the divisions, dissolving the nuclear engineering program, and the
              evolution of the design division. Kruger also points to his involvement with air
              pollution as a discipline and experience on the hearing board of the Bay Area Air
              Pollution Control District. He explains how serving as senior associate dean of
              engineering led him to realize the importance of undergraduate teaching to the success
              of the university. Kruger alludes to the story of David Kelley, the founder of the D
              School, and his track to tenure at Stanford. He also briefly describes serving as
              chair of the Faculty Senate from 1990 to 1991 and the challenges he tackled, including
              the indirect cost crisis. </p>
                  <p>In the third and final interview, Kruger speaks of becoming Dean of Research and
              Graduate Policy in 1993, encouraging undergraduate research, and promoting
              collaboration between departments with the Graduate Fellowship Program. He describes
              the change within the administration at the time, working with the Office of
              Technology Licensing, and managing issues regarding federal funding. He then delves
              into the early stages of the Bio-X program when he worked with John Hennessy and
              others to bolster interaction between the Medical School and other parts of the
              university. The James H. Clark Center was one of the products of their efforts. Kruger
              concludes his interview with a discussion of the future directions of training and
              education, his experience running Bio-X after becoming emeriti faculty, and the
              overall strengthening of Stanford.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Mark C. Lawrence, Chief Engineer at Stanford’s radio station
              KZSU for over fifty years, describes growing up in Gridley, California, his physician
              father’s purchase of a farm, his experience working with farm machinery, and how that
              experience led to a lifetime of building things with his hands and to an interest in
              radio. He recalls how that interest led him to volunteer at KZSU when he arrived at
              Stanford as a freshman in 1963 and eventually to work as its Chief Engineer to this
              day.</p>
                  <p>Lawrence recounts the history of KZSU, its gradual expansion, the development of its
              physical facilities, and its broadening areas of interest. He discusses how the focus
              of the Department of Electrical Engineering shifted from radio electronics to
              computing and the subsequent impact on the station. He recalls his employment at the
              Carnegie Institution of Washington Department of Plant Biology on the Stanford campus
              after his graduation, taking the first two undergraduate computer science courses in
              the 1960s, and working eventually in the Computer Center from 1972 to 2004 when he was
              laid off as a consequence of reorganization and the university’s move away from its
              homegrown mainframe computing system.</p>
                  <p>Along the way Lawrence describes Stanford’s steam tunnels through which the radio
              station’s transmission lines ran, the campus telephone system, the implementation of
              ASSU special assessment fees that he helped create, and the experience of broadcasting
              live via KZSU the speeches given by public figures, including Mikhail Gorbachev,
              Barack Obama, Al Gore and the Dalai Lama, on Stanford campus.</p>

                  <p>In the first interview, Marion Lewenstein talks about her background and career
              trajectory at Stanford. She speaks about her family, her work at Women’s Wear Daily
              and Fairchild Publications, and her work in Stanford’s Department of Communication.
              She remembers many stories along the way and talks about people who were instrumental
              in her career, including the head of the communication department, Lyle Nelson, who
              hired her. She mentions people she has interviewed for her articles, including David
              Packard, co-founder of Hewlett Packard, and David Harris, the first husband of singer
              Joan Baez. She speaks fondly of Richard Lyman, president of the university when she
              arrived at Stanford, and of his wife Jing Lyman. She speaks of her cordial working
              relationship with Condoleeza Rice when Rice was Provost. She talks about how her
              supportive husband made it possible for her to juggle career with family
              responsibilities. Toward the end, she reminisces about one of the most memorable
              events in her Stanford career – her selection as a winner of the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel
              Award for Distinctive Contributions to Undergraduate Education – a recognition she
              never anticipated but gratefully accepted.</p>
                  <p>In the second interview, Lewenstein goes into more depth about her remembrances of
              people within the communication department and how both the department and the
              university changed over time. She talks more about Jing Lyman’s influence on the
              university and how Lyman encouraged the hiring and promotion of women because of her
              involvement in the women’s movement. She speaks about President Lyman’s role in
              keeping the university intact through the tumultuous years of protests on the campus
              during the Vietnam War era. Reflecting upon changes at Stanford over time, she delves
              into how the collaboration between and among departments has resulted in major
              innovations, including medical and technological breakthroughs that have profoundly
              changed today’s society. Her personal relationship with Fred Terman, who supervised
              Bill Hewlett and David Packard while they were students, resulted in her having
              interesting insights into Hewlett’s and Packard’s influence on the practices of
              Silicon Valley companies. She mentions her interactions with President Donald Kennedy,
              whom she credits with continuing to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations that
              positively changed the university and resulted in popular new courses, like human
              biology. In speaking of her role as academic secretary, which gave her the opportunity
              to get to know many faculty members, she talks about meeting Nobel laureate Steven Chu
              and his wife in their home and their search for the Nobel Prize. As the interview
              concludes, she summarizes her thoughts about the greatest challenges and
              accomplishments of her life, and reflects upon the changes in society as a whole,
              especially with respect to technology.</p>

                  <p>John W. Lewis, the William Haas Professor of Chinese Politics, Emeritus, established
              some of the first study programs in contemporary Asian politics in the United States.
              He founded or co-founded centers at Cornell University and Stanford University, helped
              to draft foreign policy for the federal government, and built cooperative
              relationships with leaders and scholars in China, Korea, Russia, and Vietnam. Although
              now retired, he continues to be active, writing books and giving lectures. </p>
                  <p>In this oral history interview, Lewis talks about his experiences working in a field
              that challenged deeply ingrained cultural and political beliefs. He describes what it
              was like to come to Stanford as an expert on the highly sensitive subject of China at
              the height of public unrest regarding the Vietnam War, and how that affected his
              relationships with both students and teachers. He recounts his recruitment to Stanford
              by J.E. Wallace Sterling, establishing the Center for East Asian Studies, the visit of
              the Chinese ping-pong team to Stanford in 1972, the climate of protest against the
              Vietnam War at Stanford, and the beginnings of the Center for International Strategic
              Arms Control (CISAC). </p>
                  <p>Lewis also discusses his experiences as an educator, including his involvement in an
              interdisciplinary course on nuclear arms and disarmament and conducting simulations of
              arms control talks with students. He describes some of his foreign policy work for the
              U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense. He reviews the impact his work
              has had on relations between the United States and East Asia, the current state of the
              field, and his ongoing work as an author, lecturer, and researcher.</p>

              year. He was an active participant in the Western Culture debate and in the changes in
              curriculum that followed. He also reflects on the evolution of the humanities at
              Stanford over the past forty-five years and on the changes in perception of the
              humanities over the years. Last but not least, he comments on his role mentoring
              graduate students with their dissertations.</p>

                  <p>In two interviews Jim Lyons describes his tenure as Dean of Students, the policies he
              tried to promote, and his approach to students in general. His focus is mainly on
              undergraduates. He discusses Residential Education at length and how he viewed it as
              an extension of academic education. He also discusses his expectations of student
              behavior and how he turned challenging situations into teachable moments. He describes
              the changes that took place in the make-up and culture of the student body (mostly the
              undergraduates) during his tenure as Dean of Students. Dean Lyons also talks about his
              work on the accreditation teams of a variety of colleges outside Stanford and his work
              with the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators. He opens the first
              interview by describing his personal background and his experience in the
              administration at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. He concludes with his work in the
              School of Education at Stanford.</p>

                  <p>James W. Lyons holds a B.A. in economics and history from Allegheny College, a M.S.
              in counseling and guidance from Indiana University, and an Ed.D. in higher education,
              also from Indiana University. After serving as a residence counselor at Indiana, he
              was program coordinator of the Indiana Memorial union from 1957-1959, and later
              assistant director of the same program. From 1963-1972, Lyons was dean of students at
              Haverford College in Pennsylvania, before moving to be dean of student affairs at
              Stanford starting in 1972. In 1984, he became a lecturer in Stanford School of
              Education, eventually earning positions as senior fellow in the Stanford Institute for
              Research in Higher Education and director of the master’s program in higher education.
              Dr. Lyons retired from Stanford University in 1998.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Lyons’ career has included active leadership in the National Association of
              Student Personnel Administration, and frequently speaking at national and regional
              conferences. A member of accreditation teams for 26 colleges and universities, he has
              also been a consultant to more than 75 academic institutions. Dr. Lyons has received
              numerous awards, including the Scott Goodnight Award for outstanding performance as a
              dean from NASPA. NASPA also designated him as a “Pillar of the Profession.” His
              extensive publication history includes many articles, chapters, and monographs. His
              tenure as Dean of Student Affairs at Stanford is remembered for its personal touch –
              Dr. Lyons made a point of walking around campus, talking to members of the community
              at all levels, and endeavoring to restore the damaged relationship between students
              and administration.</p>

                  <p>Rosemary McAndrews describes her childhood growing up in Butte, Montana, and San
              Francisco. She speaks of her experiences as a young working woman in San Francisco and
              New York in the late 1930s and during World War II, when she held various
              administrative positions with the Arabian American Oil Company.</p>
                  <p>Rosemary McAndrews speaks of her return to the workforce in 1969, when she started as
              an administrative aide to the Manager of Real Estate at the Stanford Land Management
              Group, and her rise through the ranks to her appointment as the manager of the
              Stanford Research Park and of the Stanford Shopping Center. She became the Director of
              the Stanford Shopping Center in 1978.</p>
                  <p>Her development philosophy and methods for both the Shopping Center and Research Park
              are discussed in detail, particularly her development of the Inner Circle and Street

                  <p>Rosemary McAndrews was born in Butte, Montana and raised in San Francisco,
              California. She attended St. Paul High School in San Francisco and was valedictorian
              of her high school class. She was awarded the only college (San Francisco College for
              Women) scholarship offered. However, she had to give up the scholarship because her
              family could not afford to contribute to her college education. McAndrews has been an
              auto-didact all her life. She also studied at Miss Miller’s Business College from 1938
              to 1939, took classes and seminars at Foothill Community College, University of
              California-San Francisco, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and enrolled in the Michigan State
              Shopping Center Marketing Courses. During her years at Stanford, she met with MBA
              candidates and occasionally was a guest lecturer at the Graduate School of
              Business.</p>
                  <p>Rosemary McAndrews worked at Stanford University for 24 years. Before that, she had

              manager of real estate. Her supervisor soon became manager of real estate and she
              became his administrative aide. Not long after, he left the university and McAndrews
              became assistant manager, then manager of all of the university’s non-academic
              properties, including the Industrial (now Research) Park and the Stanford Shopping
              Center. After a few years, she was appointed Director of the Stanford Shopping
              Center.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Eleanor Emmons Maccoby offered great insight into her career in
              the Psychology Department at Stanford University. Much of the conversation focused on
              her research into behavior, gender, and linguistic development, from the study of how
              young children behave to the ways in which language changes based on circumstance and
              age. She described the Psychology Department’s faculty and administration, as well as
              the ways in which it has changed over the years. Dr. Maccoby also spoke of the
              interdisciplinary research efforts that took place on campus during her tenure, and
              briefly touched on the difficulties faced by female faculty in the middle of the 20th
              century.</p>

                  <p>Born in Tacoma, Washington, in 1917, Eleanor Emmons Maccoby attended Reed College and
              the University of Washington in Seattle, obtaining her BS from the latter. She earned
              her MS and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in experimental psychology, focusing
              on topics related to the psychology of gender differentiation. Her research has
              encompassed the socialization of children, developmental change in personality and
              behavior, relationships of couples after divorce, parent-child interactions, and
              child-rearing practices. While working at Harvard, she conducted some of the first
              studies on the impact of television on families and children.</p>
                  <p>In 1958, Dr. Maccoby transferred to Stanford, where she became a Professor of
              developmental psychology and chaired the department from 1973-1976. In 1966, along
              with Robert Oetzel, Maccoby published her first book on sex-based differences, The
              Development of Sex Differences. Her most influential book was published in 1974,
              entitled The Psychology of Sex Differences, co-authored with Carol Jacklin. These
              publications stressed biological, rather than cultural, influences. Dr. Maccoby has
              published many books, articles, and papers on her research, and has received awards
              from the American Psychological Association, the Society for Research in Child
              Development, and the American Educational Research Association. She is a member of the
              American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was elected to the National Academy of
              Sciences in 1993. Division 7 of the American Psychological Association offers The

                  <p>Albert Macovski, the Canon USA Professor of Engineering, Emeritus has been affiliated
              with Stanford since 1960, first as a research engineer and staff scientist at the
              Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and then as a faculty member with expertise in
              medical imaging and a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering
              and the Department of Radiology. </p>
                  <p>In this oral history, Macovski talks about his family background and growing up in
              New York City in the 1930s. Among other things, he describes his father’s work as a
              jeweler, the impact of the Great Depression on his family, attending the New York
              World’s Fair, and his interest in ham radio. </p>
                  <p>Macovski recalls his studies in electrical engineering at City College of New York
              during the immediate post-war period and the significant change in his life occasioned
              by meeting his future wife, Adelaide “Addie” Paris. He describes obtaining a job at
              RCA Laboratories upon graduating from college and what it was like to work in the
              early television industry, including trying to solve problems related to
              synchronization and color television broadcasting.</p>
                  <p>Macovski talks about pursuing his master’s degrees at the Polytechnic Institute of
              Brooklyn and then working as an assistant professor there. He relates the factors that
              influenced his decision to accept a job at SRI: a desire to get his PhD, wanting to be
              where the action in electronics was, and the favorable climate.</p>
                  <p>Describing the environment at SRI in the 1960s, Macovski discusses his work on the
              Nimbus weather satellite and his invention of the single tube color camera. He
              describes the process of earning his PhD through Stanford’s Honors Coop Program, his
              dissertation on holography, and a post-doctoral fellowship from the National
              Institutes of Health that allowed him to study in the Department of Radiology at the
              University of California San Francisco. He goes on to describe joining the faculty at
              Stanford and his varied research projects, including work on ultrasonic array,
              recording images of the beating heart, and developing techniques to differentiate
              between hard and soft tissue. He also discusses a project to image the coronary
              arteries. Macovski recounts the story of how a sabbatical year offered him the chance
              to study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to work with Godfrey Hounsfield at the
              Medical Physics Department of Hammersmith Hospital. He describes obtaining an MRI
              system from General Electric and the process of getting it installed on campus. </p>
                  <p>Macovksi also discusses his approach to working with graduate students and offers
              reflections on the process of commercializing technology and obtaining patents. He
              concludes the interview with comments on new directions in the field of medical
              imaging and on his decision to endow a chair in the Electrical Engineering
              Department.</p>

                  <p>Hugh O. McDevitt is Professor of Microbiology and Immunology and of Medicine,
              Emeritus known for his work on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and its role in
              various autoimmune diseases. McDevitt discusses his critical research in proving the
              genetic basis for our bodies’ ability to recognize and defend against pathogens, both
              from a scientific and personal perspective.</p>
                  <p>He begins the interview by describing his early life and how his father, a surgeon,
              influenced his decision to pursue medicine. He discusses his undergraduate career in
              the late 1940s at Stanford University, described by others as a “good solid provincial
              university,” and his undergraduate work in Raymond Barrett’s genetics lab where he
              mapped the location of a fungus gene involved in metabolism. While the results of this
              research were not groundbreaking, he stresses the importance of this technique to his
              later immunology research. Beyond his academic experiences, he speaks about his
              student life, the jobs he took to help cover his tuition and board, and the death of
              his father.</p>
                  <p>McDevitt goes on to discuss his medical education and training at Harvard Medical
              School, his internship at Bellevue Hospital in New York—during which he rode the “home
              care ambulance” all over the city—and his military service in Japan. He recounts his
              research in Albert Coons’s lab at Harvard and his decision to come to Stanford School
              of Medicine as a faculty member in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology.</p>
                  <p>McDevitt explains how, prior to Stanford, he had observed a difference in the immune
              system’s reaction to a synthetic peptide between two mice strains. He goes into detail
              about how, at Stanford, he took a genetic approach to solving this problem and,
              through selective and extensive breeding, was able to identify the genes (later called
              the major histocompatibility complex) responsible for the strains’ different
              reactions. McDevitt gives a technical account of this research, the technical
              constraints of the day, and the research’s effects. </p>
                  <p>He goes on to talk about setting up and running his lab and his experiences teaching,
              practicing medicine, and chairing his department. At the end of the interview he gives
              his perspective of how Stanford changed from a “solid provincial regional university”
              to a “first-class university.”</p>

                  <p>James B. D. Mark discusses his childhood and early influences in choosing his medical
              profession. He discusses how he was recruited to the Stanford Medical School and the
              departments in which he served. He was Acting Chairman of the Department of Surgery in
              1974 and in 1988 became the Chief of Staff of Stanford University Hospital. He talks
              about the move of the hospital form San Francisco to the Palo Alto campus, and the
              relationship between the hospital administration and the medical faculty. He discusses
              the changes in the field of surgery and the medical student population. He also shares

                  <p>Thomas Merigan discusses his upbringing and education in the San Francisco Bay Area
              (Berkeley and UCSF) and his practice in infectious disease at Stanford, which spanned
              45 years, including many years as chair of the infectious disease department. He
              introduced the use of human interferon into the United States in the late 1970s as a
              treatment for viral diseases. He was also involved in interferon trials for treatment
              of cancer and multiple sclerosis. Merigan later became an expert in HIV/AIDS, taking
              care of patients at a time when the options were few. He saw many patients die of the
              disease. He founded the Center for AIDS Research and the AIDS Clinical Trial Unit,
              which was involved in testing of a number of promising new treatment options. These
              drugs became the mainstay of AIDS treatment at the time. Merigan also testified before
              Congress on the need for science funding. Merigan discussed his most famous patient –
              Pope John Paul II. He was called in to treat the Pope following an assassination
              attempt in 1981.</p>

                  <p>In the interview, Arjay Miller recalled his childhood growing up on a family farm
              near Shelby, Nebraska, and talked about his family history and origin of the family
              name. He described his life on the family farm with his seven siblings and all of
              their experiences and adventures, including games they played, songs they sang, toys
              they made, favorite foods, crops they raised, self-sufficiency and even a few close
              calls. In addition, he described the local community (churches, social events and
              schools) and the influences that farm life and growing up during the Depression had on
              him. He discussed the values he was given by his parents, including finding out how
              things work, making the most of what you have, and the love of reading and gardening.
              He covered books he read and radio programs, songs, and newspapers of the day. The
              interview included many stories and anecdotes that he told as a legacy for his

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Arjay Miller was born in Shelby, Nebraska, in 1916 and earned a Bachelor of Science
              degree from UCLA in 1937. After working as a part-time teaching assistant at UCLA, he
              worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He then served
              in the U. S. Air Force before joining Ford Motor Company in 1946 as part of a group of
              young military veterans who became known as the “Whiz Kids” for their role in
              retooling the auto giant’s business operations following World War II. He remained at
              Ford until he accepted the position of Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of
              Business in 1969.</p>
                  <p>Dean Miller served as the fourth Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business
              (1969-1979). Under his leadership, the School rose to the top ranks of management
              education institutions, expanded its endowment and created the Public Management
              Program. It was his experiences while at Ford, including communications with
              government regulators of the auto industry and failed efforts to bring jobs to the
              inner city in Detroit, that were the foundation for establishing the Public Management
              Program at Stanford . Through the program, Dean Miller sought to educate students in
              the concerns of government and society, and government in the needs of business.
              Within five years, the Stanford Graduate School of Business was voted the number one
              business school in the country. He was quoted in 1969 as saying, “The problems facing
              our society today are what I call public goods.”</p>
                  <p>The Dean was characterized as a serious, practical, and goal-oriented dean, but he
              was far from stiff. He enjoyed meeting with young MBAs. There was even a beer-drinking
              club dubbed the “Friends of Arjay Miller” – FOAM. Under Dean Miller’s leadership,
              student and faculty diversity in the GSB increased, with the number of African
              American students increasing from five to 24, Hispanics from zero to 34, and Asian
              American from four to 27.</p>
                  <p>In his tenure at Stanford, Arjay Miller was able to bring the lessons learned from
              private industry and create an environment for not only academic excellence, but also
              an awareness of and ability to influence the business world and government for the
              public good. Arjay Miller is Dean Emeritus of the Graduate School of Business at
              Stanford University. He is also an Honorary Trustee at The Brookings Institution.</p>

                  <p>Dr. William F. Miller has spent about half of his professional life in business and
              about half in academia. Dr. Miller came to Silicon Valley from a position as Director
              of the Applied Mathematics Division at the Argonne National Laboratory where he worked
              after receiving his PhD in Physics from Purdue University in 1956.At the Argonne
              National Laboratory Dr. Miller conducted research in basic atomic physics and in
              computer science. He and his colleagues began early work in what is now called
              computational science.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Miller was the last faculty member recruited to Stanford University by the
              legendary Frederick Terman who was then Vice President and Provost of Stanford. He was
              recruited to help form the Computer Science Department at Stanford and to direct the
              Computation Group at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). He led the
              computerization of SLAC and later as Associate Provost for Computing he led the
              computerization of the Stanford campus. He carried out research in computer science
              and computer systems and directed the research of many graduate students. As Vice
              President for Research and later as Vice President and Provost Miller championed the
              establishment of the Office of Technology Licensing which has become the model for
              such activities at other universities here and abroad .He actively facilitated the
              establishment of a number of interdisciplinary programs such as the Human Biology
              Program, the International Security and Arms Control Program, and the Values
              Technology and Society Program. In 1978 he negotiated and brought to Stanford the
              first students from the Peoples Republic of China. In 1979 he was named the Herbert
              Hoover Professor of Public and Private Management at the Graduate School of
              Business.</p>
                  <p>In 1968 Dr. Miller also played a role in the founding of the first Mayfield Fund
              (venture capital) as a special limited partner and advisor to the general
              partners.</p>
                  <p>As President and CEO of SRI International Miller opened SRI to the Pacific region, he
              established the spin-out and commercialization program at SRI and established the
              David Sarnoff Research Center (now the Sarnoff Corporation) as a for-profit subsidiary
              of SRI. He became the Chairman and CEO of the David Sarnoff Research Center.</p>
                  <p>In 1997 at the 10th anniversary of the founding of the David Sarnoff Research Center,
              Dr. Miller along with Jack Welsh, Myron DuBain, and James Tietjen received the Sarnoff
              Founders Medal.</p>
                  <p>In 1982 Miller was appointed to the National Science Board; additionally he served on
              the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Research Council. He
              has served on the board of directors of several major companies such as Signetics,
              Fireman’s Fund America, Wells Fargo Bank, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Varian
              Associates, and Borland Software Corp.</p>
                  <p>In 1990 Dr. Miller retired from SRI International and returned to Stanford half time
              where he taught technology-related courses, carried out research on the IT industry
              and on the characteristics of entrepreneurial regions. He also spent about half of his
              time working with start-ups and non-profits in Silicon Valley. He helped organize
              Joint Venture Silicon Valley Network and served on the board of directors for three
              years. He co-founded and served as Vice Chairman of SmartValley, Inc. Additionally he
              aided the formation of CommerceNet and served on the board of directors. Dr. Miller
              was a founding director and served as Vice Chairman of the Center for Excellence in
              Nonprofits, and was a Founding Member and Chair of the Campaign Cabinet (1992-1994) of
              the Alexis de Tocqueville Society of Santa Clara. He currently (in 2010) serves as
              Chairman of the Board of Sentius Corp, Nanostellar, Inc., and Lumiette, Inc. and is a
              Partner in Actium Ventures (Venture Capital).</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Anne S. Miner, a professor emeritus known for her research on management and
              organizational learning, worked at Stanford University in the 1970s as a consultant to
              the president on affirmative action for women and as the university’s affirmative
              action officer. She is recognized for her work in designing and implementing the
              hiring policies and practices related to under-represented minorities. This oral
              history focuses on the employment status of women faculty at Stanford and, to some
              extent, throughout academia from the 1970s to the present. </p>
                  <p>The first interview session revolve around Miner’s early life and education, her
              first job at Stanford in the Development Office, her involvement in the burgeoning
              “women’s movement,” and her work as consultant to the Stanford president on
              affirmative action for women in 1971. She discusses policy issues that affected women
              faculty and the formation of the Women’s Forum and the Committee on the Education and
              Employment of Women.</p>
                  <p>In the first and second interview sessions, Miner talks about her role as consultant
              to the president and the issues she handled, including Stanford’s policies regarding
              married couples’ faculty appointments, maternity and paternity leaves, the “tenure
              clock” as it affected women, and part-time employment of faculty. She also discusses
              the government regulations being passed in the 1970s that required affirmative action
              programs for all federal contractors and the pressure these regulations put on
              American universities. </p>
                  <p>Miner details issues such as salary equity for staff; training programs for faculty
              and staff to increase awareness of affirmative action requirements and procedures;
              child care needs, policies and practices; her role in ensuring that academic searches
              included women and minorities; and the creation of the Stanford Center for Research on
              Women in 1974 (now the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research). Miner then
              recalls her decision to leave her job in order to pursue doctoral study at the
              Stanford Graduate School of Business, her life as a female student with a small child,
              and the impact affirmative action had on her life as a student.</p>
                  <p>In the third and final interview session, Miner discusses her job as a professor of
              business at the University of Wisconsin and her primary focus and impact in the field
              of organizational behavior. Looking back, Miner reflects on how her Stanford
              experience in affirmative action has impacted the rest of her career. She also
              reflects on the progress women have, and have not, made over the past forty-three
              years, as well as the issues that still remain. As the interview concludes, Miner
              offers advice to young women embarking on their academic careers today.</p>

                  <p>Moulton revealed that he was hired specifically to do a survey of Stanford’s
              financial needs over the next 5 or 10 years. This was to be the prelude to a big fund
              drive, the first in Stanford’s history. It was clear from this oral interview that
              Sterling and Terman (President and Provost) were both optimistic about Stanford’s
              fundraising capacity. The Board of Trustees, however, was somewhat frightened at the
              magnitude of the proposed fund drive. Moulton had nothing to do with the Ford
              Foundation visiting and suggesting the utility of a survey of Stanford’s future
              financial needs. It was truly a coincidence that Moulton, who previously worked for
              the Ford Foundation, had already done the survey. Ford Foundation was going to give
              money to five major private universities, and Stanford was the only one west of
              Chicago. Given Moulton’s early work, the Stanford grant from Ford ($25m. to be matched
              by $75m. from other donors to Stanford) was the first from the Ford Foundation to any
              university filed earlier than grants to the other private institutions. That $100m.
              was to be raised over a three-year period and, to my great surprise, Sterling and
              Terman, and Cuthbertson, were sure that the momentum already present at Stanford and
              environs would produce an additional $200 m. Thus the PACE Campaign sought to raise
              $300m. The trustees chipped in heavily, but some of them doubted Stanford could raise
              the $300m. Moulton was originally tapped to be the head of the fundraising campaign,
              but he and the trustees did not get along politically. He therefore switched to
              Project M, the future SLAC.</p>

                  <p>Robert Harrison Moulton, Jr. was born in 1918 in Los Angeles, California. He was
              student body president at Beverly Hills High School before graduating Phi Beta Kappa
              and summa cum laude in Economics from Stanford University in 1940. His career in
              business was cut short in 1941 with the attack on Pearl Harbor, after which he
              enlisted and served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, finishing his
              tour as an Intelligence Officer to an admiral in the Atlantic fleet.</p>
                  <p>Moulton returned to San Francisco after the war to work with his father at RH Moulton
              &amp; Company, and he married Helen Elizabeth Bowman in 1946. In 1952, Moulton went to
              work for the CIA as an administrator in Virginia, a position he later left to join the
              newly-formed Ford Foundation, working as Assistant to the President. In 1958, he and
              his family returned to Stanford so that Moulton could direct his energy into helping
              get SLAC up and running. He served for seventeen years as an Associate Director of
              SLAC, after which he spent eight years as the Executive Director of the Mid-Peninsula
              Housing Coalition.</p>
                  <p>Though he was part of a family of successful businessmen, Moulton believed in working
              hard to help the less fortunate, as evidenced by his leadership of an organization
              dedicated to building affordable housing for families and seniors. As written by the
              obituary published on May 12, 2008 in SLAC Today, “He strongly believed that honesty,
              integrity and justice had to be practiced and not just preached.”</p>
                  <p>Robert Harrison Moulton, Jr. passed away in April, 2008, and was survived by his
              wife, his four children, three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.</p>

                  <p>A native of California, William D. Nix, Lee Otterson Professor of Engineering,
              Emeritus, received his baccalaureate degree from San Jose State in Metallurgy and came
              to Stanford in 1959 for his doctoral work. He worked his way through Stanford while
              teaching at San Jose State. Strong growth in federally funded research resulted in
              several additional billets in Material Sciences and led to an invitation to join the
              Stanford faculty in 1963.</p>
                  <p>Professor Nix was involved in the materials research at Stanford throughout his
              career and served in leadership roles at Stanford and in professional societies for
              more than forty years. In the interview, he describes his seminal contributions to
              understanding the mechanisms of high temperature deformation and fracture in the early
              part of his career and a transition over the last two decades to create of an entirely
              new field of materials science, specifically, thin-film mechanical behavior and scale
              effects in small volumes.</p>
                  <p>Professor Nix is an award-winning teacher and researcher who has trained nearly 80
              PhD students, an unusually large number of whom have remained in academia and hold
              leadership roles around the world in major research universities. In addition to
              describing his own work, Professor Nix discussed the early history of materials
              research at Stanford and the players who were formative in the field.</p>

              Materials Research Society in 2011. He received the von Hippel Award from the
              Materials Research Society in 2007 and in 2011 was awarded the Heyn Medal of the
              German Society of Materials Science. In 1987 he was elected to the National Academy of
              Engineering and in 2002 was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and
              Sciences. Prof. Nix was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003.</p>
                  <p>In 1966 he participated in Ford Foundation's "Residence in Engineering Practice"
              program as Assistant to the Director of Technology at the Stellite Division of Union
              Carbide Corporation. From 1968 to 1970 Professor Nix was Director of Stanford's Center
              for Materials Research. Professor Nix is engaged in research on the mechanical
              properties of solids. He is principally concerned with the relation between structure
              and mechanical properties of materials in both thin film and bulk form and is also
              engaged in research on the mechanical properties of materials for lithium-ion
              batteries. He is co-author of 450 publications in these and related fields and he has
              trained 77 Ph.D. students in these subjects in his years at Stanford. Professor Nix
              teaches courses on dislocation theory and mechanical properties of materials. He is
              co-author of "The Principles of Engineering Materials", published in 1973 by
              Prentice-Hall, Incorporated.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Nel Noddings, the Lee Jacks Professor Emerita of Education at Stanford University’s
              Graduate School of Education, is a philosopher and educational researcher best known
              for her ethics of care theory which she described in her 1984 book, Caring: A Feminine
              Approach to Ethics and Moral Education. Her care theory and educational philosophy is
              informed both by her graduate studies at Stanford in the 1970s and her long career,
              beginning in 1949, as a teacher and school administrator. She returned to Stanford as
              an associate professor in 1979 where, in addition to teaching and her research, she
              ran the Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP) and filled in as acting dean of the
              Graduate School of Education in the mid 1990s. In this interview she speaks about her
              professional and research career, set against the backdrop of her life as a wife and
              mother of ten during a time of tremendous cultural shifts in the country.</p>
                  <p>Noddings begins the interview describing her working-class upbringing in New Jersey
              during the Great Depression and World War II. She confides that as a seven-year-old,
              she identified more with her school than home, despite being raised in a loving and
              safe environment. She reminisces about her elementary and high school experiences, the
              classes she took, the school culture, and uses her academic training to assess how
              progressive they really were. She contrasts the substance of her high school education
              with the redundancy in her undergraduate education at Montclair State Teachers
              College.</p>
                  <p>Noddings describes her relationship with her husband, James Noddings, whom she met in
              high school, their courtship that began after they graduated, and early marriage after
              he returned from military service in Korea. She explains the ease with which they
              became parents and the reasons, after having three biological children, that they
              chose to adopt several Korean-American children. Noddings describes the educational
              and professional compromises she had to make because of motherhood and her husband’s
              profession. To balance this out, she shares several examples when her children
              participated in the educational programs she administered, as well as recollections of
              when the family moved so she could pursue her career goals.</p>
                  <p>She spends some time describing her first teaching position in Woodbury, New Jersey,
              where she spent three years with the same class of middle school students, and how
              this unique experience profoundly shaped her thinking on teaching, educational
              administration and academic research. She gives the example of how later, during the
              civil rights movement, if a protest or other incident affected the lives of her
              student, she’d take time off from her math lesson plan to help them understand and
              process the events.</p>
                  <p>Noddings explains how she initially approached her graduate school at Rutgers and
              Stanford as a means to advance as a school administrator. While she found pursuing
              math at Rutgers frustrating because of gender imbalances in the department, she
              describes her time at Stanford as transformative. Noddings explains why she switched
              from the educational administration track to philosophy of education after taking two
              philosophy courses. She notes how the learning and collaborative environment at
              Stanford supported her research and focus.</p>
                  <p>She discusses her thesis on constructivism in education and how her care theory
              became entwined with feminist theory. She expands on education theory, her frustration
              with the current emphasis on standardized testing, the pros and cons of high
              concept-based math programs like “new math,” the difficulties of teaching atheism, and
              the benefits of a more holistic approach to education.</p>
                  <p>Noddings describes the jobs she held after graduating: an academic position at Penn
              State, consulting in the Menlo Park area, and directing the Laboratory School at the
              University of Chicago. She explains how she landed the position of associate professor
              at Stanford running the STEP program in 1983 and later the Upward Bound summer
              program. She gives her impression of these programs and the changes they underwent.
              She describes her roles in Stanford’s administration: serving as the first female
              acting dean of the School of Education (now Graduate School of Education), working on
              Stanford’s Institutional Review Board for human subject research and serving on the
              faculty senate. It was in this last position that she argued for leniency towards a
              group of students who had barricaded themselves in the Dean’s office, an episode for
              which she explains her reasoning and results of her efforts. She describes her work
              after leaving Stanford, serving as president for the Philosophy of Education Society
              and chairing the ethics committee for the American Educational Research Association.
              She closes the interview by discussing her life after returning to the East Coast and
              the direction of her current research.</p>

                  <p>In this interview, Professor Ingram Olkin, emeritus professor of education and of
              statistics, shares his experiences of growing up in New York, his interrupted
              undergraduate education at the City College of New York while enlisted in the Army Air
              Force during World War II, his marriage while in the service, his graduate school
              years at the Columbia University and his exhilarating PhD graduate school experiences
              at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He describes how the University of
              North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the tutelage of his professor, Harold Hoteling,
              was a fertile ground both for the development of multivariate statistics and for the
              inter-institutional and international collaborations that marked the rest of his
              career.</p>
                  <p>After two assignments at Michigan State University and at the University of
              Minnesota, Ingram Olkin was recruited to Stanford with half time positions in the
              School of Education and the department of Statistics. He discusses his role in shaping
              both disciplines at a time when decisions were being made to turn both into
              world-class centers of excellence. He also shares his views on the hiring of women in
              mathematics and statistics, and the changing face of Stanford.</p>

                  <p>Marshall D. O’Neill worked at Stanford from 1952-1990 and was the Associate Director
              of the W.W. Hansen Laboratories. The award in his name allows faculty to honor staff
              for their administrative contributions to faculty research activities. He discusses
              the development and structure of independent laboratories at Stanford with all the
              attendant problem of establishing new management systems for these programs, including
              contracts, indirect cost recovery, and royalties. He was involved in the beginnings of
              SLAC, SSRL and worked closely with Robert Hofstader, Wolfgang P.F. “Pief” Panofsky,
              and William Fairbanks among other Stanford luminaries.</p>

                  <p>Nancy Packer begins her interview with references to her family and early years in
              Washington, DC. She credits her father with helping her develop an interest in
              politics. She talks about her undergraduate and graduate education as a time of
              maturing into a responsible student who studied theology as an intellectual pursuit
              rather than a religious one. Her early years as a writer were highlighted by a
              publication in Harper’s magazine.</p>
                  <p>Arriving at Stanford, Packer characterizes herself as a newlywed who was somewhat
              adrift in the unfamiliar world of the university. She recalls her development as a
              writer by noting the influences that Wallace Stegner had on her career. She shares the
              struggles she had with procrastination, the processes involved in developing a short
              story, and her growing self-confidence. Packer also acknowledges that opportunities
              were extended to her as her husband, an attorney, went from being a faculty member in
              the law school to an administrator at Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Packer describes her teaching career as being focused on the needs of students. In
              developing the freshman English composition course, she speaks of creating a class for
              the instructors of freshman English and her role in reducing class size. She also
              relates the history of the Creative Writing Program and her role in its development.
              Her publications range from books involving teaching to collections of short stories.
              Packer notes that her efforts to be a good citizen of the university resulted in her
              receiving all three awards the university bestows</p>

                  <p>Nancy Huddleston Packer was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Birmingham,
              Alabama. She was a Wallace Stegner Fellow in the Creative Writing Program at Stanford
              University after which she joined the faculty. She served six years as Director of
              Freshman English (1983-87) and four as Director of Creative Writing (1989-93), and
              retired in 1993 as Melvin and Bill Lane Professor in the Humanities.</p>
                  <p>Packer has published seven books. Small Moments received the Commonwealth Club of
              California Award for fiction. In My Father's House is a nonfiction work in stories
              about Packer's growing up among boisterous siblings and a strong-willed father who was
              a member of Congress. The Women Who Walk chronicles the lives of women in midlife
              travails. Jealous-Hearted Me, which received the Alabama Library Association Award,
              tells the story of the opinionated, outrageous Momma and her long-suffering daughter
              and son-in-law.</p>
                  <p>Packer's stories have appeared in numerous journals, such as Harper's, Yale Review,
              Virginia Quarterly, Epoch, and Sewanee Review. Her stories have been widely
              anthologized, including in O. Henry Prize Stories and Best American Stories. She has
              also co-authored two textbooks, The Short Story: An Introduction and Writing Worth
              Reading, both published in multiple editions.</p>
                  <p>Packer is the recipient of several awards from Stanford, including the Lloyd W.</p>
                  <p>Dinkelspiel Award For Outstanding Service to Undergraduate Education, Dean's Award
              for Distinguished Teaching, and the Richard W. Lyman Award for exceptional volunteer
              service to the university. Twice she served on the Pulitzer Selection Committee for
              fiction.</p>
                  <p>Packer is the widow of Herbert Packer, who was a professor of law and vice provost at
              Stanford. Their two children, Ann and George, are both writers.</p>

                  <p>he interview begins with a discussion of Bradford Parkinson’s childhood in Madison,
              WI, followed by an education in Minneapolis after a family move. He recalls the
              influence of his father and the self-discipline learned at the Naval Academy.</p>
                  <p>Parkinson tells of his move from the Navy to the Air Force, his time studying control
              theory and the maintenance of airborne electronics at MIT, where he forged a personal
              relationship with the inventor of inertial navigation system, Charles Stark “Doc”
              Draper. He talks about his decision to pursue doctoral studies at the University of
              Michigan, until a last minute “miracle” saw him heading for Stanford. </p>
                  <p>Parkinson discusses his next move, heading to Edwards, CA to work as an academic
              instructor at an Air Force test pilot school. He recounts his move to the Air Academy
              and his research into inertial guidance systems. He goes into great depth on his time
              developing the digital fire control systems and flying the planes in North
              Vietnam.</p>
                  <p>Parkinson then recalls his work at the Pentagon, working with Advanced Ballistic
              Reentry Systems in Los Angeles, and the joys of working again in research and
              development. He worked alongside the Army and the Navy on Operation 621B. Parkinson
              discusses the origins of GPS and his experience at the Department of Defense.</p>
                  <p>Parkinson describes the latter years of his career, teaching at Colorado State and
              then working in corporations such as Rockwell and Intermetrics. He details his return
              to Stanford, first as a consultant–alongside his work at Intermetrics–on Gravity Probe
              B, and then as head of the project. Parkinson discuss his years at Stanford and the
              changes that have taken place throughout the decades, including gender equality in
              academia and multi-disciplinary teaching. He recalls fondly taking over at the Trimble
              Navigation project in its time of need, overseeing the assembly of a new executive
              team and the soaring of the company’s stock prices.</p>
                  <p>As the interview draws to a close, Parkinson discusses his family and his passion for
              olive-growing.</p>

                  <p>P. Stanley Peters, Director Emeritus of the Center for the Study of Language and
              Information (CSLI) and a Professor Emeritus of Linguistics, is known for his work in
              the logical analysis of meaning in natural languages and computational linguistics. In
              the first interview, Peters discusses his career trajectory beginning with his
              undergraduate studies in mathematics and his graduate study of linguistics with Noam
              Chomsky at MIT. He reflects upon his path to becoming a professor at the University of
              Texas at Austin and describes how his mathematical background allowed him to create a
              more scientific approach to research in linguistics. He describes a formative time at
              the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and recounts his decision to
              move to Stanford after a term as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the
              Behavioral Sciences where he made fruitful connections that ultimately resulted in the
              formation of CSLI.</p>
                  <p>Peters discusses the growth of the Department of Linguistics at Stanford and his time
              as chair of the department and comments on Stanford’s approach to its faculty and
              students, its willingness to engage with industry, and the support the university
              gives to interdisciplinary research. He explains some of his research contributions
              including work on presupposition, quantifiers, and the formal properties of Chomsky’s
              transformational grammars. He also discusses his research on electronic tutors, or
              computers than can converse with humans, including work with the Office of Naval
              Research to develop electronic tutors that could teach ship handling. He converses
              about developments in machine learning that have led to programs such as Google
              Translate and Siri.</p>
                  <p>In the second interview, Professor Peters elaborates on the evolution and impact of
              CSLI, and discusses the creation of the interdisciplinary Symbolic Systems major at
              Stanford, which has become popular with students interested in the intersections of
              cognitive science, computer technology, math, and linguistics. He also discusses his
              work on the Committee for Technology and Learning, which the university convened to
              develop Stanford’s strategy for online learning. He talks about his family, his love
              of music and playing the organ, and his hobby of aerobatic flying, which he began to
              learn in his forties when he got his pilot’s license. He concludes the interview by
              offering advice to young people who are just beginning their careers, espousing the
              value of a liberal arts education rather than a strictly defined career goal at too
              early an age. He talks about the importance of teamwork, flexibility, doing something
              one loves, and having broad rather than narrowly focused interests.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In his 2016 oral history, Philip A. Pizzo, MD, former dean of Stanford’s School of
              Medicine, describes the long career in pediatrics and AIDS treatment that led him to
              California in 2001 and his mission to reinvigorate the university’s medical
              establishment.</p>
                  <p>Pizzo begins his narrative in New York City, where he was the first in his
              working-class family to graduate from high school. Like many first-generation
              Americans, Pizzo says, his family encouraged him to become a doctor and to “become
              something.” His reading, especially the book Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif and
              biographies of great scientists and thinkers, also drew him to the field of medicine,
              as did the historical context of the Vietnam War. Recounting the challenges and
              contributions of his years at Fordham University, the University of Rochester Medical
              School, and the elite Boston Children’s Hospital, Pizzo outlines how his career
              embraced both research and clinical practice in pediatric oncology and infectious
              disease.</p>
                  <p>Pizzo describes receiving a summons to join the National Institutes of Health in 1973
              and devotes considerable attention to his two decades there and especially to the
              young patients who influenced the direction of his research. First came ten-year-old
              Ted DeVita, who was confined to an isolation room because of a severely compromised
              immune system. That relationship, Pizzo points out, prepared him for the challenges of
              HIV and AIDS. By then the NIH chief of pediatrics, Pizzo explains that research in
              pediatric AIDS led to the development of continuous infusion therapy, which “made a
              pretty big splash” at the International AIDS Meeting in Stockholm in 1988. His growing
              reputation drew Elizabeth Glaser to Pizzo and NIH. He describes treating her two
              AIDS-infected children, as well as collaboration with Elizabeth and his admiration for
              her work as founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Seeking a new direction for his career as he turned 50, Pizzo discusses his brief
              return to Boston Children’s Hospital before Stanford made an irresistible offer in
              2000. Pizzo recalls the long deliberative process that resulted in his acceptance of
              the job as dean of the School of Medicine. The school and the two hospitals were
              experiencing considerable divisiveness at the time because of the failed merger with
              the University of California, San Francisco. Healing the wounds of that venture is
              what Pizzo sees as his first major challenge at Stanford, and he identifies the
              faculty’s revolt against the UCSF project as the most important element in its
              failure. He recounts in detail the issues involved in reconciling the School’s
              academic and clinical perspectives and his successful efforts to rebuild faculty
              morale and create an agenda to focus their energy toward the future. Pizzo also
              discusses outreach to the other academic schools at Stanford, resulting in the
              founding of the Department of Bioengineering. He describes initiatives that brought
              needed resources to the medical facilities and revitalized the way they worked
              together, including the beginning of the institutes, diversity initiatives, and
              fundraising programs.</p>
                  <p>Pizzo declares himself proud of the community that now exists in Stanford’s medical
              establishment, the care it provides to patients, and the national recognition it has
              achieved.</p>

                  <p>Over the course of three interviews, Dr. Sidney Raffel discussed much of his
              professional and personal life. He began with his parents’ immigration stories from
              Riga, Latvia, and outside Vilnius, Lithuania, and a brief description of his own early
              education. Dr. Raffel then spoke about his educational experiences at Johns Hopkins
              and Duke, before moving to Stanford for further medical training and a career
              teaching, researching, and practicing medicine in Stanford’s Medical school. During
              his tenure at Stanford, he was Dean of the Medical School and Chairman of the
              Department of Medical Microbiology. He discussed some of his research topics, like
              poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis. The interviews also encompassed some
              of his publications and work off-campus during sabbaticals and fellowships. The
              conversation concluded with a look at some of his activity during his lengthy
              retirement, including a passion for painting.</p>

                  <p>Born in 1911 in Baltimore, MD, to immigrant parents, Sidney Raffel graduated from
              Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930. In 1933, he added
              a ScD. in Immunology, also from Johns Hopkins. He initially came to Stanford in 1935
              with a one-year fellowship to study poliomyelitis, but he stayed on as an assistant
              instructor in the Medical School, completing his MD at Stanford in 1942. His career at
              Stanford lasted until his retirement around the years of the Vietnam War Protests on
              campus, though it also included sabbaticals to teach at prestigious international
              institutions like the University of Edinburgh, University of Kyoto, and the University
              of Shiraz. In 1949 he had a Guggenheim Fellowship in Basel, Switzerland. Dr. Raffel’s
              career at Stanford included over twenty years as Chair of the Department of Medical
              Microbiology and Immunology and two years as Acting Dean of the Medical School.</p>
                  <p>Among his many honors are a 1988 Society of Scholars Award and a 1992 J.E. Wallace
              Sterling Award for Distinguished Teaching. Dr. Raffel also wrote many articles,
              lectures, and editions one and two of the textbook Immunity. He has participated in
              NIH advisory panels, the Stanford Faculty Senate, and many other important
              organizations.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Sidney Raffel married Yvonne Fay (1909-2001) in 1938. She was a Public Health
              Nurse for Stanford at the time. They had five daughters. Dr. Raffel continues to live
              on the Stanford campus, and spends his time reading scientific journals and enjoying

                  <p>Professor Ramsaur begins his story with his recruitment to Stanford in 1971 as a
              young man of 23 with a wife and child. His personal development, changes and growth
              from 1971 to the time of his oral history interviews are parallel in many ways to the
              changes and shifts of the MFA program at Stanford. He starts by describing the program
              in 1971, the abrupt shift in focus when Professor Charles Lyons was appointed chair,
              and the social and technological issues that influenced him, his students, and the
              department over the years. He discusses the differences between the undergraduate and
              graduate programs. He mentions the role of the Stanford Institute for Creativity and
              Arts and how it has funded various projects, including a recent project in a small
              village in Uganda. Professor Ramsaur discusses his participation in international
              projects, including projects in Prague and China. He also talks about the history of
              the Committee for Black Performing Arts and the Institute for Diversity in the
              Arts.</p>
                  <p>In the second interview, he gives fuller insight into the topics covered in the
              previous interview. He concludes with a discussion of the influences of new
              technologies and changes in thinking about performing arts, including aerial dancing
              and experiential performing.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>The first part of the interview begins with Reaven’s decision to attend the
              University of Chicago for his undergraduate and medical degrees and what drew him to
              research. He recounts how the military’s use of the draft to recruit doctors
              influenced his decision to take a research fellowship at Stanford and recalls his, and
              his family’s, experiences when he was stationed in Germany.</p>
                  <p>He contrasted his impressions of Stanford’s hospital (then located in San Francisco)
              with the University of Chicago’s medical program and why he chose to do his residency
              at the University of Michigan. However, the change in direction of the Stanford
              medical school program -- both in the five year curriculum for students and the
              recruitment of full time professors to teach and see patients -- and the relocation of
              the hospital drew him back. He reminisces on the atmosphere at Stanford during this
              time as well as how he set up his lab and collaborated with fellow Stanford professor,
              Charles Lucas.</p>
                  <p>Reaven discusses what led him to his experiments that proved type II diabetes was due
              to insulin insensitivity, as opposed to lack of insulin in the blood, and how his
              research progressed. He recalls how he chose the topic of his famous Banting Lecture
              and the resulting awareness into the link between insulin insensitivity and increased
              risk of the individual to strokes and heart attacks.</p>
                  <p>The second interview focuses on Reaven’s administration experience with several
              divisions within the medical school and how he came to be the director of the
              Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the VA hospital, where he was
              able to implement “unconventional medical training.” He discusses his wife’s academic
              career (Eve Reaven holds a PhD in anatomy and worked as a professor at Stanford) and
              how they balanced careers and family. Reaven also recounts his work with committees to
              promote gender equality in medical admissions and tenure appointments, and what
              Stanford was like in the 1960’s.</p>

                  <p>Professor Rebholz opens the first session by briefly discussing his early life in St.
              Louis, his family and their importance in his life, his education in both public and
              catholic schools, and his time in the army. He discusses his year of graduate study at
              Stanford before entering the army, and his time as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where
              he eventually earned his D.Phil. He goes on to cover his arrival at Stanford in 1961,
              and his frustration over the firing of Bruce Franklin, a colleague in the English
              Department. He discusses faculty members and the departmental culture of the time, his
              classes and teaching, and his experience as department chair.</p>
                  <p>The second session starts with Professor Rebholz noting the importance of
              departmental administrative staff. He goes on to recount his time on Stanford’s
              Academic Senate, including his interactions with university presidents. He discusses
              his work with John Manley and their shared disapproval of the Hoover Institution and
              vehement opposition to the Reagan Library and Research Center. He also discusses his
              involvement in instituting the Western Culture courses and the need for students to
              develop both analytical and writing skills. Professor Rebholz notes other issues he
              raised on campus, including the university’s relationship to Webb Ranch and unionizing
              Stanford employees. The interview moves on to awards Professor Rebholz received, as
              well as his thoughts on both the growth of and changes at Stanford in terms of the
              campus and the community.</p>

                  <p>Niels J. Reimers, founder and former director of Stanford University's Office of
              Technology Licensing (OTL), begins his interview describing his family and living in
              Norway and Carmel, California. He describes his student days at Stanford and Oregon
              State as a mechanical engineering major, and he reflects on the three years he spent
              in the Navy on the USS Bon Homme Richard.</p>
                  <p>Reimers also discusses his experience as an industrial engineer at Ampex and his
              transition into marketing at Philco Western Development Laboratories (later
              Philco-Ford) where he learned about contract law and how to develop new products from
              scratch. Reimers recounts his work as lead negotiator for Ford Aeronutronic on a
              contract change to the Reentry Management Program with the US Air Force and his
              departure from industry.</p>
                  <p>Reimers describes his return to Stanford as Associate Director of Research
              Administration and his early interest in commercializing research inventions. He
              speaks of the system present at Stanford when he arrived in which there was no
              organized patent program. Inventions were sent to an outside company, Research
              Corporation, for licensing, and Stanford received minimal royalty income. Reimers
              describes the creation and approval of the pilot program for the Office of Technology
              Licensing and the development of a new royalty distribution system.</p>
                  <p>He remembers the inventors and inventions he worked with, including Bill Johnson’s
              synthetic juvenile growth hormone for pest control, John Chowning’s work with altering
              the perceptual location of sound in space for electronic keyboards, Stan Cohen’s
              plasmid and Herb Boyer’s restriction enzyme which led to recombinant DNA, and Art
              Schawlow’s lasers for erasing.</p>
                  <p>Reimers goes on to describe the autonomy he had managing OTL, his relationship with
              various deans of research, and working through potential conflicts of interest for
              inventors. He also discusses how OTL’s entrepreneurial model set it apart from other
              universities.</p>
                  <p>Reimers recounts his involvement with the Bayh-Dole bill, which gave universities the
              right to the results of their research. He later reflects on his time spent at MIT,
              the University of California,Berkley, and the University of California, San Francisco
              (UCSF) working to help them reform their technology licensing programs.</p>
                  <p>Reimers concludes the interview by summarizing his experience at Stanford,
              reminiscing about the research discoveries he came across, and reflecting on changes
              in the administration at Stanford, his retirement, and his activities after he left
              Stanford.</p>

                  <p>Burton “Burt” Richter begins his interviews by discussing his childhood in the
              boroughs of New York City and his early education at Mercersburg Academy in
              Pennsylvania. He then moves on to his time as an undergraduate and graduate student at
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as well as his academic turn toward
              physics under the tutelage of Francis Bitter and Francis Friedman. He discusses his
              brief stint at Brookhaven National Laboratory and his return to MIT, where he
              completed his evolution into a particle physicist and carried out his PhD research. </p>
                  <p>Richter next discusses his recruitment to a postdoc position at the High Energy
              Physics Lab at Stanford by Wolfgang Panofsky. Richter describes his role in the design
              and construction of the first electron-electron colliding beam machine at Stanford and
              his early years as a postdoc and later an assistant professor in the Physics
              Department at Stanford. Richter goes on to discuss the technical and bureaucratic
              challenges that ultimately led to the construction of the electron-positron collider
              and the resulting watershed research in November 1974 that led to his Nobel Prize in
              Physics. He also discusses the foresight of Sebastian Doniach and William Spicer to
              request the electron-positron collider be constructed in such a way as to release the
              x-rays and in so doing create a line of research that grew to become the Stanford
              Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). He further notes that their research not only
              revolutionized condensed matter physics, but also birthed Keith Hodgson’s structural
              biology program.</p>
                  <p>Richter also discusses his yearlong sabbatical at CERN and the research that led up
              to the construction of the Linear Collider Project. He then elaborates on this time as
              lab director at SLAC under Panofsky mentorship, and finally his years as Director of
              the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). He also comments on the variety of
              research programs which were started during his time at Stanford, including, the Linac
              Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the Fixed Target Program, the Stanford Synchrotron
              Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), and the Positron-Electron-Proton (PEP) Storage Ring.
              Richter concludes the interview by discussing his interest and recent work in climate
              and energy policy, which began in the mid-1990s and expanded when he stepped down as
              Director of SLAC in 1999.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Saul A. Rosenberg pioneered treatments for lymphoma and other cancers in the early
              1960s, and his work helped to establish the field of medical oncology. He collaborated
              with Henry Kaplan to run the first random clinical trials for lymphoma and Hodgkin’s
              lymphoma. Rosenberg gives a candid interview about the setbacks and serendipitous
              opportunities in his pursuit of a medical career in internal medicine and oncology
              that culminated in a decades-long career at the Stanford University School of
              Medicine.</p>
                  <p>He begins the interview by describing his background as a poor Jewish kid growing up
              in Cleveland, Ohio, the first of his family to go to college. Rosenberg recounts his
              plan to enter medical school at the age of 18 to avoid being drafted for World War II
              and the personal and bureaucratic obstacles that caused him to drop out as an
              undergrad. This apparent misfortune, he explains, led to a lab technician position in
              Hymer Friedell’s Atomic Energy Medical Research Project, which in turn gave him unique
              and sought-after skills in radiology and put him in contact with numerous researchers
              when he did enter medical school at Western Reserve University.</p>
                  <p>He recalls another seeming setback--being drafted to serve as a marine doctor--which
              interfered with his pursuit of a PhD but made him realize that he wanted to practice
              clinical medicine. He discusses his residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, where he
              was made chief resident and spent a year researching lymphomas in Lloyd Craver’s lab.
              He goes into detail about an influential paper he wrote: a statistical analysis of
              1,269 lymphomas, which was made possible by an early IBM punch-card computer.</p>
                  <p>Rosenberg discusses how, despite these accomplishments, he had a difficult time
              finding an academic position that would allow him to work with radiotherapies and
              internal medicine until Kaplan and Halsted Holman made a place for him at Stanford
              where he eventually held professorships in both medicine and radiation.</p>
                  <p>He began working at Stanford just as the medical school was relocating from San
              Francisco to the Stanford campus. He describes how his hospital experience was put to
              use by Holman as they developed their clinical program and how he eventually took over
              the role of physician-in-chief. He opines about what made the new medical school such
              a delight to work in and how more recent changes have diminished it. He talks about
              job offers he did not take and the failed merger with the University of California San
              Francisco, as well as his position on Stanford’s Advisory Board.</p>
                  <p>Rosenberg then goes into detail about the work that made him famous: his
              collaboration with Kaplan that revolutionized lymphoma--and specifically Hodgkin’s
              lymphoma--treatments, turning a terminal diagnosis to one of hope. He describes how
              Kaplan’s cutting- edge linear accelerator, as well as his own clinical expertise,
              improved patient care and allowed them to begin randomized clinical trials. Rosenberg
              muses on his personal relationship with Kaplan and mentions Kaplan’s children and
              their careers.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Rosenberg deliberates about what he feels are his real contributions: his
              children, his students, and his patients. He describes himself as a tree trunk that
              supports the beautiful leaves and flowers that are his former students’
              accomplishments and careers. And he takes humble joy in knowing that through his
              medical administrations, his patients have lived longer, and often remarkable,
              lives.</p>

                  <p>Professor Lawrence V. Ryan discussed his career at Stanford University from 1952 to
              1988 as a professor of English. At the time of his retirement, he was also the Atha
              Professor of the Humanities. Professor Ryan specialized in the study of Renaissance
              literature, primarily that of England but also with a secondary emphasis on Medieval
              and Renaissance Italian humanism. Professor Ryan also discussed his work with John
              Goheen, Professor of Philosophy, and Mark Mancall, Professor of History, to found the
              Structured Liberal Education program, an intellectually rigorous interdisciplinary
              program at Stanford. Professor Ryan was awarded the Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for
              1974-75 for outstanding service to undergraduate education.</p>

                  <p>During the interview, Professor Schimke discussed his early life and family
              background, and continued with a description of his education. He described
              classmates, courses, and colleagues from his time as an undergraduate at Stanford and
              on through his time in medical school and residency at Massachusetts General. From
              there, Professor Schimke explained how he came to return to Stanford in the department
              of Pharmacology and later, his move to the department of Biological Sciences. The
              interview included Professor Schimke’s assessment of the medical school and the
              academic departments in which he taught, and he pointed out both strengths and
              weaknesses, charting the progress over time. He explained some of his research on
              cancer, including explorations of proteins in egg whites and also the chemical
              methotrexate, used in chemotherapy. The interview concluded with a discussion of
              Professor Schimke’s art, from his earliest endeavors back in grade school to the
              development and experimentation in the years since being hit by a car while biking in
              1995, an accident which left him with limited mobility.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Robert T. Schimke was born in Spokane, Washington on October 25, 1932. He received
              both undergraduate (B.S. '54) and graduate (M.D. '58) degrees from Stanford
              University. After 2 years of medical residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital
              (1958-1960), he spent the next 6 years at the National Institute of Health (1960-1966)
              where his ground-breaking research showed that proteins were continuously both
              synthesized and degraded (first clear evidence for protein turnover). That the rate of
              turnover was important in regulation of biological processes and that the rate of
              degradation of a protein can be regulated.</p>
                  <p>He returned to Stanford University in 1966 where he was chairman of the Department of
              Pharmacology ('69-'72) and subsequently chairman of the Department of Biological
              Sciences ('78-'82. For the next 10 years, his research concentrated on how steroid
              hormones regulate the synthesis of specific proteins. On the cusp of the development
              of gene cloning, these studies helped develop many of the "new" techniques. In 1977,
              Schimke made another ground breaking discovery, gene amplification in mammalian cells.
              This discovery has been important for understanding genomic instability in cancer and
              in initiating the study of resistance mechanisms in cancer chemotherapy. Additionally,
              gene amplification is employed in the biotechnology industry for the synthesis of
              highly important protein products including erythropoetin (EPO), tissue plasminogen
              activator (TPA), and hemophiliac factor (HF).</p>
                  <p>The last 10 years of his research career were devoted to understanding how
              perturbations of cell cycle progression/regulation led to genomic stability (gene
              amplification and aneuploidy) or cell death (apoptosis). His publications can be found
              at Pub Med.</p>
                  <p>Schimke has received many honors for his research, including the Sloan Prize from the
              General Motors Cancer Research Foundation, and an American Cancer Society Research
              Professorship. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the
              Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences. He has served as President
              of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He has also served on
              editorial boards of various biochemical and molecular biology journals for over 34
              years and has served on various scientific advisory boards. In addition, some 100
              scientists have been trained/worked in Schimke's laboratory, many of whom have gone on
              to make significant contributions to biochemistry and molecular biology.</p>
                  <p>Schimke actually started painting in 1976 while on sabbatical in London, following
              the sudden death of his wife, Mary. Upon return to California he continued to paint
              for the next year. His paintings in oils depict scenes from London and California
              examples are presented (from about 20 paintings).</p>
                  <p>He "returned" to science in 1977 with the discovery of gene amplification, but in the
              mid-1980's Schimke has a second "burst" of art, focusing on natural products placed on
              canvas, emphasizing 3 dimensional qualities (representative works from that time are
              shown from about 15 pieces).</p>
                  <p>In February of 1995 Schimke's life changed dramatically and abruptly. While riding a
              bicycle in the bike lane on Sand Hill Road in Woodside, CA, he was struck by a car
              from behind and became a quadriplegic. He has fought back from total unconsciousness
              and total paralysis to the point where, although confined to a powered wheelchair, he
              has recovered sufficient motor function to allow limited use of arms and legs. Four
              years ago he started to express his creative and innovative talents with various forms
              of art... it is his new passion.</p>
                  <p>Eight years following his accident in 1995 he began a remarkable "burst" of
              creativity with various materials and media... all full of vibrant color, form and
              movement. He has produced some 400+ works in the past 2 1/2 years. He has explored
              many different genres to express himself. He has limited use of arms and hands and all
              paintings/drawings are done while in a wheelchair, and painted on flat surfaces in a
              studio in a former garage. An assistant helps with canvas construction and
              cleanups.</p>

                  <p>Stanley L. Schrier recalls his early life growing up in the East Bronx during the
              Great Depression. He decided he wanted to become a doctor by age six and eventually
              attended Bronx High School of Science where he was intellectually challenged and
              encountered excellent teachers. Schrier talked about his education then at New York
              University and at the University of Colorado where he transferred. In spite of
              rejections by medical schools due to Jewish quotas, Schrier was eventually accepted at
              Johns Hopkins where he found his way to hematology. </p>
                  <p>Schrier discusses his career at Stanford since 1959 when he became an instructor of
              medicine and hematology, just when the Stanford Medical School was moving from San
              Francisco to Palo Alto. He speaks with satisfaction all aspects of his role at
              Stanford, including research, patient care and mentoring, as well as his role as Chief
              of the Division of Hematology for over 26 years, during which he focused on developing
              expertise in the division and developing good teachers. </p>
                  <p>Schrier discusses his research focus on the red blood disease, Thalassemia, and the
              sabbaticals he took in Italy, Israel and Thailand in order to study the disease. He
              also discusses his research in anemia in the elderly since retirement.</p>

                  <p>The primary focus of the interviews with John J. Schwartz was his tenure as
              Stanford’s first General Counsel. In that capacity he served the full terms of
              Stanford presidents Richard W. Lyman and Donald Kennedy. The conversation ranged from
              Stanford’s handling of the student protests of the 1960s and 1970s to the Indirect
              Costs scandal of Kennedy’s term. Schwartz spoke of such complicated topics as
              Affirmative Action, the government’s anti-trust case against universities, and the
              ROTC. He also talked about the Stanford Judiciary Committee and the Stanford law
              enforcement, and the university’s relationship to outside organizations, like the
              Department of Defense and Military Research.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>John Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, in 1934, and grew up in White Plains, New York.
              He obtained his A.B. in physics from Cornell University, graduated from Harvard Law
              School in 1958, and practiced tax law in Phoenix until 1961. He then obtained a
              doctorate in physics from the University of Rochester in 1965, joined the Stanford
              Department of Physics in 1968 as a research associate, and was an appointed Assistant
              Professor of Physics in 1969.</p>
                  <p>At that time, Stanford, as many universities, had to cope with significant unrest
              over the Viet Nam War and responsibility for student discipline resulting from campus
              disruptions rested with a faculty-student disciplinary committee. At the request of
              Acting President Richard Lyman, John Schwartz agreed to serve on that committee and, a
              year later, became chair of the committee. In 1970, President Lyman asked him to join
              the university administration as Special Assistant to the President. The
              responsibility of the position was to be the coordination of all responses to campus
              unrest. Over the next two years, he re-wrote and managed Stanford’s student
              disciplinary procedures, guided the creation of the University’s own police force with
              peace officer powers, and oversaw the University’s handling of all campus disruptions.
              He decided when certain buildings would be closed to prevent sit-ins or other
              occupation, and when and where sit-ins would be permitted; and he determined when
              police would be called, and how the University would interact with local law
              enforcement authorities and the courts if arrests were made.</p>
                  <p>By 1972 the level of campus disturbances had decreased, and John Schwartz was
              appointed Associate Vice-President and Counsel for Medical Affairs, responsible for
              all legal matters arising in the Medical Center. There, he created the first full
              service in-house legal office at Stanford. The Office counseled, negotiated, prepared
              documentation, and litigated matters for the Medical School, Hospital and Clinics.
              This approach was different from that used in various legal offices elsewhere in the
              University, where it was common to retain outside law firms to do a good deal of the
              legal work.</p>
                  <p>In 1978, President Lyman chose to extend this approach to the entire University, and
              John Schwartz was appointed as Stanford’s first ‘University Counsel’. In 1981, he was
              named Vice-President and General Counsel, by President Donald Kennedy. The purpose of
              this centralization was to ensure that legal positions taken by attorneys throughout
              the University were internally consistent and in the best interests of the University
              as a whole, and to improve the cost-effectiveness and quality of legal services by
              leveraging the talent of the University’s own attorneys who had an intimate knowledge
              of the University.</p>
                  <p>From 1978, throughout the terms of Presidents Lyman and Kennedy, John Schwartz, and
              his two senior colleagues, Mike Hudnall, Deputy General Counsel, and Iris Brest,
              Associate General Counsel, steered the consolidation of all University legal services
              under the umbrella of the General Counsel’s Office, and created a fully functional,
              centralized, legal office providing services ranging from real estate, corporate,
              labor, intellectual property, tax, hospital, trust and estate law to academic freedom
              of the faculty and student admissions.</p>
                  <p>During that period, Stanford was faced with many legal issues of potential
              significance for years to come. There was considerable labor strife throughout the
              campus and it would be necessary for the University to present its views in
              unionization elections of all of its clerical workers, and unionization elections
              among interns and residents at the Hospital; it would be necessary to find a solution
              to historically failed discussions between Stanford and the Lucille Packard Children’s
              Hospital and to effect a consolidation of their operations; the further surge in real
              estate prices would require the development of an innovative shared appreciation
              mortgage program to facilitate the purchase of homes by new faculty and senior staff;
              the expansion of Stanford’s Overseas Studies programs to Asia would require a tax
              exemption never previously granted in Japan to a foreign educational institution; the
              University would refuse to accede to government efforts to prevent the dissemination
              of faculty research in cryptology; the bull run in stocks and availability of
              retirement fund custodians such as Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and others would
              lead Stanford to force TIAA to allow faculty and staff to transfer their retirement
              funds to other custodians permitted under Stanford’s retirement plan; the increased
              role of the City of Palo Alto in land use development would require the University to
              coordinate its first multi-jurisdictional approach to a new land use plan; and the
              increased diversity of investment vehicles and the expertise necessary to manage them
              would lead to the organization of the Stanford Investment Management Company to manage
              the University’s endowment, and a board of oversight over that Company with authority
              delegated to it by the Board of Trustees.</p>
                  <p>The legal services for matters such as these, together with the corporate issues
              expected in an enterprise involving 20,000 students and employees, a regional shopping
              center, and 8,000 acres of real estate, were provided by the General Counsel’s Office.
              Inside the University, the Office was seen as a key participant in policy making
              decisions; outside the University, it was described as a “tough as nails” opponent due
              to its refusal to settle suits lacking in merit. The breadth and depth of these
              services within Stanford was unique among private universities.</p>
                  <p>John Schwartz served the full terms of Presidents Richard Lyman and Don Kennedy. He
              describes his career as an attorney’s dream to have contributed to a great institution
              by working with two University Presidents who had such high values and principles, and
              the determination and resources to adhere to them. He retired from Stanford in 1993,
              after 25 years of service.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, W. Richard Scott, Stanford Professor of Sociology, Emeritus,
              discusses his early years in Kansas, graduate education at the University of Chicago,
              his academic career in the Stanford Department of Sociology, and his pioneering work
              in the field of organizational studies.</p>
                  <p>Scott describes his childhood and teenage years in Parsons, Kansas. He cites the
              stability provided by his father’s work at the post office during the Great
              Depression, his mother’s influence, and childhood bouts with asthma as formative
              factors in his life. He discusses his extracurricular interests during high school,
              his two years of junior college in Parsons, and his early interest in becoming a
              minister. Scott describes entering Kansas University as a junior, discovering his love
              of sociology, and earning his PhD at the University of Chicago, where he worked with
              Otis Dudley Duncan, Peter Blau, and Everett Hughes Cherrington.</p>
                  <p>Scott recalls his path to joining the Stanford Department of Sociology in 1959
              shortly after Fred Terman had recruited Sanford Dornbusch as a promising junior
              faculty member to chair and “restart” the department, which had been granted
              additional billets to fill. He describes the highly collaborative nature of the
              department, as five newly-hired, young sociologists crafted the curriculum, designed a
              new graduate training program, and worked together on an NSF grant. By the end of the
              1960s, Scott recalls, it felt like things were really happening academically at
              Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Turning to his research on organizations, Scott recounts seeking out faculty from
              across the university who were studying different aspects of organizations. They
              formed a community, secured critical funding from the National Institute of Mental
              Health, and proceeded to develop an exciting new field of organizational studies.
              Organizational studies flourished at Stanford for twenty years and three of the most
              important theories in the field were developed here during that period.</p>
                  <p>Describing the trajectory of his research, Scott explains that he has worked on
              widely divergent topics over his career: authority and control systems in multiple
              settings, the effectiveness and quality of care in hospitals, organizational
              structures in K-12 education, changing health care delivery systems, global
              infrastructure construction projects, and the San Francisco Bay Area system of higher
              education. He also mentions serving on government grant peer review panels for many
              years, an experience which he found intellectually rewarding.</p>
                  <p>Scott, who won the H&amp;S Dean’s Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1987, stresses
              the importance of teaching and extolls the virtues of the doctoral oral examination.
              He relates the thinking that went into the writing of his three core textbooks on
              organization studies and the influence the books have had. He comments on four of his
              most meaningful professional awards and reflects on some of the Stanford leaders he
              knew and admired: Dick Lyman, Al Hastorf, Ray Bacchetti, and Ken Cuthbertson. As an
              observer of Stanford as a bureaucracy for over fifty years, Scott notes a recent
              movement away from the collegial structure in which departments serve as the primary
              units, setting a disciplinary-centered agenda. Scott closes the interview by
              commenting on the benefits of living on the Stanford campus since 1962 and his active
              involvement with Avenidas Village, a system that supports seniors who want to stay in
              their own homes as they age.</p>

                  <p>Paul S. Seaver, Professor of Early Modern English History, Emeritus, begins his
              interview by discussing his childhood on his family’s dairy farm in a Quaker community
              in rural Pennsylvania. He discusses being a conscientious objector, refusing to
              register for the draft for the Korean War, and consequently serving time in prison in
              Danbury, CT. He recalls his years as an undergraduate at Haverford College and as a
              graduate student at Harvard University. He recounts his early career at Reed College
              in Portland, Oregon, and how he later came to Stanford University. He describes
              evolutions in the Stanford undergraduate curriculum related to the teaching of western
              civilization and changes in the faculty in the Department of History, as it slowly
              became more inclusive of women and minorities. He pays particular attention to the
              radicalism on campus during the civil rights movement and Vietnam War, and his
              involvement as a draft counselor, which causes Seaver to segue into further reflection
              on his time at Danbury penitentiary. Seaver comments on the exclusion of minorities in
              admission processes until 1964 when, with the hiring of a new dean of admissions, he
              immediately began to see changes in the student population.</p>
                  <p>Seaver discusses his research for the book Wallington’s World and his fascination
              with working-class and urban life in seventeenth-century England. He briefly relates
              his research to the radicalization of societies more generally and comments on modern
              politics. He also touches on what he appreciates about his career at Stanford and
              raising his family in Palo Alto. Seaver concludes his interview by discussing his
              Jewish immigrant heritage, his parents’ early life and eventual conversion to the
              Quaker religion, and his father’s work with the American Friends Service
              Committee.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Lucy Shapiro, a renowned developmental biologist, begins her oral history interview
              by discussing her childhood in New York City, her early educational focus on the arts,
              and the importance of her family life and Jewish heritage in shaping her character.
              She explains her transition to scientific research after graduating from Brooklyn
              College, attributing much of the credit to her mentor, Ted Shedlovsky. </p>
                  <p>Shapiro details her time as a lab technician and a graduate student and describes her
              rise in the field, from her graduate school discovery of what viruses in
              double-stranded RNA look like to how she came to research the Caulobacter bacterium,
              the defining research of her career. </p>
                  <p>Throughout the interview, Shapiro discusses the importance of science and how vital
              it is to encourage young people to pursue science. She believes both science and the
              humanities are valuable and beautiful, and she explains how her two passions--biology
              and painting--inform each other. Shapiro discusses the role of family in her life
              extensively, explaining how she has balanced her working life and her family life
              throughout her career. She also discusses the importance of mentors and how she
              incorporates the lessons she has learned from those who guided her into her own
              mentoring. </p>
                  <p>Shapiro, the first woman to chair a department in the Stanford University School of
              Medicine, comments on how her identity as a woman has affected her work. She recalls
              some previous sexist incidents, but she concludes that the confidence she has in her
              work and herself, along with the strategies she has developed to command respect, have
              caused gender to have very little effect on her ability to achieve success. </p>
                  <p>Shapiro discusses leaving Columbia University for Stanford University in 1989 when
              she was invited to establish the Department of Developmental Biology. She explains
              what she believes sets Stanford apart from and above other peer institutions,
              particularly its non-hierarchical atmosphere of communication and collaboration. She
              describes the research she and Harley McAdams completed together and her passion for
              interdisciplinary scientific research, as exemplified by the establishment of Stanford
              Bio-X. </p>
                  <p>Shapiro discusses the development of her career since arriving at Stanford, including
              improving her ability to speak to non-scientific audiences in a comprehensible manner.

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Marshall Smith, professor and dean of Stanford University’s School of Education from
              1986 to 1993, helped shape American education policy through his broad academic
              research and his service in three presidential administrations. At Stanford, he guided
              the school through a budget crisis, augmented its academic curriculum with practical
              applications, and increased the diversity of both faculty and students.</p>
                  <p>Smith begins the interview with a brief overview of his childhood spent moving
              between New Jersey and several other states due to his father’s job as a military
              psychologist during World War II. He relates how an early stint as a computer
              programmer gave him the technical expertise to perform the automated analysis of
              textual content, which became his initial research focus as a graduate student at the
              Harvard School of Education.</p>
                  <p>Smith describes his shift into the study of education policy. He explains his role in
              the review of the Coleman Report, a massive survey of educational conditions in the
              United States undertaken in the mid-1960’s, and how he joined the project through his
              connection with Pat Moynihan, then a professor at Harvard. Smith speaks about his
              faculty appointment at Harvard, founding the Center for Education Policy Research with
              Christopher Jencks and David Cohen, and the work he did to analyze the initial results
              from the Head Start program.</p>
                  <p>Smith then explains his entry into government work, discussing how he ran the reading
              program at the National Institute of Education and then advised on educational policy
              in the Carter administration. He explains how his advancement to a senior leadership
              position in the newly formed Department of Education was initially derailed by the
              conclusion drawn in his book, Inequality, that there was not a strong correlation
              between student achievement and school desegregation. While he defends his statistical
              finding, he relates his own personal distaste for school segregation, formed during
              his youth when his father took him to see the rundown conditions in a nearby African
              American school, when his family lived in Georgia.</p>
                  <p>After touching on his time as a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
              his participation in an educational delegation to China in 1980, Smith details how he
              was recruited to Stanford in 1986 to be dean of the School of Education. Ruminating on
              his deanship, Smith talks about efforts to increase student diversity in the Stanford
              School of Education and at the university level through his work with the University
              Committee on Minority Issues. He discusses efforts to improve faculty diversity as
              well.</p>
                  <p>Smith recalls some of his other goals as dean including expanding the school’s
              influence in policy and practical applications. He explains how establishing national
              and state level policy centers at the university facilitated these changes, and he
              runs through the many retirements and hires during his tenure. He discusses how budget
              issues in 1989 involved him in a university-wide administrative reorganization and
              drove him to implement changes to his own school, including starting a financially
              lucrative master’s program and a training program for school principals. He talks
              about his research work with Jennifer O’Day on primary education standards and
              testing, the results of which eventually made their way into national standard
              discussions.</p>
                  <p>Smith explains the events that again drew him into government: his work with the
              Democratic-controlled Congress under the first Bush administration and his friendship
              with then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton. He speaks about requesting a break from
              Stanford to serve on Clinton’s presidential transitional team, which became permanent
              when he was given the job of Under Secretary of the Department of Education, and tells
              the story of his return to Stanford in 2000.</p>
                  <p>Smith then speaks about his later career and projects: directing the Education
              Program at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, developing resources for early
              online courses, advising the Obama administration on distributing primary education
              stimulus money, and his non-profit work in Pakistan. He gives his impressions of the
              political environment when he worked with different administrations.</p>
                  <p>Smith closes the interview talking about cooperative learning theory, his optimism
              that programs like Common Core and Social Emotional Learning will improve educational
              outcomes, and his thoughts on charter schools.</p>

                  <p>George Somero’s pioneering research with marine animals living in extreme conditions
              revealed the biochemical and genetic changes that allow them to thrive under these
              conditions and has increased our understanding of how a changing climate could affect
              marine life. In this interview he discusses his career at various research facilities
              including Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station.</p>
                  <p>He begins the interview by briefly recalling his childhood and undergraduate
              education at Carleton College in Minnesota before describing his graduate studies at
              Stanford University. Somero details his time as one of the first researchers at the
              Antarctic McMurdo station where he studied fish that could survive in near-freezing
              water. He explains how he became a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British
              Columbia and his relationship with his lab’s primary investigator, Peter
              Hochachka.</p>
                  <p>Somero discusses his work as a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
              how he met his second wife, and their work exploring newly discovered hydrothermal
              vents as part of an Alpha Helix expedition. He relates why he left Scripps for the
              University of Oregon and why he then chose to go to Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Somero talks about his experiences at the Hopkins Marine Station, both as a graduate
              student and as a professor. He relates the unhappy circumstances that required him to
              take over directorship from his friend Dennis Powers, as well as career highlights,
              such as when he found out he had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He
              describes his own unsuccessful retirement, his current position at Hopkins, and his
              current interests -- working with the Big Sur Land Trust, the Monterey Bay Aquarium
              Research Institute, and writing his third book.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the interview, Somero touches on how his research, teaching, and outreach
              are important to understanding the effects of global warming. He maintains that it is
              a balancing act between recognizing scientific realities while maintaining hope that
              humans can change our present trajectory.</p>

                  <p>The panelists describe how they came to work at Stanford, and the different family
              situations they each found themselves in when they began their careers. They discuss
              the lifetime of hard work and dedication necessary to be a woman paving the way for
              female representation in the academia. They shed light on the different atmospheres
              they experienced starting out in their respective fields, including prejudice against
              and indifference towards them as young women. The panelists go into great detail about
              the influence and importance of the rise of feminism to not only their own careers,
              but to the university and the academia in general. They discuss the evolution of
              issues such as tokenism, affirmative action, the sexual harassment “troubles” of the
              1970s, and the interplay between the anti-war and civil rights movements and the
              feminist movement. The panelists look back to certain points in their careers where
              they feel being a woman gave them undue influence or promotion, and discuss the
              implications of this on the advancement of the feminist cause.</p>
                  <p>Throughout, the panelists share richly drawn anecdotes and humorous personal stories
              that have stuck with them over the years, such as Herzenberg’s incredible account of
              dinners with scientists Erwin Schrodinger and Albert Einstein, and the overwhelmingly
              positive feminist reaction, and the subsequent reversal of it, to Maccoby’s The
              Psychology of Sex Differences. They reflect on what they have learnt and what they
              hope they have enabled the women they taught and the young girls of the future to
              achieve, adding jokingly that taking computer science or becoming an engineer is the
              best advice they can give. They discuss passionately the direction in which gender
              equality is moving across the board, from the technology and science industries, to
              English and psychology faculties in the academia.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, five distinguished professors at the Stanford University School
              of Medicine--Hebert L. Abrams, Paul Berg, James B. D. Mark, Stanley L. Schrier, and
              Philip Sunshine--discussed the Medical School’s move from San Francisco to the
              Stanford campus in 1959 and its implications. They described the new format for
              medical education envisioned by the university president and the Board of Trustees,
              the impact of the integration of the teaching and clinical operations on the Stanford
              campus, and how Stanford gained a reputation for innovative, high-quality medical
              care.</p>
                  <p>The panelists discussed the forces behind this move: the Flexner Report on medical
              education in the United States and Canada and the university’s assessment of its
              program’s condition after World War II. They also talked about the challenges the
              Medical School faced as a result of the move, including the creation of an adequate
              patient base to ensure the success of the medical school and hospital (which
              occasioned hostility from local physicians, hospitals and clinics) and the need to
              recruit faculty, physicians, and researchers.</p>
                  <p>In the course of the discussion, the panelists also addressed differences among their
              departments regarding the sharing of research resources.</p>

                  <p>eter Stansky, Francis and Charles Field Professor of History, Emeritus, came to
              Stanford in 1968 as a modern British historian. He served as Chair of the History
              Department, Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences, and Chair of the Faculty
              Senate. His interests included the Bloomsbury Group, William Morris, George Orwell and
              Julian Bell. He discusses in detail the lessening of student interest/majors in
              history and the other humanities; discrimination against Catholics, Jews, gays, and
              women in academic life; Stanford’s overseas program; and programs of the Stanford

                  <p>Bill Stone became an instant California native when the SP train pulled in at the
              Palo Alto station at the end of Palm Drive at the start of his freshman year in 1963.
              He has renounced his previous Peoria, IL, Deerfield, MA and Exeter, NH citizenships
              despite demands from the Birthers to validate his checkered ancestry.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to a series of compound-complex misunderstandings, he managed to do the next
              best thing to being a permanent Stanford student by finding employment opportunities
              at 94305 starting in 1969, which had the advantage of shifting the cost of attendance
              slightly in his favor after B-School. When finally timed-out in 2001, he joined a
              consulting partnership which “screws up other schools” and affords him the chance to
              trade lies with several Ivy-Plus moguls who are his fellow eAdvancement
              principals.</p>
                  <p>His only claims to respectability are (1) his supremely talented and wonderful spouse
              Debbie (Duncan ’76); (2) three terrific and inspiring adult kids, Jennifer, Allison

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>This oral history interview with Robert Street begins with his description of how
              three things came together to place him on his career path at Stanford: excellent high
              school (Beverly Hills), undergraduate degree program at Stanford, and his Navy
              training (both ROTC and active duty). He was “in the right place at the right time” to
              be appointed assistant executive head of the civil engineering department in 1962 –
              the beginning of a dual path of both academic and administrative careers. He became
              department chair in 1972. Street talks about his academic and administrative
              experiences throughout the interview, often giving credit to the management and
              leadership skills he acquired in the Navy. He talks about teaching elementary fluid
              mechanics and statics. He also describes the changes in the campus, from being
              surrounded by farms when he arrived to being surrounded by what is now known as
              Silicon Valley today, from being a “very good” private school to a “much stronger
              technical university.” He discusses how Stanford engineering graduates are distinct
              from those of other schools as they tend towards policy or leadership or management
              roles as opposed to technical engineering roles. He mentions his fellowships and
              sabbaticals and also his efforts to maintain his research pursuits along with his
              management and administrative responsibilities.</p>
                  <p>Street traces the evolution of the computer from IBM punched cards to PCs and Apples
              (including negotiations with Steve Jobs) to current computer technology. He talks
              about the evolution of information systems and his responsibilities as the Vice
              President for Information Resources (later as Vice Provost and Dean of Libraries and
              Information Resources). He oversees various information systems such as LOTS and
              SPIRES, as well as various computer languages such as ALGOL and FORTRAN. He describes
              Stanford’s relationships with some Silicon Valley companies such as Sun and Cisco, as
              well as his relationships with many people including Ralph Goren, Bill Yundt and
              Michael Carter.</p>
                  <p>Street eventually returned from administrative duties to teaching and he describes
              the significant changes in teaching methodologies that had taken place due to changes
              in technology. He also describes the change from the “just do it” management approach
              of earlier years to the consensus styles of later years. He details his experience
              with information systems and his emphasis on protecting the acquisitions budgets of
              the libraries. Street has a high regard for the quality of students at Stanford,
              describing them as “superb on every level” and giving numerous examples. The interview
              concludes with a discussion of his retirement in 2004, his ongoing interests and
              contacts, and his wife and family.</p>

                  <p>Myra Strober is Professor of Education, Emerita at the Stanford Graduate School of
              Education and Professor of Economics (by courtesy) at the Stanford Graduate School of
              Business. Her research and consulting focus on gender issues in the workplace, the
              economics of work and family, and multidisciplinarity in higher education. Her
              two-part interview begins with her early years in Brooklyn, New York, where her
              interest in economics formed. Strober recalls her undergraduate education at the
              School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, her master’s program
              at Tufts University, and her doctoral studies at MIT, where she was one of only two
              women in her class. She relates how she eventually made her way to California,
              teaching as a lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley before taking an
              assistant professorship at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.</p>
                  <p>Strober discusses her initial experiences teaching on the virtually all-male faculty
              at the Business School, her attempt to secure tenure there, and how she became a
              tenured faculty member at the School of Education. She recounts the events that led to
              the creation of the Center for Research on Women at the university and how she became
              its founding director. She discusses fundraising for the center and the lecture series
              that attracted overflowing crowds from the campus and neighboring areas. In addition,
              she discusses her service on the Committee on Recruitment and Retention of Women
              Faculty at Stanford and her experience as a sexual harassment advisor counselling
              female faculty members. She shares her perspectives on the challenges facing women in
              academia, such as a low percentage of women on the tenured faculty, salary disparity,
              and a lack of support.</p>
                  <p>Strober also relates the story of how Stanford successfully competed to host and edit
              the preeminent women’s studies journal, Signs and its impact on the faculty and
              students involved. She discusses her research on occupational segregation, including
              her theory of how the relative attractiveness of occupations impacted work
              opportunities for women, and her research on childcare. Strober concludes with an
              assessment of some of the ways Stanford has changed over time.</p>

              continues on to his time as an undergraduate and master’s student at Penn State and
              MIT respectively, his work with the U.S. Geological Survey in West Texas, and his time
              spent in the navy before coming to Stanford to pursue his PhD under the mentorship of
              Professor Aaron Waters.</p>
                  <p>Thompson also discusses his early teaching experiences at Stanford and the atmosphere
              of the newly formed Geophysics Department. Thompson goes on to describe going back to
              work with the U.S. Geological Survey in Nevada after graduating and later returning to
              Stanford as a professor. He further discusses his approach to teaching and his role in
              shaping the School of Earth Sciences as chair of the Department of Geophysics and
              Department of Geology. He notes his interactions with the administration after
              succeeding Allan Cox as dean of the School of Earth Sciences, appointing and
              evaluating junior faculty, and working with university donors such as Cecil Green. </p>
                  <p>Thompson also discusses Earth Sciences’ connections with the oil industry and his
              memories of the Loma Prieta earthquake. He speaks of the consolidation of departments
              and changes in the School of Earth Sciences under new dean Gary Ernst. He then delves
              into his research in transition between the Sierra Nevada and the basin ranges, his
              time at Lamont Geological Observatory of Columbia University, fieldwork experiences in
              New Zealand, and the evolution of the disciplines of geology and geophysics. He
              describes his time on the USGS Advisory Panel and discusses issues of nuclear waste
              disposal and fracking. Thompson reflects on his involvement with geophysics and
              geology organizations, including the Geological Society of America and American
              Geophysical Union, and speaks about the notable awards he has received in his career.
              Thompson concludes the interview by discussing his family life, forestry work, and
              continued involvement at Stanford as an emeritus professor.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, the writer Helen Pinkerton Trimpi recounts the path that led
              her to study English and poetry at Stanford University in the late 1940s and describes
              her experiences as a student of Ivor Winters and a lecturer in the Stanford Department
              of English. She reads her poem Autumn Drought (1976), which she wrote about Stanford
              and Winters.</p>
                  <p>Trimpi begins with an account of her childhood in Butte, Montana and Mount Vernon,
              Washington. She recounts how Ray Cowell, her high school teacher and a Stanford alum,
              sparked her interest in journalism and encouraged her to apply to Stanford. Trimpi
              describes how her interest in English and creative writing, especially poetry, evolved
              at Stanford as she studied with the poets Ivor Winters and J. V. Cunningham. She
              describes being a student in Winters’ classes and speaks about the early days of the
              Stanford Creative Writing Program, which was founded by Wallace Stegner. Trimpi also
              describes student life at Stanford during the post-WWII period, including her
              experience writing columns for both the Stanford Daily and the Palo Alto Times while
              an undergraduate.</p>
                  <p>Trimpi talks about meeting fellow Stanford student, Wesley Trimpi, whom she married
              in 1950. She recounts details of their travels in Europe, attending graduate school at
              Harvard, and their return to Stanford when Wesley joined the faculty of the Stanford
              English Department. Trimpi describes the culture of the department and talks about
              being a faculty wife and a lecturer in the English Department from 1962 to 1975. She
              discusses her opinion of curricular changes at Stanford and the women’s movement of
              the 1970s.</p>

              Alumni Association’s Travel Study Program, 1968-1993. He touched upon the growth of

                  <p>In 1972 Peter (Stanford, 1965) joined the Stanford Alumni Association as a marketing
              consultant for the Stanford Alpine Chalet and soon after became the
              business/advertising manager of the first seven issues of Stanford magazine. In 1974
              he took the reins of the Association’s fledgling Travel/Study Program, which he spent
              the next 18 years developing it into one of the premier alumni travel programs in the
              United States. Under Peter's leadership, the Travel/Study Program expanded from 3
              programs in 1973 to more than sixty in 1992. He established Peter Voll Associates
              (PVA) in 1983 as an independent venture and in 1993 left Stanford to devote himself
              full time to PVA. A significant amount of his business was in the Middle East, and
              after 9.11. 2001, Peter merged his company with High Country Passage.</p>
                  <p>For PVA and High Country Passage Peter organized, marketed, and managed educational
              tours for alumni associations, museum memberships, and special interest groups and
              corporations. Clients included Smithsonian Associates, American Museum of Natural
              History, National Parks and Conservation Association, National Audubon Society,
              National Geographic Expeditions, and National Trust for Historic Preservation; the
              Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Smith, Columbia, Stanford, MIT, Northwestern, Rice,
              University Chicago, UC-Berkeley, Cal Tech, UCLA, and USC alumni associations; and the
              Hoover Institution at Stanford University, Common Wealth Club of California, and the
              California Academy of Sciences.</p>
                  <p>During his career Peter has designed and implemented more than 200 different
              educational tours to U.S. and worldwide destinations, by land, ship, train, riverboat,
              and private jet charter. He launched a number of travel industry firsts: tourist trips
              to the People’s Republic of China in 1978, and alumni tours to Burma (now Myanmar) in
              1979, cruise tours to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1992 and land tours to the
              Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1997; in 1995 the first cruise ship voyages to the Arabian
              Gulf between Kuwait and Oman; in 1992 the first university alumni association charter
              of a Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker to reach the North Pole; the first private 727
              expedition jet trip in 1991 to remote kingdoms in Africa. Peter has also served as a
              consultant in developing itineraries and educational tours for a number of tour
              companies, including Special Expeditions (now Lindblad Expeditions), Clipper Cruise
              Line, TCS Expeditions, and Zegrahm Expeditions. In addition, he has served as a
              consultant to the National Geographic Society and the Discovery Channel in the
              development of their travel programs.</p>
                  <p>At a celebration of Peter Voll's career, shortly before his untimely death in 2012,
              Linda Burek of Palo Alto's Criterion Travel declared, "The program Peter developed (at
              Stanford) is the strongest in the business. It was ahead of its time. Now it's the
              mainstream. He set the benchmark. He brought everybody up." Steve Ridgeway, who looked
              upon Peter Voll as a mentor and with Voll helped establish Educational Travel
              Consultants, an annual conference of travel providers, said, "He really was a
              trailblazer."</p>

                  <p>Weiler begins the interviews by clarifying that, although he began his career as a
              political scientist with a particular interest in Africa, he has had a foot in two
              camps at Stanford--the School of Education (later renamed the Graduate School of
              Education) and the Department of Political Science. He describes how he came to
              Stanford, citing the efforts of Professor of Education Paul Hanna, a visionary in
              international development education, and what Stanford was like in the mid-1960s.
              Weiler talks about Hanna’s role in the creation of the Stanford International
              Development Education Center (SIDEC) and the change in its leadership. He describes
              the interesting and significant work he did at SIDEC and the influential educators the
              center produced when its students went back to their home countries in Africa and
              Asia. He notes the connections that he developed in the field when he was on leave
              from Stanford for three years to direct the International Institute for Educational
              Planning, a UNESCO organization in Paris. He discusses his involvement with the Center
              for European Studies at Stanford and the challenge to area studies as a legitimate
              field.</p>
                  <p>Weiler recounts other career milestones, including two very critical years in the
              1980s as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the School of Education, when he
              placed graduate student funding in Education on a firm footing for the first time.
              Another milestone was his gradual transition out of African studies and into European
              studies amidst post-colonial reverberations in Africa and the reunification of Germany
              in 1989. Weiler recalls his work in remaking higher education in what had been East
              Germany, which eventually led to his early retirement from Stanford and becoming the
              first president of Viadrina. There, during two terms and in the face of various
              challenges, he tried to apply lessons regarding best practices in university education
              and administration he had learned at Stanford and in his research.</p>
                  <p>Weiler goes on to talk about his retirement from Viadrina and taking on a unique
              task--the conceptualization and realization of the Hertie School of Governance, the
              first privately funded public policy institution in Germany. He recalls his decision,
              after nurturing the Hertie School to prominence, to come back to Stanford, and to the
              challenge/opportunity that he is still discharging, that of Stanford’s Academic
              Secretary. In addition to explaining his own role, Weiler discusses the origin and
              development of Stanford’s strong faculty governance system, the Faculty Senate, though
              he muses that it may be in need of redefinition at this point. He comments on the
              changes at Stanford since the 1960s, in particular the expansion of the university’s
              administration, the “gentrification” of the university, changing campus architecture,
              and the re-emergence of student activism.</p>
                  <p>Having shared recollections of his career, Weiler talks about what it was like to
              grow up in Nazi Germany, describes his initial pursuit of Jesuit priesthood, and
              recounts his experience in the newly independent countries of Africa in the late 1950s
              that culminated in his devotion to African studies.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Weiler compares Stanford and US higher education to European higher
              education, noting the ironic decline of liberal arts education in America at a time
              when it is gaining popularity in Europe and commenting on recent efforts in American
              postsecondary education.</p>

                  <p>Irving “Irv” Weissman is a developmental biology professor at Stanford, where he is
              the Virginia &amp; D.K. Ludwig Professor for Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research
              and the director of Stanford’s Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
              Medicine. He was instrumental in the isolation and characterization of the first
              blood-forming stem cells, which give rise to all blood and immune cells in the body,
              and the cancer stem cells found in leukemia. In addition to his research activities,
              he founded three stem cell therapy companies, was involved in the formation of the
              California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), and served on the National
              Academy of Science’s panel on human cloning in 2001. He earned his medical degree from
              Stanford University School of Medicine in 1965 and has held an academic position at
              Stanford since 1969.</p>
                  <p>Weissman begins the interview by recounting his childhood in Great Falls, Montana and
              relating how, as a high school student, he was mentored by organ transplant pioneer,
              Ernst Eichwald. He describes his undergraduate studies at Montana State College and
              the research opportunities he had access to as a student in Stanford’s five-year
              medical school program.</p>
                  <p>Weissman conveys his excitement with the immunology research done at Stanford in the
              1960s, focusing on Henry Kaplan’s work with leukemia and the thymus, which led to
              Weissman’s own research focus. He recounts the experience of attending a meeting at
              the New York Academy of Sciences where James Gowans presented his findings on
              lymphocyte development, and the research he did in Gowans’s lab in Oxford to prove
              that lymphocytes migrate to the thymus where they develop into T-cells.</p>
                  <p>His research experiences, Weissman says, led to petitioning Stanford dean Sidney
              Raffel to allow him to forgo his residency requirements in order to take a position in
              Kaplan’s lab, which led to his appointment as an associate professor in the Pathology
              Department. He describes the experiments that led him to conclude that T-cells mount
              an immune response to viruses through activation of a cell surface receptor. Weissman
              also speaks about his professional and social connections to his research
              collaborators, Ronald Levy and Leroy Hood.</p>
                  <p>Weissman discusses events that could have set back his career: his decision to
              publically oppose the Vietnam War draft, and his then-controversial receptor-mediated
              leukemia hypothesis, which nearly caused him to be passed over for tenure.</p>
                  <p>He discusses his work with Mike McEwan on creating a humanized mouse to study HIV
              infection and blood-forming stem cell regeneration, and the legal and bureaucratic
              obstacles that led them to form the company Systemix to continue this research.</p>
                  <p>Weissman explains his support for translating scientific discoveries for use in drug
              development and cancer treatment and goes into detail about the technologies, funding,
              business strategy, and politics of the many companies--DNAX, Systemix, Sandoz Pharma,
              Novartis, Cellerant Therapeutics, StemCells Inc., and Amagen--in which he has played a
              role. He speaks about a specific clinical trial that used isolated blood-forming stem
              cells in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, defends its findings, and speaks
              optimistically about a new Stanford clinical trial to confirm the original results. He
              also discusses his work with Mike Clarke and Steve Quake to identify and isolate
              cancer stem cells and the underlying biology of how a blood-forming stem cell turns
              cancerous.</p>
                  <p>Weissman talks about serving on the human cloning panel and the reasons behind the
              panel’s conclusion that, at the time, clinical cloning was unacceptable but that
              research on nuclear transfer to create embryonic stem cell lines should continue.
              Following the Bush administration’s decision to follow the panel’s recommendation on
              the former but not the latter, Weissman recounts his involvement in the pushback that
              resulted in California’s Proposition 71 and the formation of CIRM. He details the
              legislation he helped to write that regulates how CIRM handles grants, clinical
              trials, and industry collaboration.</p>
                  <p>He goes on to discuss his CIRM CD47 clinical trial, explaining the research
              characterizing the cell surface marker done with Ravi Majeti, why they decided to
              partner with England’s Medical Research Council and Oxford University, and how CD47
              communicates a “Don’t eat me” signal to immune cells.</p>
                  <p>Weissman explains how he came to head the Institute of Stem Cell Biology and
              Regenerative Medicine and discusses two recent hires: Hiro Nakauchi and Maria Grazia
              Roncarolo. He concludes the interview with his thoughts on the changes at Stanford
              during the past fifty-two years, and how his time at Stanford has influenced him.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>Robert L. White, the William E. Ayer Professor of Electrical Engineering and
              Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Emeritus, chaired the Stanford
              Department of Electrical Engineering from 1981 to 1986. He is an expert on the medical
              electronics of the artificial ear, magnetic materials, and the atomic origins of
              magnetic properties. In this two-part oral history, he reminisces about his childhood
              in Plainfield, New Jersey and offers memories of his public school education and his
              parents and siblings. He also discusses his experience at naval radio training school
              during World War II and his undergraduate education at Columbia College, which he
              pursued with the help of scholarships and the G.I. Bill.</p>
                  <p>White recalls his experience at graduate school at Columbia University where his
              advisor was physicist Charles H. Townes. He describes Townes’s personality, his system
              for training graduate students, and the intense work regimen of graduate school. White
              also describes his thesis on microwave spectroscopy and gases and the apparatus on
              which he performed his research. White explains how he met his future wife, Phyllis
              Arlt, when they were both in high school and how their relationship evolved while he
              was studying at Columbia. </p>
                  <p>White recounts the positive post-WWII conception of physicists and the rich job
              market available to physics PhDs. He discusses his recruitment by Hughes Research
              Laboratories in southern California, the management environment there, his research on
              magnetic materials, and the ironic consequences of another scientist’s successful
              research on the material, ruby. White also details his move to the laboratories of
              General Telephone &amp; Electronics (GTE) in Palo Alto. He recounts his team’s
              discovery of a red phosphor useful in color television technology and the difficulties
              the company encountered in having two laboratories--one in Bayside, New York and the
              other in Palo Alto, California.</p>
                  <p>White relates his decision to leave industrial research for academia and the factors
              that influenced his decision to join Stanford University’s School of Engineering,
              including his interaction with Fredrick Emmons Terman. He describes the growth and
              character of the Electrical Engineering Department, the process of obtaining grant
              funding, the benefits of academia for family life, and a memorable sabbatical at
              Oxford University.</p>
                  <p>White discusses the shift in his research agenda around 1970 when he began to work on
              the development of a cochlear prosthesis or cochlear implant for the deaf. He
              describes the engineering challenges involved, the way his group’s device worked, and
              interactions with other groups doing similar research. He also recounts the resistance
              to his work on cochlear implants from some segments of the deaf community.</p>
                  <p>Reflecting on his chairmanship of the department, White describes the factors he
              looked for when admitting graduate students, how faculty recruitment worked, the
              changing student population, and some of the memorable faculty and alumni of the
              department, including John Hennessy, James H. Clark, and William Shockley. White
              describes teaching quantum mechanics to engineers and his approach to mentoring
              engineering graduate students. He also discusses the impact that the founding of the
              Integrated Circuits Laboratory had on the department and describes how he handled the
              situation when Vietnam War protestors visited the department.</p>
                  <p>White comments on the time he spent as director of the Exploratorium, an interactive
              science museum in San Francisco, and he describes his involvement with the early
              venture capital industry in Silicon Valley as an investor in and consultant for the
              Mayfield Fund. He concludes the oral history with a description of what his company,
              MagArray, Inc., is working to accomplish and some reflections on his career at
              Stanford.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this 2016 oral history, Gavin Wright, Stanford University’s William Robertson Coe
              Professor in American Economic History, Emeritus, discusses his family background, his
              political organizing activities during the 1960s and 1970s, and his research
              interests, especially in the economy of the American South. Wright provides an
              eyewitness account of the development of Cliometrics, or the New Economic History, and
              describes his experiences as a faculty member and chair in the Department of Economics
              at Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Briefly describing his suburban childhood in a Quaker family, Wright says he brought
              an interest in history to Swarthmore College, where he discovered economics. He speaks
              about his engagement with civil rights issues during this period and highlights two
              summer projects in which he participated. The first was a 1963 voting registration
              project in North Carolina, sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee. Wright
              explains that it raised questions that eventually culminated in Sharing the Prize
              (2013), his award-winning analysis of the economics of the civil rights movement in
              the South. In 1964, a Swarthmore project to inform an integrated group of local
              teenagers about opportunities for college education introduced him to his future wife,
              Cathe. He shares a vivid memory of one instructor in the program, Fred Hargadon, who
              later became a legendary dean of admissions at Stanford.</p>
                  <p>Turning to his doctoral studies at Yale University, Wright discusses his opposition
              to the Vietnam War, his support for the presidential candidate, Eugene McCarthy, and
              his involvement in local New Haven politics, especially the effort to elect Hank
              Parker as mayor. He attributes his choice of economic history as a career field to
              Yale professor William Nelson Parker, whose research project in North Carolina
              provided data for Wright’s dissertation project. Characterizing the key players in the
              emerging field of Cliometrics, he describes how his research involved him in debates
              over the emerging methods of quantitative analysis and controversies surrounding the
              economics of slavery and Fogel and Engerman’s book, Time on the Cross.</p>
                  <p>Wright describes the first decade of his career at the University of Michigan, where
              he continued to investigate the economic history of the South and where his family
              enjoyed a “golden age” of sorts, given the presence of other faculty families with
              young children there. He talks about his rationale for moving to the Stanford faculty
              in 1982, commenting especially on the strength of the graduate students here. He
              explains his involvement with the publication of the Historical Statistics of the
              United States and research with Paul A. David that attributed the technological
              leadership of the United States not so much to having natural resources as to knowing
              how to exploit them.</p>
                  <p>Focusing on the Department of Economics, Wright discusses its culture, his two terms
              as department chair, fund-raising and physical plant issues, and the visit of Soviet
              leader Mikhail Gorbachev to campus. Wright also reflects on his teaching strategies,
              the popularity of the economics major, and the unequal representation of women in
              economics. Recalling work on campus committees, he gives special attention to changes
              in student evaluation processes, the East Asian Library, the growth of the Summer
              Institute for High School Economics Teachers, and his role in averting the closure of
              Gunn High School.</p>

                  <p>Ernlé W.D. Young’s two-part interview covered many topics and times in his
              professional life. The first interview began with his early education in South Africa
              and early employment in his uncle’s printing business. From there, his education took
              him to Chicago and Dallas, studying theology and theologians. His return to South
              Africa began his long effort to counteract Apartheid from his position as a minister,
              work which eventually got him in trouble with the government, causing Young and his
              family to flee to the United States. It was at this point that he began his work at
              Stanford, working as a chaplain for the university hospital, a minister for Memorial
              Church, and an instructor in bioethics at the medical center. </p>
                  <p>Both interviews spent a great deal of time examining Young’s position in and
              relationship with the university, especially as related to his lifelong focus on
              morals and ethics. The discussion encompassed his service on various committees,
              including the Disinvestments and Divestments Committee, the Chaplaincy Advisory
              Committee, the Physicians Well-Being Committee, and the Medical Center Ethics
              Committee. Young discussed his efforts, frustrations, and hopes regarding the ethics
              curriculum of the Medical School, especially his hope that Stanford will someday offer
              a graduate degree program in bioethics. The two-part interview as a whole illustrates
              Young’s relationship with the Stanford University administration and his relentless
              efforts to make the world more considerate and more just.</p>

                  <p>Judy Sterling Plunkett, the youngest of three children of Wally and Ann Sterling,
              moved to Stanford with her family at age 5. She speaks fondly about growing up in
              Hoover House and reminisces about both of her parents, the house itself, house staff,
              childhood activities, and the family dog. She mentions discussions with her father
              about campus disruptions in the 1960s at the end of his presidency.</p>

                  <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
                  <p>Judith Sterling Plunkett, the youngest child of Stanford President J. E. Wallace
              Sterling, spent much of her childhood on Stanford Campus, living in Hoover House. She
              grew to know the Hoover House and Stanford support staff, from the Hoover House butler
              to the owner of Piers Dairy, and became known to the Stanford population in general as
              “Wally’s Dolly.” Because President Sterling’s position required a great deal of
              entertaining, Plunkett frequently found herself, while still a child, at formal
              dinners with a variety of notables and Stanford donors. She and her sister and brother
              all attended Stanford Elementary School.</p>
                  <p>Judith Plunkett eventually attended Stanford University for her BA and then for a MAT
              from the Stanford School of Education. She used the degree to teach, but also branched
              out into wider efforts for social service. Her resume demonstrates a passion for
              social improvement, including work to improve public health, human services, and youth
              services in her community. She was also a public member of the Federal Advisory Board
              on Child Abuse and Neglect, and published articles on youth and families in Pasadena
              and the importance of children’s exposure to art.</p>
                  <p>More recently, Judith Plunkett has worked as Executive Director for the California
              Arboretum Foundation and as the Director of the Society of Fellows for the Huntington
              Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. Honors bestowed upon her include
              Stanford Cap and Gown, Outstanding Young Woman of America, Volunteer Service Award
              from Pasadena Council of Women’s clubs, and the Community Service Award for Exemplary
              Activist and Leader in Public Policy from the Alano Club.</p>

              in 1948, his role as an assistant in the newly established music department, and his
              subsequent responsibilities as the department administrator in 1957 - 1996. He
              addresses the changes in the music department during his years at Stanford through his
              retirement from the department. He talks about how he provided administrative and
              logistical support for numerous performances over the years, often moving equipment
              and instruments himself from storage areas to concert locations. </p>
                  <p>Planting reminisces about music department directors, professors, teachers,
              conductors, and concert performers, including Jan Popper, Leonard Ratner, Sandor
              Salgo, Loran Crosten, Albert Cohen and Wolfgang Kuhn. He also shares memories of
              places such as Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Braun Music Center, Cubberley Auditorium, The
              Knoll, and Memorial Auditorium. Planting talks about the relationships between the
              music department and other parts of the university, such as the School of Education
              and the School of Humanities and Sciences. He describes the development of the degree
              programs such as the D.M.A. (Doctor of Musical Arts). Other topics covered include
              visiting artists, Friends of Music, Committee on Public Exercises, Stanford Lively
              Arts and ASSU (Associated Students of Stanford University). He also talks about
              turning points in the history of the department: the establishment of the music
              department, having their own building (Dinkelspiel), and the effects of the BAP
              (Budget Adjustment Program) in the 1980s. Throughout, he discusses the issues between
              musicology (theory) and performance (conservatory) and how his expertise was utilized
              in the planning of both Dinkelspiel Auditorium and Braun Music Center. </p>
                  <p>John Planting’s second interview follows up on several topics discussed in the first
              interview. He describes the contributions of Wolfgang Kuhn in two areas: degree
              programs (M.A. plus Teaching Credential; D.M.A. plus Ed.D.) and community outreach
              (contacts with schools and the Summer Youth Orchestra). He continues with several
              other topics, including Woodpecker Lodge, Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Music Educators
              National Conference (significance to Stanford), and the Stanford jazz program. </p>

                  <p>The oral history interview with Tobias Wolff focuses on his experiences at Stanford
              University, first as a Stegner Fellow, then as a lecturer and graduate student, and
              finally returning some years later as a member of the faculty. Wolff covers the
              evolution of the Stegner Fellow program, the relationship of the Creative Writing
              Program to the English Department, the various faculty members and department heads
              who influenced him, and his own development as a mentor and faculty member. He
              discusses the Stegner Fellowship, Mirrielees Fellowship and Truman Capote Fellowship,
              and provides general comparisons of creative writing approaches and traditional and
              current approaches to English Literature. He also discusses the importance of giving
              and receiving feedback and criticism in a productive manner. He credits the Stegner
              Fellowship program with doing that for him.</p>
                  <p>Wolff describes the contributions of various people over the years in enhancing the
              quality of the Creative Writing Program and the Stegner Fellowship today. He concludes
              by mentioning his participation in collaborative, inter-departmental programs, such as
              Thinking Matters.</p>

               <p>The Stanford Athletics Oral History Project examines the evolution of Stanford
            University’s athletic program from the 1960s to the present day. The project endeavors
            to understand how the program went from “good to great,” illuminate the individuals and
            institutional factors contributing to program stability and change, and situate
            Stanford’s program in the broader context of collegiate athletics. Interviewees include
            former Stanford athletic directors, staff members, coaches, faculty athletic
            representatives, and alumni. The series consists of audio and/or video recordings and
            transcripts of oral history interviews conducted by the Stanford Historical Society Oral
            History Program beginning in 2016.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>In this oral history, Jean (Fetter) Chu, who served as Dean of Undergraduate
              Admissions at Stanford for seven years, discusses the relationship between admissions
              and athletics at the university.</p>
                  <p>Chu begins with an account of her own athletic career at Oxford University, playing
              “attack” on the varsity “net ball” team--a basketball forward in American English. She
              says it was a highlight of her time at Oxford, where women’s sports were not regarded
              as highly as men’s teams. She describes the distinction between men’s and women’s
              sports by noting that male athletes were awarded a Blue letter, while women got a
              half-letter or Half Blue.</p>
                  <p>At Stanford, Chu found herself in the athletics spotlight when she was named Dean of
              Undergraduate Admissions in 1984. Athletics coaches and alumni were extremely
              concerned that having a woman--and a British woman who had a PhD in physics--in the
              admissions role would negatively affect the athletic program. Chu recalls that one
              faculty member even felt the need to take her aside to explain--unnecessarily, of
              course--what the Pac-10 was.</p>
                  <p>Chu describes her great respect for the athletic coaches at Stanford as well as her
              determination to admit only students she was confident would succeed academically.
              That resolve, she says, led her to refuse admission to prized basketball recruit,
              Chris Munk. Her decision led directly to the angry resignation of basketball coach,
              Thomas Davis. She recalls the wave of criticism she received and reviews the factors
              she weighed when making her decision.</p>
                  <p>Chu turns from the Munk incident to describe her strong belief in the need to
              maintain the integrity of the admissions process. She provides a sense of the constant
              observation she was under from coaches, high school counselors, faculty, and alumni;
              the unfounded rumors that tended to swirl around the admissions process at Stanford;
              and both the opposition and support she experienced in the role. She describes the
              important role that the admissions liaisons to the Department of Athletics played in
              screening potential recruits and addresses concerns that these staff members might
              become too closely personally with coaches they befriended. The emotional agony of the
              admissions decision-making process, she confesses, and the changes it was making in
              her personal outlook, were important factors in her decision to resign the
              position.</p>
                  <p>She credits faculty athletic representatives with helping her navigate the
              occasionally stormy seas and discusses her service on a committee that selected
              football coach Denny Green. Chu concludes with some kudos for the many star athletes
              who spent time at Stanford and shares some remarks and anecdotes related to the
              Stanford Band.</p>

                  <p>In this oral history, Linda Meier, a Stanford University alumna, former trustee, and
              a dedicated university leader and benefactor, provides anecdotal details and
              reflections on some of the iconic Stanford fundraising and outreach events that she
              spearheaded. She also discusses her student days at Stanford, the essential elements
              of her career in philanthropy and fundraising, and lessons learned during a lifetime
              committed to volunteer leadership.</p>
                  <p>Born and raised in Los Angeles, Meier credits her interest in volunteerism to her
              parents, her study of sociology at Stanford, her strong motivation, and a desire to
              make an impact. In high school, she volunteered at inner-city camps and became
              involved in student government and the honor society. As a young mother, Meier
              volunteered with the Junior League, as well as with her children’s schools and
              extracurricular activities.</p>
                  <p>Meier’s first major engagement with Stanford was in the formation and growth of the
              Cardinal Club, a group devoted to funding scholarships for women athletes. She
              describes the hurdles the group overcame, its innovative and successful fundraising
              events, and the strong impact it made. Meier describes other fundraising and outreach
              efforts in which she worked alongside some of the most important leaders in Stanford
              history, serving as either the chair or co-chair of events and programs. Such
              engagements include the 100th Big Game auction, the Centennial Campaign, the Stanford
              Challenge, and the Campaign for Undergraduate Education. She also describes her
              service on the Stanford Athletic Board, the boards of the Stanford University Hospital
              and the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, and the Stanford University Board
              of Trustees.</p>
                  <p>Through these experiences, Meier developed the concept of “friend raising,”
              essentially deepening the awareness and enthusiasm of alumni and volunteers around the
              world. She proved the positive connection between “friend raising” and fundraising,
              through such programs as Leading Matters, Think Again, and Humanities Forum. In
              addition, former colleagues recruited Meier to serve on the boards of local
              organizations, where for many years she was often a board’s only female member. Some
              of these enterprises include University National Bank and Trust, California Water
              Service Company, and the Peninsula Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired now
              called Vista. Meier built a reputation for producing successful events, creating a
              reliable constituency, and bringing women into leading advisory roles.</p>
                  <p>Meier comments that particularly challenging experiences, such as the Buck Club’s
              resistance to the Cardinal Club, lead to the best opportunities to be creative and
              have the most impact. She also deems it essential to choose strong personalities to
              work on purposeful ventures, in order to be successful. Meier credits the university
              presidents, provosts, the administrative personnel in the Alumni Association and
              Development Office, as well as her fellow volunteers, for the opportunities she was
              afforded. She feels privileged to have worked on great causes with such dedicated
              people over the course of her career.</p>
