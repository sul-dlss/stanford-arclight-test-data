         <p>Founders' Day celebration commemorates the founding of the University and the legacy of the
        Stanford family.</p>
         <p>The first public event sponsored by the newly fonned Stanfond Historical Society in 1976
        was a Founders' Day celebration held at the mausoleum on Tuesdar, March 9, in joint
        sponsorship with the Alumni Association. Reacting to the neglect of recent senior classes of
        the long-standing custom of maintaining flowers at the mausoleum, a large basket of flowers
        was placed in tribute. Prof. James T. Watkins IV, first president of the society, told those
        attending, that the society and the Alumni Association did not intend to usurp the
        University's traditional observance, which was part of the regular service in Memorial
        Church on the Sunday closest to Leland Stanford Sr.' s March birthday.</p>
         <p>Through 1979, the Historical Society and Alumni Association Continued their custom of
        observing Founders' Day at the mausoleum on March 9, hearing speeches by Rosamond Bacon,
        David Jacobson (secretary to the university emeritas), and other campus figures.</p>
         <p>In 1980, Founders' Day fell on a Sunday and the first joint celebiation with the University
        was organized with the help of Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamenon-Kelly. Following the
        traditional Sunday service, the Historical Society and Alunini Associauon sponsored a
        reenactment of the Founders' Day pilgrimage that once had been a traditional activity of the
        senior class. At the mausoleum, remarks were made by a senior class president and presidents
        of the Historical Society and Alumni Association.</p>
         <p>The joint Sunday celebration was a great success and has been the custom ever since with a
        faculty marshal leading senior class members carrying flags, followed by the church choir
        and anyone else who is interested in walking a mile. The Alumni Association provides the
        floral wreath and refreshments and the Historical Society arranges for a keynote speaker who
        gives brief remarks at the mausoleum that relate in some way to the founders. After the
        ceremony, participants ale permitted to go inside the mausoleum to view the crypts.</p>
         <p>Speakers for the Historical Society have included Don Kennedy (several times), Jim Rosse,
        Condoleezza. Rice, Gerhard Casper, and JimGibbons. As a courtesy, the dean of the chapel
        traditionally consults the Historical Society about the selection of a church speaker for
        Founders' Day, but that choice ultimately is theirs.</p>
         <p>Over the years, rounders' Day has provided an opportunity for special celebrations. In
        1984, those gathered at the mausoleum also recognized the 100th anniversary of Leland Jr.' s
        death. In 1985, the centennial celebration was launched on March 9 with a joint Historical
        Society/Cenrcnnial Committee program marking the 100th anniversary of the Enabling Act that
        provided the legal basis for the University's founding. The next day drew a
        larger-than-usual crowd to Founders' Day, where Don Kennedy discussed the skepticism and
        ridicule the Stanfords faced in 1885. (As occasionally happens, the procession that year was
        rained out and the mausoleum ceremony was held in the church.)</p>
         <p>The largest commemomion was held in 1991, when a capacity audience of 1,700 gathered in
        Memorial Auditorium to hear Wallace Stegner talk at a special centennial edition of
        Founders' Day. (Memorial Church would have been used but was closed because of the 1989
        earthquake.) Other speakers in 1991 were Richard Lyman, Don Kennedy, Don Winbigler, and
        Senior Oass President Jacqueline Yau. The 1993 Founders' Day, with Gerhard Casper speaking
        both in ihe pulpit and at the mausoleum, included tributes to the mausoleum's large dying
        heritage oak tree, which was scheduled for removal a few months later. Occasionally, the
        same person speaks both at the church service and the mausoleumy but Historical Society
        members generally prefer two different speakers.</p>
