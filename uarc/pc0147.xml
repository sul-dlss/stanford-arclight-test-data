         <p>Albert Brooks Cox was born in 1886 in Missouri. He received his BS in Electrical Engineering in 1909. Early in his career Cox worked for an electrical utility in Sacramento and the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona. During that time he began taking correspondence classes in law at night, graduating from the Hamilton College of Law in 1915. Cox married Mary Griffin in 1916. In 1917, he passed the Arizona Bar. That same year Cox joined the U.S. war effort, enrolling in the Second Officer's Training Camp at the Presidio in San Francisco. He went on to serve in France until the end of the war. Cox returned to Stanford following the war, earning his JD in1921. He practiced law in San Francisco prior to teaching at Tulane University from 1922-1928. Cox returned to San Francisco to practice law and terach nights at the San Francisco Law School. He was called back into service during World War II, serving as Regimental Commander and later Post Commander at the Signal Corps School at Camp Murphy, Florida. Cox was later transferred to the Legal Department of the Air Corps and sent to Dayton, Ohio to help in clearing up contracts for war materials. Following the war, he resumed his law practice and joined the faculty of Hastings, where he taught from 1946 until 1972. Cox's main subject was Contracts, although he also taught classes in Procedure, Constitutional Law, Negotiable Instruments, Criminal Law, Legislation, Muicipal Corporations, and Property. He retired from teaching in 1972. Cox died in 1974.</p>
