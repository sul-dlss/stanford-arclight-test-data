         <abstract label="Summary:">This scrapbook documents his years as a Stanford student, with a few items on his family, his high school years, and his postdoctoral years; it includes a large number of photographs with lesser numbers of clippings, programs, letters, postcards, and memorabilia including his 1922 Ph.D. diploma. Photographs and postcards of Stanford scenes include buildings, chemistry labs, 1914 Bonfire structure, Frosh-Soph tie-ups, LSJU mess hall 1918, card stunts at football games, and the Stanford band. Other images include Yosemite, the high Sierra country, Lake Tahoe area, airplane flying over football game at Berkeley (labeled "Beachey 1914"), two images of A. C. Kimber in front of a plane (1917 and 1918), and the Camp Fremont Song Festival [possibly the Patriotic Song Festival held in the Stanford Stadium, June 9, 1918]. There is also a marriage certificate for W. H. Schoonover and Mary Ann Wilkey [?] of Pennsylvania, 1865.</abstract>
