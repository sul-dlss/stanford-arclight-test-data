         <head>Biography</head>
         <p>Betty Grover Eisner (1915-2004), a clinical psychologist best known for her experiments
        with LSD and other psychoactive drugs, was born Helen Elizabeth Grover in Kansas City, MO.
        After completing high school in Kansas City, she attended Stanford University and earned a
        B.A. in political science in 1937. She volunteered with the Red Cross during World War II,
        then spent a year in the late 1940s traveling Europe, Asia, and Africa with her first
        husband, fellow Stanford graduate Will Eisner. She documented their trip in a series of
        columns published in the <title render="italic">Los Angeles Times</title>.</p>
         <p>Eisner earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Los
        Angeles, in 1956. She completed her dissertation on the psychology of infertile women, but
        by the time she graduated her primary professional interest had shifted to the use of LSD as
        an aid to psychotherapy. She conducted LSD experiments with Dr. Sidney Cohen at a Veterans'
        Administration hospital in Los Angeles, and later established a private psychotherapy
        practice in Santa Monica. After psychiatric research with LSD was banned in the United
        States in the late 1960s, Eisner experimented with using other drugs to promote
        psychological breakthroughs in patients, including ketamine and injectable Ritalin. Other
        treatments favored by Eisner included the inhalation of carbogen (a mix of 70% oxygen and
        30% carbon dioxide), hot mineral baths, massage, and "blasting," a technique in which a
        patient was encouraged to release hostility by yelling while muffled by a washcloth.</p>
         <p>In 1976, one of Eisner's patients died following mineral bath treatment and blasting
        therapy. A wrongful death investigation ensued, as well an ethics investigation by the
        American Psychological Association. The Psychology Examining Committee of the California
        Board of Medical Quality Assurance revoked Eisner's license to practice in 1978. Eisner
        twice attempted to have her license restored in the early 1980s. Both attempts were
        unsuccessful.</p>
         <p>Eisner was the author of <title render="italic">The Unused Potential of Marriage and
          Sex</title>, published in 1970, as well as an unpublished book based on her group therapy
        work, <title render="italic">I Can't, You Can't, But We Can</title>. During the late 1950s
        and early 1960s, she authored several journal articles and conference papers on her use of
        LSD and other drugs in psychotherapy In 2002, she wrote a memoir titled <title render="italic">Remembrances of LSD Therapy Past</title>. Although unpublished, this
        memoir is available on the World Wide Web. Eisner also wrote song lyrics in the 1970s under
        the pseudonym Rev. B. Later in life, she wrote poetry under the name Abigail Bradbury. She
        and her second husband, Bill Micks, helped to found the Center for Learning, a school for
        the teaching of English in Mexico.</p>

               <head>Series Description</head>
               <p>This series includes a variety of materials related to Eisner's early education,
            marriage, and family life. Included are report cards from Kansas City public schools and
            Stanford University and a scrapbook of Stanford Daily clippings which documents Eisner's
            involvement in campus life from 1933-1937.</p>
               <p>The correspondence in this series is of a highly personal nature, particularly the
            correspondence which documents Eisner's relationship with her first husband, Will
            Eisner, in the years immediately prior to his death from lung cancer in 1965. Betty's
            correspondence with Will's family is also intensely personal, discussing the couple's
            marital difficulties in detail.</p>
               <p>Also included is personal writing by Eisner, including a diary of dreams and free
            association writing, both of which appear to reflect her growing interest in psychology
            prior to enrolling in UCLA's clinical psychology Ph.D. program.</p>
               <p>There is also a subseries comprised of material created by or about Will Eisner. It
            includes correspondence, documentation of his employment at the Rand Corporation and
            SRI, personal writings on his experiences with psychotherapy, and documents related to
            his estate. </p>
               <p>A second subseries contains materials related to a year-long trip taken by Will and
            Betty Eisner in 1948 and 1949. Destinations included Europe, India, and Egypt. During
            this trip, letters that Betty ostensibly wrote to her family were published as a <title render="italic">Los Angeles Times</title> column titled "Travel Letter from Betty."
            Included in this series are complete manuscripts for these columns and a scrapbook with
            newspaper clippings of the published column. There are also letters from Will Eisner to
            his family while abroad, correspondence documenting a dispute over money that was seized
            from the Eisners at the Indian border, and Betty's correspondence with met while
            traveling.</p>

               <p>The bulk of this series consists of journal articles, conference papers, and other
            professional writing by Eisner. Most of these works have been published, although some
            are unpublished manuscripts. There is also a copy of a manuscript for Eisner's book
              <title render="italic">The Unused Potential of Marriage and Sex</title> (published
            1970) and an unpublished manuscript based on Eisner's experiences with group therapy
            titled <title render="italic">I Can't, You Can't, But We Can</title>.</p>
               <p>Later in life Eisner pursued creative writing and composed poetry under the name
            Abigail Bradbury. Although there are no examples of her poetry in this series, there are
            manuscripts of a series of fables, titled "New Fables for New Times," written by Eisner
            in the early 1990s.</p>

               <p>This series consists primarily of Eisner's professional correspondence. However, since
            Eisner developed close friendships with many colleagues who shared her interest in LSD
            and other drug research, much of the content is of a personal nature. Some files also
            include clippings and other materials. Researchers should note the presence of
            additional correspondence in other series, particularly in Series 1: Family Papers.</p>

               <head>Series Description</head>
               <p>Files in this series relate to legal action against Eisner following a patient's death
            in 1976. In addition to the wrongful death investigation that followed, Eisner faced an
            ethics investigation by the California State Psychological Association and the American
            Psychological Association, as well as an investigation and hearing before the Psychology
            Examining Committee of the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance. As a result of
            this investigation, her professional license was revoked in 1978. At Eisner's request,
            relicensing hearings were held in 1980 and 1983. In both cases the Psychology Examining
            Committee refused to restore her license. This series includes copies of legal
            documents, correspondence, and other supporting material collected by Eisner.</p>
               <p>Also included is one file on a small claims court case filed against a patient in
            1973.</p>

               <head>Series Description</head>
               <p>The bulk of this series consists of Eisner's detailed narrative accounts of therapy
            sessions, the majority of which involved the use of LSD, ritalin, ketamine, and other
            psychoactive drugs. Early session reports include descriptions of Eisner's own use of
            these drugs; later, she focused on her experiences facilitating group therapy sessions
            in which participants were given drugs in an attempt to break through psychological
            barriers. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, these sessions increasingly incorporated
            other non-mainstream therapies, including mineral baths, "blasting" (a technique in
            which patients immersed in a mineral bath were encouraged to yell and scream while
            muffled by a washcloth), and massage.</p>
               <p>There is also a subseries related to Eisner's involvement with the Sequoia Seminar. The
            Sequoia Seminar was established by Stanford University Law professor Harry Rathbun and
            his wife, Emalia, in the 1930s. Its original goal was the study of historical records of
            the life of Jesus in a non-religious context. Many of Betty Eisner's early LSD subjects
            were Sequoia Seminar participants.</p>
