         <abstract label="Summary:">Collection contains two photograph albums belonging to Charles E. Hodges, resident draftsman and later architect at Stanford University. Volume 28.1 (ca. 1898-1905) contains images of Memorial Arch and its frieze; the Stanford University Inn; interiors and exteriors of faculty houses and fraternities, some of which are annotated with the name, cost, and date erected; Memorial Church under construction; the campus home of Mrs. Stanford's brother and business manager, Charles G. Lathrop; a cornerstone laying in the Quad (possibly the T. W. Stanford Library, 1898); cactus garden; and the front of the 1905 gymnasium (destroyed in the 1906 quake). Volume 28.2 contains photographs by Joseph Collier; Stanford subjects include the main quad (parts of which were still under construction), Memorial Arch, Roble and Encina dorms, the museum, the Stanford home and its grounds on campus, the cactus garden, interior of Escondite Cottage, John D. McGilvray with what may be representatives of Salviati and Co., and other views of campus. Non-Stanford subjects include the Flood estate, San Francisco buildings and private homes, and unidentified people. Volume 28.2 is inscribed to Hodges from John D. McGilvray, 1902; cover is embossed "Photographs J. Collier Denver."</abstract>
