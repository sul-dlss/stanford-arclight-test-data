         <p>George Kambara earned his A.B. at Stanford in 1937 and his M.D. in 1941, but was forced to leave his residency in 1942 and relocate to the Tule Lake internment camp. He was head of the eye, ear, nose and throat service there until he was accepted for a residency in Memphis in 1943. He finished his residency at the University of Wisconsin in 1946 and taught there until 1948 when he moved to Los Angeles to set up his practice in ophthalmology.</p>
