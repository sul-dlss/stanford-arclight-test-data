                  <p>The first part of this case describes the original control system and reasons for
              adding a variable-stability auxiliary system to the Bell X-14 experimental aircraft.
              By means of excerpts from the original project notebook, the student is provided with
              the technical requirements of the system. The second part includes the project
              notebook calculations for the first part and poses the additional problems of writing
              a preliminary progress report, designing a simulator for the control system, and
              drawing a block diagram of the control system. A brief instructor's note is

                  <p>Few people have seen the second largest stainless steel structure in the United
              States-the trashrack system for the Oroville Dam powerplant. The case details how
              stainless steel was substituted for mild steel. The substitution had to be justified
              on a superior function and lower cost basis, leading to a sophisticated analysis of a
              rather prosaic component. The case is interesting both as a technical achievement and
              as an example of the way engineering innovations are accomplished.</p>

                  <p>This case tells of an unusual application of the engineering method, the location of
              a missing bullet in a police case. The construction of the case is to show and to lead
              the student through the solution as carried out by Jorgen Vindum, the principal
              investigator. The case is divided into three parts: each section ends at a critical
              decision point and students can be asked to discuss the course of action to be
              followed. The case involves a mixture of technology, computer application, intuition,
              experimentation, logical thinking and plain luck. Instructor's Note is available.

                  <p>Most doors are held in a closed position by a system comprised of a retractable latch
              bolt located in the door edge and a strike plate fastened to the door frame, the plate
              being cut with a hole to receive the latchbolt. In 1963 Mr. Ernest L. Schlage,
              Director of Research at the Schlage Lock Company, undertook the design of a new
              circular strike plate which could be installed with a single boring operation rather
              than the hand chiseling or routing required with the traditional rectangular strikes.
              Part A of the case includes background on the components of the Schlage cylindrical
              lock and design requirements for the new strike. Part B describes the steps taken
              which resulted in the design and introduction of a circular strike meeting these
              requirements. Parts C and D deal with the refinement and modicication of Schlage's
              original design which led to production of an adjustable circular strike.</p>

              produce its cracking sound. Orders for thousands of these rifles had been received and

              clutch springs began to break on the first batch of 100 guns which had been assembled
              from production parts. Mr. Harvey LaBrance, Director of Product Development
              Engineering, had to decide on a cure for the problem.</p>

                  <p>Ground control stations are equipped with instrumentation for sending to a satellite
              commands controlling its functions. Technicians must be able to handle large numbers
              of such functions (Perhaps 100 for a typical satellite) from a single control panel.
              To accomplish this task Philco-Ford engineers had designed a device called POK (Page
              Overlay Keyboard) which consisted of an array of buttons plus overlays, or pages,
              which could adapt the panel to a variety of functions. Warren Deutsch, head of the

                  <p>In 1958 Mr. Howard Arneson, rather fortuitously, came across an idea for a device to
              clean swimming pools automatically. To pursue this idea further, he started a tiny
              company with $8,000 in 1960. By 1965 the device was in production and in 1969 his
              company had sales exceeding six million dollars. Mr. Arneson now heads the company he
              sold to Castle and Cooke Inc. for 9 million dollars in 1969. The case tells Mr.
              Arneson's story.</p>

                  <p>Drop Master is a device used for monitoring the rate of fluid administered
              intravenously. The device was invented and developed at Smith Kline Instruments Inc.
              After the Drop Master was put on the market, a number of service calls from the
              customers indicated that the device was too sensitive to temporary flow rate changes.

                  <p>Robert Kinner, a structural analyst, had been loaned to the undersea pipeline project
              to check the design of pipe bundles which drop down from a height of about 15 feet
              above the sea floor and are subject to several design constraints. He found that the
              pipes would buckle unless the design was changed and proposed a feasible design. When
              the project management doubted Rob's analysis he devised a very quick and inexpensive
              test to prove his assumptions. Part A outlines the problem. Part B shows Rob's
              solution. Part C show his tests and the associated calculations. The case is useful in

                  <p>Early in 1964 Dieter R. Walz, a member of the technical staff at SLAC, was placed in
              charge of developing a beam dump. This device is a heat exchanger capable of absorbing
              and dissipating the high energy electron beams which must be disposed of at the end of
              the 2 mile long accelerator. The case describes performance and maintainance
              requirements for the beam dump and tells how Walz proceeded with his design.</p>

                  <p>Scientists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center planned to mount a field
              strength detecting device inside the pipe through which the electron beam travels. The
              signal from this device would be passed through an amplifier mounted on the outside of
              the pipe, then transmitted to a remote oscilloscope. This brief case study describes
              the design and construction of a shield used to protect the amplifier from stray
              electromagnetic fields produced by power sources for the accelerator. Included as
              exhibits are the chassis layout and cover assembly drawings prepared by Pete Demos,
              the designer assigned to the job.</p>

                  <p>The alignment within 1/8 inch of the two mile long Stanford Linear Accelerator
              presents problems in metrology and in structures. These are explained in part A. Part

              girders which carry the support tube. This interconnection permits adjustment of the

                  <p>Rock drills are used in mining, in excavating, and in other applications where it is
              necessary to remove hard rock. The drills produce holes into which blasting charges
              are later inserted. These holes may be as shallow as a few feet or as deep as one
              hundred feet. Depths of fifty feet are common. The holes are produced by a bit which
              is attached to one end of the drill rod (or steel). A pneumatic hammer hits the other
              end of the drill steel, through a so-called shank piece. The drill steels themselves,
              each about ten feet long and one and a half inches in diameter, are threaded at both
              ends and joined by couplings. This case study provides some background on the drilling
              process and the characteristics of existing drill steels, then traces the development
              of an improved drill steel.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Chet Arnessen, a young employee of Beckman Instruments, was asked to redesign
              part of the buffer pump of his company's Model 130 Spectrochrom Analyzer. A few of
              Beckman's customers had complained that the moving seals in this pump developed leaks
              after very little use; these complaints were reaching the company at the rate of one
              or two a month with some repeats. Beckman's customers were scattered all over the
              world and, since the Spectrochrom Analyzer is not portable, the company had to send
              its Field Service personnel to them to make whatever repairs were necessary.</p>

                  <p>Intended for freshman orientation, this case dealing with design of a means to weigh
              a man in space has also been used successfully at graduate level. The analytic problem
              faced by Mr. Whiting at the end of the case is to determine the man's mass from
              Newton's second law from stopwatch experimental data. The question then is what to do
              about the fact that the accuracy is not quite satisfactory. Teaching objectives are
              similar to ECL 58, namely, to let the freshman see that his elementary science applies

              cracks in the concrete base. Mr. Don Brown, a mechanical engineer, undertook to

                  <p>This case relates a number of instructive events from the development of the highly
              successful Explorer satellite. It was designed to spin about its axis of minimum
              moment of inertia at a rate of about 700 RPM. But anomalies in the signals received
              from its antenna led to the conclusion that after about one orbit it changed to a
              rotation about its axis of maximum moment of inertia at a rate of about 120 RPM.
              Background and observed data are given in Part I. A dynamic analysis which explains
              the behavior is presented in Part II. Other interesting dynamic phenomena observed in
              the Explorer are discussed in Part III. The historical background is given in Part IV,
              documented by extracts from periodicals. The case includes a note for Instructors.</p>
