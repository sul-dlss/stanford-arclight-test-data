         <abstract label="Summary:">Collection pertains to research Winkler did in preparation for his biography of W. Y. Evans-Wentz. The photocopied source materials on Evans-Wentz include his letters to Lama Govinda, 1955-62; his "Notes for an Autobiography" 1920; one letter from Carl Jung, 1950; several published articles by Evans-Wentz; and the diary of Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup (in English and Tibetan) 1894. Winker's papers include letters received, 1979-93; three notebooks on his research, 1977-86; two of his published articles on Evans-Wentz; and the copyright certificate for his book PILGRIM OF THE CLEAR LIGHT. Correspondents include John Blofeld, Lama Anagarika Govinda, Peter Matthiessen, and T. T. Samdup (son of Lama Kazi Dawa-Samdup who worked with Evans-Wentz). The collection also includes an audiotape of recollections of Evans-Wentz by Warren Ault, who knew him when he was at Oxford (1907-08); and photographs of Evans-Wentz, the houses he lived in, scenes in Almora (India) in 1979, and Mount Cuchama, property near San Diego that Evans-Wentz owned.</abstract>
