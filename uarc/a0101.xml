         <abstract label="Summary:">This album contains photographs, postcards, clippings, and programs largely pertaining to his student days at Stanford. Subjects include campus views including some prior to the 1906 earthquake, interior and exterior views of Memorial Church (also pre-1906), fraternity houses, student amusements including frosh-soph tie-ups, bonfires, the Stanford University Band, and rugby, track, and crew events. Of note are aerial views of the campus ca. 1920, an image of an asphalt truck working in the Inner Quad, and a plane flying low over the athletic field at UC Berkeley. There are also some images taken by the ocean, possibly from a class at the Hopkins Marine Station.</abstract>
