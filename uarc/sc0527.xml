                  <p>Parents, Paul and Jean Hanna, built home on Stanford University campus, 1936-37.
              Parents' bond with Frank Lloyd Wright. Midwesterners and children of Methodist
              ministers. John knew grandmothers. Parents' families lived near Fairmont, Minnesota.
              Paul born Sioux City, Iowa. Uncle Russell Hanna still lives Minnesota. Parents not
              religious. Maternal grandmother lived Palo Alto. Parents conservatives regarding
              smoking, drinking, dress. Typical faculty family. Suspicious of FOR. Not Midwestern
              but international perspective. Graduate study and teaching at Columbia University.
              World travel. Dad accused of being liberal because of authorship of textbooks.
              Supported UN. Economic conservative. Professor of education but not "schoolman." Broad
              outlook. Led by example. High expectations. Jean died at 84; Paul (born 1902), died
              85. Neither interested avant-garde. Interest music traditional. Jean played organ and
              piano. Not much interest visual arts because lack place to display paintings. House
              was piece sculpture. Mementos of travels. Attraction to Wright philosophical. Rented
              house on Waverly Street, Palo Alto. Not aware parents' wider knowledge of Wright.
              Suggest speak to sister, 18 months older, who lives Marin County. John born 1932.
              Earliest recollection house: cow pastures with castle on hill. Vague memories of
              construction. Visitors showed interest. Professors complained to President Wilbur.
              Father's financial risk and burden. Cost rose from $15k to $40k. 99-year lease of
              land. Income from book sales. Not Usonian house but gentleman's. Comparable house
              today cost $3 million. House could not have been bequeathed to family but parents
              could have sold rather than give to Stanford. Didn't believe inherited wealth. Gifts
              to alma mater, Hamline University, and Stanford's Hoover Institution. Parents full
              partners in marriage, though Paul boss. Paul dreamer and optimist. Book on house was
              joint effort. Parents serious not frivolous. Not emotional or outward display of anger
              or joy. Reserved and controlled. House profoundly shaped family life. Appreciation for
              quality of environment. House was central focus: an anchor. Binds children even now.
              Felt special. Used fireplace as symbol of home. Comfort. Parents never regretted
              house. Met Wright half-dozen times: charismatic and eccentric. Never talked to
              him.</p>

              difficult adversary. Parents lived in awe W. W could turn on charm. W recognized
              parents' intellect and open-mindedness. Also determination. Always believed W would
              take commission. Followed progressive architects, such as Mies. Parents wanted get
