         <p>The Stanford Center at Peking University represents the culmination of a long-term partnership between the two Universities. For over 30 years, Peking University and Stanford have sponsored faculty and student exchanges, as well as joint courses, research projects and conferences. Formal arrangements already exist between PKU and a growing number of Stanford programs including the Department of Asian Languages, Summer Chinese Language Program, Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, School of Engineering, School of Law, and the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. For the next quarter century, the Center will expand the PKU relationship by making it easier to grow established and initiate new collaborative programs between the two institutions to support activities and opportunities on both sides of the Pacific.</p>
