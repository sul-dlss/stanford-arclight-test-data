      <p>These records, together with those of the Justice Department of the Russian Army (Sudnoe Otdielenie Russkoi Armii), were previously accessioned at the Hoover Institution as the F. F. Abramoff collection. Both groups of records at one point were in the possession of General Abramoff, who commanded the Don Army Corps in Bulgaria, but he was not the originator of the records themselves. The office of the Chief of Supply was relocated in Bulgaria after the evacuation of General Wrangel's Russian Army from the Crimean Peninsula in 1920, and was responsible for the distribution of funds to the First Army Corps and the Don Army Corps, both of which were billeted in Bulgaria after 1922. General Abramoff probably assumed possession of the files of the Chief of Supply after many of the Russian Army organizations and offices disintegrated in 1926-1927 because of the acute shortage of funds.</p>
      <p>The duties of Lieutenant-General Peter P. Stavitskii, who held the office of Chief of Supply from 1922 to 1926, centered upon the disbursement of funds to needy soldiers and their families, particularly invalids, war widows and orphans, and upon the control of expenditures for barracks, staff and office expenses, military schools and lyceums, Red Cross hospitals, and various military organizations, such as the Medical Department. Most of the material concerns army organizations in Bulgaria (specifically, the First Army Corps and the Don Army Corps) during the period 1922-1926. However, the Chief of Supply was also responsible for the distribution of funds to army organizations in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, including General Headquarters in Belgrade.</p>
