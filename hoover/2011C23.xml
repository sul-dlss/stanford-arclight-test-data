<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Soviet intelligence officer; defector to the United States; parapsychology researcher.</p>
<p>Working for the KGB, Khokhlov was sent to Germany in 1954 to assassinate the head of the anti-Soviet &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; organization NTS. He declined to carry out his mission and defected to the West, where he wrote his memoirs and became a specialist in Soviet military espionage and psychology. Khokhlov taught at California State University at San Bernardino from 1968 to 1992. He died in 2007.</p>

Khokhlov </unittitle><unitdate>17-30 April 1993</unitdate></did><scopecontent><p>These sound recordings contain the only surviving excerpts from a series of lectures delivered by the late Professor Nikolai E. Khokhlov at a conference on spiritual life held at the St. Gregory Palamas Monastery in Etma, California, between April 17 and April 30, 1993 (Old Style). Dr. Khokhlov was the keynote speaker and delivered three lectures on the Soviet Union's battle with the Russian Orthodox Church and Soviet interest in para-psychological forces and evil in forming the new "Soviet man," who was to be without religious beliefs. In these excerpts, Professor Khokhlov discusses his work in parapsychology in the Soviet Union and at Duke University, as well as the interest of U.S. intelligence agencies, with whom he collaborated, in parapsychological phenomena. The CDs constitute an interesting overview, in Khohlov's own words, of his ideas on science, religion, and the Soviet experience. (Description from note in CD case. Consists of 2 audio CD-Rs.)
