            <p>William G. Kubick was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved with his family to California in 1922, when he was eight. In 1942, Kubick joined the United States Army and participated in landings throughout the Pacific. He was among the first United States occupation forces who participated in assault landings on Japan.</p>
            <p>In 1981, Kubick testified before the Seattle hearing of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) as a veteran of World War II. Kubick became known as an opponent of reparations payments to Japanese Americans interned during World War II and continued to voice his support for President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 in 2000.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The W.G. Kubick papers consist of materials created and compiled by Kubick on the topic of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II in preparation for Senate hearings in Seattle in 1981 on the Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. These materials include writings, correspondence, testimony, photographs, printed matter, and photocopies of United States government documents from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
            <p>The collection also documents Kubick's later involvement in writing about reparations and appearing on broadcast shows. These materials include documentation of Kubick's television and radio appearances, as well as articles and letters to the editor in support of the United States' relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps. Senate Bill S. 2116 and House Bill H.B. 442, regarding civil liberties violations and reparations, are also included in the collection.</p>
            <p>Kubick's original order has been maintained.</p>
