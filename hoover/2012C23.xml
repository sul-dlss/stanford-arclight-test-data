<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Max Koppelmann was a Russian Jewish &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; in Germany. He was born in the Russian Empire (Mogilev) in 1882 and lived in Moscow and St. Petersburg prior to the turn of the century. In 1901 he became a student at the Warsaw Polytechnic. Between 1907 and 1914 he was involved in the family business: grain trade and breweries. In the course of the First World War, Koppelmann engaged in the production of munitions. Koppelmann left Russia during the Civil War and settled in Berlin (by 1921), where he lived until 1936, at which time he left Germany altogether. </p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p> The memoirs concern Jewish life in Russia, the revolutionary movement in the early 1900s (especially student attitudes), and the 1917 revolution. For the 1920s and 1930s, the memoirs detail the growing difficulties Jews experienced in Germany. A good portion of the memoirs is devoted to the author's 1935 trip to Palestine, which he describes in great detail.</p>

<note><p>Edited and translated from the German by Gabrielle Kopelman, with one section translated from the Russian by Julia Kosich. Note on page one: "There are two extant manuscripts of the memoirs of Max Kopelmann--one in German, the other in Russian (Cyrillic). Both manuscripts have been donated to the 42St. N.Y. Public Library's Slavonic Division. The German ms. has been translated into English by Gabrielle Kopelman, and excerpts from this English translation have been published in <emph render="italic">Revolutionary Russia</emph>. For the most part, with only minimal differences, the chronology and material of the Russian ms. run parallel to the German one. The exception, (see The Years 1933-36, p.97-142) translated by Julia Kosich, deals with a period in  M.K.'s life in the Thirties, not found in the German ms."

<note><p>Max Koppelmann's older son, Alexander Kopelmann, was tried and sentenced as a communist in Berlin in 1937, and at the end of his sentence in 1942, was killed in Mauthausen. Note on page one: "The following is an account of the fate of Max Koppelmann's oldest son, Alex, as far as I--Gabrielle Kopelman--know it either by my own recollections, by way of hearing about it from my parents, or from the memoirs of  Max Koppelman. MK's two original manuscripts of his memoirs, one in Russian, one in German, are now in the Slavonic Department of the NY 42 Street Public Library. In 1962, Alex's family in Israel published a small book of Alex's letters from prison, in the original German and in Hebrew. I have a copy, and so does the Leo Beck Institute."
