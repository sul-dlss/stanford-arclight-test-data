<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>These sound recordings, which relate to conditions in Afghanistan, were created by Akbar during his trips to Afghanistan. The cassettes were generated from his first trip in summer 2002, and the MindiDiscs came from his following trip, in 2003. The recordings of both trips were the basis for successive radio documentaries on Ira Glass's "This American Life" (Chicago Public Radio).</p>

He then contemplates the realities of a region at war, including the bombing of Kunar and casualties his family knows. This prompts him to look for news online. Following, he contemplates things he needs to do before he leaves including refreshing his skills with an Afghan alphabet and figuring out when he gets his high school diploma.

It sounds like he was on the phone with someone and this is a recording of his side. First is a person mentioned before, Julalie (sp?), Interior Minister of Afghanistan. Then he discusses an ad in an anti-Pasto newspaper for a press secretary. Prior to taking out the ad, those responsible didn't inform Akbar's father, who was the press secretary. Akbar notes his father is in Kunar in order to help confront the warlords and has since been attacked. Akbar lays out what he expects in his trip. In ways this trip will be different than his first the year before; he believes he will be better prepared, and he believes he'll be much more comfortable in Kunar than trapped in a Kabul hotel. He notes how the trip relates to his studies in college. He reflects on going to a community college versus a traditional college. He says Afghanistan is full of western-trained professionals, but that's a moot point due to political/war issues. He wants to use his education to do good for Afghanistan. For example, he's thinking about majoring in economics, as opposed to his previous focus on getting an MBA. During his comments, he reflects on the fact that he doesn't dream at night like he did as a child. He mentions the relationship between Kabul and the providences. He speaks about the importance of beards in Afghanistan. Label reads: Hyder Akbar   Kunar   Tape # 1   "Pre-Kunar 1." In English</p></scopecontent></c02>
