            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The papers document the career of Williamson M. Evers, a political scientist, editor, campaign manager for Libertarian presidential candidate David Bergland, Hoover Institution fellow, and member of the Koret Task Force on K-12 Education. The collection contains documents related to libertarian thought in the United States, activities of the Libertarian Party, Libertarian Party electoral campaigns, the establishment of academic standards for California public schools, and national educational policy in the United States. Although the collection has not been arranged into series, an index to major groups of material exists for this collection; however, not all materials are represented in these groups.</p>
            <p>Evers was a political science student at Stanford University, beginning his study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1966 and earning his Ph.D. from the university in 1978. His files document activism and student protests on the Stanford campus during the late 1960s and early 1970s, a time that saw ROTC recruitment at the university and the first use of police as a response to protests on the Stanford campus. During 1969, students protested weapons research conducted at the Stanford Research Institute. They adopted the name "April 3rd Movement" for their demonstrations, named after a series of meetings beginning on that date which led to a sit-in at the Applied Electronics Laboratory (boxes 18 and 19). The activism file documents this movement, as well as the case of H. Bruce Franklin, a Stanford professor who was fired based on charges of disrupting a speech delivered by Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and inciting an occupation of the Stanford Computation Center in 1971. Documents on the New Left and Students for a Democratic Society can be found in this file.</p>
            <p>Evers was a member of the Libertarian Party, joining the Libertarian National Committee in 1975 and becoming a member of that group's Publications Committee in 1977. The Libertarian file includes material on the Libertarian Party (especially the Libertarian Party of California), other Libertarian organizations, and materials from related groups, with letters from Murray Rothbard (box 68) and Libertarian Party founder David Nolan. The collection includes material on the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus and its publication Libertarian Vanguard, which ran Evers' "Bouquets and Brickbats" column. Evers was a board member for the Center for Libertarian Studies (CLS), an organization founded by Murray Rothbard and Burton Blumert in 1976. Documents from the Libertarian Scholars Conference, which was the origin of the CLS, can be found in this file. Also included are newsletters from various county and state Libertarian groups, as well as the files of Mary Gingell, who served as chair of the Libertarian Party of California and national vice chair of the Libertarian Party.</p>
            <p>In 1980, Evers campaigned as the Libertarian Party candidate for the House of Representatives in the 12th Congressional District of California, outpolling the Democratic candidate in San Mateo County. Evers took an anti-draft and anti-inflation stance in his campaign, arguing that cutting federal spending and balancing the budget would curb inflation. Materials from his campaign include campaign literature, correspondence, and voting research (boxes 6, 20-22, and 77).</p>
            <p>Evers was the campaign manager for David Bergland's 1984 presidential campaign. Documents from the Ed Clark presidential campaign of 1980 can be found throughout the Bergland campaign files (boxes 4, 6, 7-11, 13, 23, 55, 72, and 75).</p>
            <p>In addition to his activities in the Libertarian Party, Evers was involved in various education initiatives, including the creation of education standards for the state of California. From 1996 to 1998, Evers served on the California State Commission for the Establishment of Academic Content and Performance Standards, also known as the Academic Standards Commission, a group that developed California's first academic standards for grades K through 12. This file includes drafts of standards and materials related to the acceptance of those standards by the California State Board of Education.</p>
            <p>Evers was a member of the Honest Open Logical Debate (HOLD) on Math Reform, a group that argued against mathematics curriculum changes in the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD). This file includes material from HOLD that documents debates over math curriculum, as well as clippings, correspondence, and campaign literature related to school board elections.</p>
            <p>In addition to those groups, Evers was a member of the content review panel of the California 2005 History-Social Science Adoption, a program that led to the adoption of instructional materials aligning with content standards for history and social science education in California. Included in this file are instructional materials reviewed by this panel, such as textbooks from "Reflections: California Series" published by Harcourt School Publishers.</p>
            <p>The collection includes material on charter schools in California. Evers was president of the board of directors of the East Palo Alto Charter School from 1997 to 2004. This file includes meeting materials of the board and discussions of a merger with the Aspire Public Schools network. In addition, the Santa Clara County Office of Education file contains materials related to charter schools, such as charter petitions, as well as meeting materials of the Santa Clara County Board of Education.</p>
            <p>His work in education led Evers to become an education policy advisor to George W. Bush during Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, when Evers served on a transition advisory team. The George W. Bush administration and campaign file includes materials concerning Bush's education policy, as well as documents related to the 2000 presidential campaign.</p>
