      <head>Notes on Slide Sets</head>
      <p>These slides are arranged in sets of twelve, and each set is intended to be complete within itself, and to provide sufficient teaching material for one session. Twelve slides may seem very few to shew in one session, but a mistake frequently made is to shew too many slides at one time. Each picture is intended to be a peg on which teaching and discussion can be hung, and it is often useful to run through a set of slides a second time, getting a student to make the comments on the picture, or to question his fellow pupils.</p>
      <p>The notes which follow will need to be supplemented by the teacher, but it is hoped that enough information is given to indicate why the sets have been made up as they are.</p>
      <p>The sets could be used in a number of ways. They could be used as illustrative material for the initial teaching of a subject; or they could be used for revision purposes. Other combinations of pictures could be made, or one set amplified from another or with the teacher's own slides.</p>
      <p>These slide sets do not pretend to cover the history of Christianity in East Africa exhaustively, and there are many aspects which are ommitted altogether. The Department of Religious Studies is very grateful to all those who have helped to collect the material used here, and asks those who use it to help collect further useful illustrations.</p>

            <unittitle>Columns in the church at Apollonia, Cyrenaica. North Africa formed part of the Roman Empire, and was studded with cities built in the Roman style, many of whose ruins can still be seen. When Christianity became the religion of the Empire after Constantine, large churches were multiplied, often built in the style of Roman public buildings. In a number of places the marble columns of former pagan temples were reused, as is possibly the case here. The second half of the third century saw the beginnings of a mass conversion to Christianity.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>An aerial photograph of the ruins of Timgad, which shews clearly the ground-plan of the Christian basilica, ending in an apse, around which would be seated the Bishop and his clergy. Timgad was the greatest Donatist stronghold in Southern Numidia, and at the end of the 4th C the seat of the powerful Donatist bishop, Optatus, who was probably responsible for building one of the largest Cathedrals in Roman Africa, and a richly decorated baptistery.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>Coptic Christian textiles. Whereas the rise of Islam in the 7th C was virtually to wipe out Christianity in much of North Africa, in Egypt the Coptic Church, though reduced to a small minority, has nevertheless managed to survive down to the present. But the initiative in art passed largely to the Muslims.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>To the south of Egypt, above the First Cataract, lay Nubia. Christianity probably began to filter into Nubia in the 3rd C although the official conversion did not take place until the 6th C. This picture shews a pagan temple converted into a Christian church on the typical basilican plan, with seats for the clergy round the apse.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>The Cathedral at Faras has recently been excavated by a team of Polish archaeologists working under the auspices of U.N.E.S.C.O. since it was threatened with inundation by the waters of the High Aswan Dam. The archaeologists were amazed to discover a building whose walls were covered with frescoes, many in a Byzantine style of painting. One of the finest is shewn here - the Archangel Michael is protecting the three Israelites in the burning fiery furnace in the story from the book of Daniel.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>Also depicted on the walls of Faras Cathedral are kings, queens and bishops. Bishop Petros, shewn here, was Metropolitan from 973 -?999, the last of four bishops to hold the title of Metropolitan, whose episcopacies lasted about a century. The painting shews clearly that he was of Nubian, not Egyptian, stock.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>The conversion of Ethiopia took place in the 4th C. Later fugitive Syrian monks, Monophysites fleeing from persecution by the Orthodox, entered Ethiopia, and by their teaching and introduction of monasticism, set Ethiopian Christianity on a firmer footing. This picture shews the Nine Saints, as they are called, who were reputed to have gone to different parts of the country spreading Christian teaching.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>The Scriptures and liturgy were translated into Ge'ez, the local language, and although this is no longer intelligible to modern Ethiopians unless they are specially trained, it is still used in the liturgy and studied by the clergy. Many churches possess ancient mss books like this one here, which are richly decorated and beautifully written, and the Ethiopian Department of Antiquities is trying to conserve these.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>Among the oldest surviving churches in Ethiopia are the rockhewn churches of Lalibela. This picture shews the church of St George. Many country churches today are built of mud and wattle and the most common shape is circular, but even small churches may possess rich mss and vestments and other treasures.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>In the 15th C new contacts were made between Africa and the Christian world when Portuguese adventurers tried to find a way round the Muslim-ruled lands to the far East with its valuable trade. They undertook the responsibility of evangelising the peoples with whom they came into contact, though they did not always fulfil this obligation. Their most successful venture in evangelism in Africa was in the Kingdom of the Kongo (in modern Angola) and Christianity lasted here for about 300 years. In this picture an attempt is made to shew the Portuguese arriving in Kingo, and the first king to become a Christian, receiving baptism - he was called Johannes, that being also the name of the king of Portugal.</unittitle>

            <unittitle>The Kongo kingdom was slowly reduced in size and power, and the Portuguese were unable to keep up a regular supply of missionary priests because of their many commitments in Africa and the Far East, and because of sickness and death. By the 19th C when missionary work received a new lease of life, little remained of the once-flourishing Christianity of the Kingo. But crucifixes like this were found, being used as hunting charms by people who had forgotten their meaning. Only in Egypt and Ethiopia had the church remained strong.</unittitle>

              <unittitle>When the explorer H.M. Stanley visited the court of Kabaka Mutesa in <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1875 </unitdate>he found Islam' being taught. He therefore left a convert of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, Dallington Scopion Maftaa, who was one of his servants, to instruct the Kabaka in Christianity until Christian missionaries could arrive. Having a little knowledge of English, Dallington wrote a number of letters for the Kabaka which are still extant, including this one to General Gordon.</unittitle>

              <unittitle>Within a few years of the arrival of the Anglican Church Missionary Society and the Roman Catholic White Fathers, Mutesa died and was succeeded by his son, Mwanga. For a complex variety of reasons, basically political, the royal pages who were among the first converts to Christianity, found themselves the target of persecution which reached its climax when 32 were burnt at Namugongo on <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">June 3, 1886. </unitdate>This picture shews some of the martyrs, tied in mats of dried reeds as was the custom, being thrown on the execution pyre.</unittitle>

              <unittitle>Among the martyrs there was also a group from Rityana, whose leader was Noe Mawagali. His sister, seeing her brother done to death, told the executioners that she too was a Christian, but instead of being killed she was taken by the royal legate who wanted her as one of his wives. She was imprisoned when she refused him, and was redeemed by Pere Lourdel. She is the woman in this picture, clothed in traditional bark-cloth dress.</unittitle>

The missionaries were sent south of Lake Victoria, and this led to the founding of the Catholic Mission at Bukumi in Sukumaland.

              <unittitle>From <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1890 </unitdate>onwards people flocked to the missions to be instructed in the new religion. Catechists were soon being widely used to give elementary instruction for baptism, and to teach reading. Literacy was in great demand, and was normally a requirement for baptism. This catechist is shewn teaching letters and syllables from a reading sheet pinned up out of doors. Often a small mud and wattle chapel was used for prayers and catechism classes during the week, and for prayers on Sunday if the place was too far from the mission to attend church there.</unittitle>

              <unittitle>After the Christian revolution in Buganda requests were received from chiefs for Christian teaching to be given at their headquarters, and because of Buganda's diplomatic contacts whith neighbouring kingdoms, their rulers also were persuaded to ask for, or at least accept, Christian teachers. Among the first to do so was Kasagama, king of Toro, who was baptised by the C.M.S. in <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1896. </unitdate>He is seen in the centre of this picture. He did much to encourage the spread of Protestant Christianity in Toro, persuading his followers to learn at the mission and helping to break down people's fears of the mission hospital when this was established. Behind him stands Hana Kageye, an aristocratic and influential lady who, together with his wife and mother, was an active Christian. In <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1902 </unitdate>Hana Kageye went to Ankole for a time to help instruct the royal ladies there who lived in seclusion and were virtually inaccesible to the missionaries.

He was paid a tiny salary, and in the case of the C.M.S. this was usually collected from the local church members.</unittitle>

Besides this, conditions were less favourable as Islam was strong among the Swahili peoples, and the Portuguese, like most Christians of their day, treated all Muslims as enemies. The only town with which the Portuguese were on friendly terms was Malindi. The pillar shown here, known as Vasco da Gama's Pillar, was until recently thought to be the original monument set up to mark Portuguese interests, but it is now known to be only a replica of the original.</unittitle>

The only missing ingredients are the palmtree under which he should be sitting, and the rapt attention which should be on the hearers' faces. Until the advantages of the education offered by missions began to be seen, people were often hostile and suspicious of missions, and were only willing to send their children to school if they received financial compensation for the loss of their labour.</unittitle>

              <unittitle>Most of those who came under the care of the missions received Christian instruction and were baptised. This is a page from the Bagamoyo baptism register. When old enough, the boys and girls were married off, and settled in Christian villages situated around Bagamoyo. It was hoped that these would prove attractive to the surrounding Muslim and pagan population, but they were too strictly run, and eventually the missions found a better method of approach was through the establishment of a wide network of bush schools.</unittitle>
