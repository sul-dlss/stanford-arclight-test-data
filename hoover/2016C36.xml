            <p>Časlav M. Nikitović (Chaslav Nikitovich) was born in 1901 in the city of Čačak in central Serbia. His primary and secondary education was local, after which he went on to Paris to study law at the Sorbonne, where he received his doctorate in 1928. After the publication of several books, his experise in law, economics and finance was applied to politics, when he was elected from Macedonia to the Yugoslav parliament in 1935.</p>
            <p>A member of the governing Yugoslav National Party (JNS), Nikitovich served on various financial and legal commissions and as minister of agriculture during 1939−41, in the last government of free Yugoslavia before the German invasion. He survived the German occupation but fled abroad as the country was being taken over by the communist forces of Josip Broz Tito.</p>
            <p>After a short stay in Paris, Nikitovich and his family were able to immigrate to the United States, where they settled in New Jersey. He was active in émigré affairs, writing articles, making speeches, and corresponding with professors, politicians, and old associates.</p>
