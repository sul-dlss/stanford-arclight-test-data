    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>With 1,505 installments over 33 years, <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> is the longest-running public-affairs show with a single host, William F. Buckley Jr., in television history.</p><p>  <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> kept substantially the same basic format throughout its run, but with certain variations.</p><p> (1) It began as an hour-long show for commercial television (i.e., with time subtracted for commercial breaks), syndicated by WOR in New York City.</p><p> In 1971, under the auspices of the Southern Educational Communications Association (SECA), it moved to public television and became a full hour. This move is reflected in a numbering change in the programs: shows numbered 1 through 240 were on commercial television; the SECA series then begins with s0001, taped on May 26, 1971. The WOR shows were numbered according to the order in which they were taped; the SECA shows were numbered according to the order in which they were first broadcast.</p><p> In 1988 the length of the regular shows was changed to a half-hour.</p><p> (2) Starting in 1978, interspersed among the regular shows are occasional specials and two-hour formal debates, with opening statements, cross-examination, and closing statements. The debates were initially numbered as regular shows (the first <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> Debate was s0306, although a debate sponsored by Columbia College's Debate Council was filmed as shows s0296 and s0297 a few weeks earlier). Beginning in 1986, a separate numbering system was instituted for <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> Specials (with the number prefaced by the letters FLS). (Note: Debates listed as "Part I" and "Part II" were shown on consecutive weeks in the regular time slot, rather than being shown all at once in a special two-hour time slot.)</p><p> Starting with S0961 in March of 1993, the formal debate would often be followed by two or more shows in which roughly the same participants were released from the debate format for informal discussion.</p><p> (3) Over the years, Buckley and his producer, Warren Steibel, used various methods of bringing an extra perspective to the discussion. In the early years there would often be a panel of three questioners--sometimes students, sometimes adults.</p><p> Starting in 1977 there would often be a single "examiner," who would play a larger part in the proceedings than the panel of questioners had typically done. The examiners who appeared most frequently were Jeff Greenfield, Michael Kinsley, Harriet Pilpel, and Mark Green.</p><p> In 1988, when the show went to half an hour, the examiner was eliminated, but there was often a "moderator," whose role was similar to that of the moderator in a formal debate. The moderator would introduce both host and guest, and then ask the opening question. The moderator appearing most frequently was Michael Kinsley. Some early programs included a person called a "chairman," who functioned like a moderator.</p><p> (4) Beginning with show 171, in October of 1969, approximately twice a year the tables would be turned, with a panel of questioners putting Buckley "on the firing line."</p><p> Source: Preface to the program catalogue compiled by <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> staff member Linda Bridges, included in box 1.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The collection contains the records of the <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> television series, which was hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. Materials include the original broadcast videotapes from Firing Line, as well as transcripts, photographs, sound recordings, program research materials, and other materials. The types of materials available for each program vary.</p><p> The collection is organized into three series: Episode Guide, Production Materials File, and Audiovisual File.</p><p> The <emph render="bold">Episode Guide</emph> is arranged by show number and includes the title, episode summary, and guest names for each show. Numbers that are followed by an "R" are repeat broadcasts of the same program, while numbers followed by an "E" are edited repeat broadcasts. When applicable, links for purchasing full-length episodes and the availability of special order DVDs are also included. The Episode Guide also lists the supporting documentation for each program: background files, publicity files, and transcripts. Supporting documentation varies by program.</p><p> Background files include program research materials such as clippings, correspondence, transcripts, histories, press summaries, and printed matter, as well as collected materials on speakers and their appearances on <title render="italic">Firing Line</title>.</p><p> Publicity files are available for public television shows produced by SECA and contain materials such as photographs, negatives, slides, transcripts, newsletters, and other materials. The types of materials available for each show vary.</p><p> Transcripts of <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> are both typewritten and printed. Also included among transcripts are two productions hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. that were not <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> programs. The shows have been designated as 000a and 000b. These programs are included in the Episode Guide and the transcripts are located in box 159. Downloadable transcripts for most <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> programs are available on Hoover's digital collections website and can be accessed through the links that accompany each program entry in the Episode Guide.</p><p> The <emph render="bold">Production Materials File</emph> includes administrative files and speaker and research files. Administrative files document the creation of the program. Files contain a catalogue of transcripts; <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> guests' topic lists; programs lists; special debates lists; correspondence with prominent politicians, economists, and scientists; and viewer comments and suggestions. Press releases, newsletters, newspaper clippings, and files on William F. Buckley Jr. and Warren Steibel, <title render="italic">Firing Line's</title> producer-director, are also included. Photographs, negatives, and slides of William F. Buckley Jr. individually and with the guests on his shows complete the records.</p><p> Speaker and research files include clippings, correspondence, transcripts, histories, press summaries, and printed matter, as well as other collected materials on speakers and their appearances on <title render="italic">Firing Line.</title> Not every show or speaker is represented with a file. The original order of the files was retained, and they are arranged alphabetically by the last name of the speaker. Speakers who made multiple appearances may have several files. The William F. Buckley Jr. book <title render="italic">On the Firing Line: The Public Life of Our Public Figures</title> (Random House, New York, 1989) contains an alphabetical list of guests who appeared on <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> (see box 7).</p><p> The <emph render="bold">Audiovisual File</emph> includes videorecordings, sound recordings, and motion picture film.</p><p> Sound recordings contain sound tracks of the early <title render="italic">Firing Line</title> television shows on open reel tapes and compact sound cassettes.</p><p> Videorecordings include the original broadcast videotapes from <title render="italic">Firing Line</title>. Many videotapes have been reformatted to more durable media; additional reformatting depends on funding. Priority for reformatting is assigned to the most endangered videotapes and those programs in highest demand from viewers. Reformatted programs can be viewed on Hoover's digital collections website or on-site in the reading room, or purchased from Amazon. videotapes of programs that have not been reformatted cannot be viewed at this time.

On this show (the first Firing Line taped, though not the first aired), Mr. Harrington begins by describing the despair and consequent lack of initiative engendered by poverty; WFB engages him on the issue of whether we can hope to alleviate either material or emotional poverty through government action. MH: "Being kicked around and being pushed down, living in dense, miserable housing, and dealing with cockroaches and rats are not the kinds of things that make one a balanced, content, normal, and adjusted healthy personality." WFB: "I couldn't agree with you more. But I'm trying to raise the following question: To what extent... can we count on [a poverty program] to alleviate all these concomitant miseries?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

JAP: "I think [the Supreme Court Justices] use the First Amendment in a way it was never intended to be used. [The Founding Fathers] talked about establishment of religion. And they meant, really, establishment like the Church of England is. ... It was forbidding the federal agency, the Congress, from interfering with the existing states' establishment." ... "I personally do not see the value of state-prescribed prayer or of the reading of the Bible, for instance, without study of the background, the context, the thoughtful criticism of the passages, in school. And I think it's a disservice to the Church, too, because it gives parents the illusion that this side of life is being covered by the public agency when, in fact, it's very trivial and perfunctory."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

This often fierce exchange, which places both men on the firing line, begins with WFB's asking why his guest supported the Korean War but opposes the Vietnam War and goes on to explore whether it is realistic even to aspire to contain Communism. NT: "Mr. Buckley, you seem to believe in cruelty as a necessary adjunct to this kind of war. Your main point is that somehow we're going to contain Communism this way, and we aren't. We may delay certain events in Communism. We're not going to contain it. We-" WFB: "Excuse me, was the war in Greece cruel?

Messrs. Buckley and Allen begin by discussing why this should be a touchstone issue, and progress to considerations of whether the death penalty in fact deters, and whether, even if it does, it can be morally defended. SA: I think there are probably various reasons why conservatives generally favor capital punishment. I think one of them maybe so obvious there is the traditional risk of overlooking it, and that is simply that it exists and that it has existed for a long time."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: JF: "President Kennedy, incidentally, adopted the same idea. It's said that he stepped off a plane in Washington. There was an honor guard there to meet him. He saw no Negroes. He called an officer, and said, 'I see no Negroes here.' The officer said, 'Mr. President, no Negroes have applied.' He said, 'Go out and find some.'"

Mr. Faulk had sued Aware and been awarded "the most colossal judgment in libel history"; he was now seeking the abolition of the committee. On this show, Mr. Faulk begins, in his down-home sort of voice, by quoting the then-Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan as having said that "the committee's program so closely parallels the program of the Ku Klux Klan that there is no distinguishable difference between them," and we're off to the races.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

If there were a contest for the title Mr. Eleanor Roosevelt, he would unquestionably win it") by saying: "I must say that I regard that introduction as somewhat rude and insulting, Mr. Buckley. I had hoped, on the occasion of your having your own television program, you would abandon your traditional penchant for personal bitchiness and stick to facts and issues; but evidently your rude behavior is congenital and compulsive. And so I forgive you." But among the billingsgate there is serious discussion of the current offerings on the airwaves, the tendency of the Jewish community to resist the anti-Communist movement, and more.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

RG: "Well, I think the Great Society ...represents a change or a breaking point from the ideas of the New Deal. I think the essential idea behind the New Deal was that rising prosperity, more equitably distributed among the people, would solve most of the problems of the country. . . . Now, having succeeded-not completely, but to quite a degree-in that effort ... we find it doesn't solve the major problems, the kinds of problems you talked about in your campaign [for Mayor of New York] ...and that now we have to turn our attention, not only ... to relief of the poor or dispossessed, but to the quality of life of every American ..."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Still, a fascinating glimpse of the worldview of an inveterate protestor. DG: When these people [the Nuremberg defendants] pleaded that they were only obeying the law ... the world's justices declared that they were guilty and that man has a duty to disobey laws that are contrary to great moral laws. One day we might have another trial, be it in Heaven, be it in Asia--I don't know if we’ll be judged by the Chinese or by the angels--but I want to be able to plead not guilty."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

(Mr. Merrick asks to correct the record: "I can't recall that I've ever had a bad joke in one of my plays, or an untuneful song, or that I've ever produced a bad play.") The conversation, rich with anecdote, winds up being less about the future of the theater than about the relation of the critic, on the one hand, to the theater company and, on the other hand, to the audience--"sort of a necessary evil," says Mr. Merrick.

On the subject of Bobby Kennedy's motivations in attacking Lyndon Johnson, however (Johnson "cannot win with Robert Kennedy because he's William of Orange"), these two old friends and adversaries see pretty much eye to eye. As Mr. Kempton puts it, "[RFK] lacks his brother's real appreciation for people who were a little older than he was and a little more stable and a little more serious.

This rich conversation ranges from the specific and immediate (Medicare, the prospects for the 1968 election) to the general (Has too much power accrued to the Presidency? How can it be curbed?). BG: "I think the country has become pretty much a two-term country. So I think it's pretty much up to the President. If he decides to run again, the chances of the Republicans beating him are not excellent.

Mr. Coffin, however, argues that this is largely because the churches have not taken up the cause of civil rights for black Americans; Mr. Buckley maintains that it has more to do with their ignoring the oppression behind the Iron Curtain. One sample: WSC: "I'll tell you, Bill, why James Baldwin is down on the Church. And Louis Lomax and also many of the rest of [the black leaders]. Because they have told me, 'Every time we see that cross we think, There's a place where they call us niggers.'

This old controversy doesn't wear as well as some, but along the way we get interesting insights into the propriety of Americans representing foreign countries (as WFB points out, John Foster Dulles and Dean Acheson each did at one time or another) and into how a newspaper columnist with an axe to grind and a Senate investigating committee can work hand in hand. TD: "Unfortunately, the terminology 'foreign agent' has an ugly connotation, I think, for most people-the two-peaked-hat character who's spying on Washington. The truth of the matter is that there are many distinguished, celebrated lawyers and citizens who are representatives of foreign governments, and they serve a very useful purpose."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Why, for instance, do Mr. Schary and the ADL regularly attack the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan (and point out that some of their members actively supported Barry Goldwater's campaign) but not attack the equal and opposite extremism of Women's Strike for Peace or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee or the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee?

As WFB puts it, his guest "proceeds on the assumption that there is a nexus between" civil rights and America's foreign policy. Hence, for example, Mr. McKissick had visited Cambodia and had determined that American bombing there was unjustified. This often heated exchange begins with the Henry Wallace movement of 1948 and goes on from there. WFB: "The point is whether you are going to exercise the kind of prudence that will keep CORE from perhaps becoming what the Progressive Party of 1948 became, which is simply a pawn of the Soviet Union."

Probably no one would wish either to claim him altogether, or to disclaim him altogether." And we soon see why, in this exhilarating discussion of education, poverty, and American society. PG: "Now if we mean by literacy, knowing the art of reading and writing, where the objects of the art are imagination and truth, then, of course, to be literate is, you know, importantly to be fulfilling yourself as a human being; but if we mean by literacy, being processed so that you can understand the code in order to buy products, or obey orders, or the rest, then it's a question whether most people wouldn't be freer if they weren't quite so caught in this code."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "I'm not worrying about whether you reject Cotton Mather's accretions on the Mosaic Law, but whether you reject the Mosaic Law. Do you reject, for instance, monogamy? Do you reject the notion of sexual continence before marriage? ..." HH: "Well, I think what it really comes down to is an attempt to establish a ... new morality, and I really think that's what the American ... sexual revolution's really all about. It's an attempt to replace the old legalism. It's certainly not a rejection of monogamy as such, but very much an attempt- In the case of premarital sex, there really hasn't been any moral code in the past except simply that thou shalt not.

An illuminating discussion of the history and present of trade unionism in this country. VR: "Bill, the whole business of using the word 'metaphysical' with George Meany has so discombobulated me, I'm going to have to recollect all my thoughts. But no, seriously, the fact is that when you're talking about new laws, I mean the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act ..., you're going back 85 years to an era when ... the robber baron had the power ...

We do not depend upon the exclusion of Communist China from the UN in order to really show what we stand for and what we're about." To Mr. Buckley, the problem is less the admission than the expulsion: "I'm simply saying that as a pragmatic fact I don't think anybody thinks that we are 'afraid' to bring Red China in except to the extent that we are afraid of doing something wrong....And also that we are afraid of, for instance, the fate of fifteen million overseas Chinese, that we are afraid of the fate of twelve million Chinese in Taiwan, and we're afraid of the collapse of morale in the free sectors of Asia."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "It may sound like rather a personal question, but I think it's objectively interesting. You wrote in your column a few months ago that you had heard Nixon say that the, quotes, Buckleyites were more dangerous to the Republican Party than the Birchites...."

WFB: "Does all that make it anti-Republican? To be intelligent and persuasive?" RN: "...

Mayor Lindsay had made establishing such a board an important part of his mayoral campaign and had instituted it in July; Mr. Kheel ably defends it as affording protection (especially for minorities) against police brutality without hampering their legitimate law-enforcement capability. Mr. Buckley, who had made opposition to the board an important part of his campaign against Mr. Lindsay, quotes J. Edgar Hoover as saying of Rochester, N.Y., a city with a civilian review board, that "the police were so careful to avoid accusations of improper conduct that they were virtually paralyzed."

Or was it properly securing rights frequently trampled on by jaded police, even if this meant that some criminals went free? An illuminating discussion in which useful distinctions are made, e.g., between search-and-seizure cases, where the only people helped by the exclusionary rule are those found with incriminating evidence, and right-to-counsel cases, in some of which--Mr. Neier asserts, referring to recent incidents in New York City--"district attorneys, of all people, had to move for dismissal of indictments ...after murder confessions were secured, after between 10 and 26 hours of police questioning. In none of those cases is it clear that police used actual physical coercion. In each of those cases it is clear that police engaged in standard forms of questioning designed to, on the one hand, terrify the person; on the other hand, to make him think he's confessing to a buddy."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The old classical Olympic Games were restricted, in the words of Herodotus, to those of common temples and sacrifices and like ways of life. The barbarians were excluded. The classical Greeks didn't regard that as a political difference, but the difference between civilized people and barbarians.

WFB: "You, despising racism as much as I do, are prepared to assert that no one who is a racist actually would get into a college of which you were president, but that in fact people can be well-qualified Communists."

And why is it illogical?" FLB: "The most efficient way to try a man is to put him on the stand first and ask him what he knows about the case; then if more evidence is needed, put that on, too. The defendant always knows, except in very rare cases of clear insanity, whether or not he is guilty or at least whether or not he committed the acts charged. His degree of guilt may be fixed with some inference or some judgment by the jury, but he would be the easiest source of information, and in some countries he's called first."

One sample, re states' rights: "Well, I think that's what's been happening in a great respect and I think that too much Federal Government is attuned to your Eastern establishment and the problems of the Southern states and the reluctance of the Southern states so that many times those of us who feel we have earned the right to handle our own problems are simply ignored in an overall position that is designed to fit the desires of the Eastern establishment or the problems of the Southern states."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It's easy for the New York Times to refer to ultra-conservative Republicans, but for some reason you'd have to get a sort of special dispensation, the typewriters would reject it, if you referred to an ultra-liberal Republican."

And why are the New York Times and the New York Post so chary of it? NH: "I suppose they think of the doctrine as a racist doctrine and the corollary concern seems to be that thereby the Negroes will alienate their good white friends and make things much more difficult for the coalition--that luminous coalition of labor, the Church, and civil-rights groups and the like which is apparently about to end the final verse of 'We Shall Overcome'." In fact, suggests Mr. Hentoff, what black power is properly about is the power of blacks to have some say in the running of their own neighborhoods and their own children's schools.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

He demonstrates here that there is nothing reflexive about his dubiety, as the conversation ranges across wars cold and hot. WFB: "For instance, Paul Henri Spaak, who was so much admired by Adlai Stevenson, ... said, 'I think there is a real parallel between the United States policy in 1949 and the situation in Asia now. It seems to me the same policy.' He went on to say that the United States believes that they have to defend people against Communism when they refuse to adopt Communism.... Then he says, 'I see no contradiction between what the United States did in Europe in 1949 and what they did in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.' But you do." CF: "Well, if I could be sure from day to day what the government's principal justification for being in South Vietnam was, I would be in a better position to discuss it.

He argues that WFB is confusing psychedelic drugs, which Dr. Leary says "intensify consciousness," with opiates and alcohol, "something that is an escape, something that takes you away from reality." WFB: "Let's go ahead and agree that LSD seems to be in some particulars different from other opiates or drugs or chemicals, at the same time agreeing that LSD is a departure from the normal world-" TL: "But what do you mean by 'normal world'?

A delicious hour with a guest who comes out swinging and never stops: "As far as the inner life of ADA, it's something which it must be very difficult for someone from a conservative background to understand because they're used to monolithicism and the leader blows the whistle, everybody lines up?

Messrs. Buckley and Scheer wrangle amusingly, though not always productively. WFB: "[Why don't you just say], "Sure, Bertrand Russell's anti-American, but he has a damn good right to be anti-American because during the 1960s we became a highly unlovely country and anybody who was pro-American at that point has an addled wit, to say nothing of an unserviceable moral sense?" Now why don't you say, "Yes, I too am anti-American?" RS: "Because you still haven't defined the term. And the reason I used the term is not because it is a term of my choosing but rather because Russell's critics accused him of being systematically anti-American."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

So, "I'd like to begin by asking Dr. Spock whether he carries in his head a comparison of the number of people who have died during this century from disease in contrast to those who have died, not from war, but from persecution, for instance the 6 million Jewish dead in Nazi Germany." (The answer is, No, he doesn't.) There is sometimes more heat than light generated here, but whether one views Dr. Spock as specimen or hero, the exchanges are fascinating. BS: "I don't know Bettina Aptheker but I have met Stokely Carmichael on a number of occasions, and I got the feeling he is a very sincere and America-loving person, even though he says things that distress some people from time to time." WFB: "He'd be incensed if you called him an America-lover. I mean that quite seriously.

He is infuriatingly sober and ... he has shown an understanding of the humorous dimension of it all." This show offers a rich discussion between two deep students of the subject, starting with Dr. Schwarz's brilliant account of Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956. FS: "What it revealed about Khrushchev and his allegiance to Communist doctrine is possibly more significant than what it revealed about Stalin.... Now, how did [Khrushchev] discuss their [Stalin's victims'] guilt or innocence? He didn't mention one of them by name ... He got right to basic Communist fundamentals: he said, I investigated their class of social origin, and 60 per cent were working class ... therefore it is inconceivable that there could have been 70 per cent treasonable....

"There is much speculation," WFB begins, "on the subject of his future, speculation which I intend to avoid, because the purpose of this program is to ask whether it is possible to be a good governor. By that I mean this: Are we now so dependent on the Federal Government that the individual state is left without the scope to make its own crucial decisions?" A meaty discussion ranging from the way the states in turn squeeze the local communities, to comparative welfare payments in different states, to a favorite subject of WFB's: as Mr. Reagan puts it, "I know I'm accused of oversimplifying, but it doesn't make sense to me for the Federal Government to ... insist that the only solution to our local problems is for them to take the money and then dispense it back to you in grants in which they tell you how to spend it from Washington, D.C.

KC: "I think that what has become increasingly clear to me is the limitation of the American people in terms of concern for human beings. I think there is now clear evidence that the vast majority of Americans are perfectly willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of children who are brown on the altar of race. I think that it is clear that de facto segregated schools in the North are as damaging and detrimental to the human spirit and human potential as the segregated schools which we fought so valiantly against in the South."

The result is mostly bland, but there is considerable historical interest in encountering the pre-presidential Nixon: "Naturally I'm a prejudiced witness... But I believe that as this campaign in 1968 unfolds, that the nation will see that the new Republican Party is one which advocates change, but advocates change in a different way from the irresponsibles. And I mean by that, that in changing those things that are wrong in America, we must not destroy the things that are right.

Then suddenly he had come out for various measures, including increasing trade with the Soviet Union and disengaging from Vietnam, that had dismayed many Republicans, not least because they wondered if this was a harbinger of the 1968 Republican platform. One may sometimes feel during this hour that Senator Morton is hedging his bets, but the conversation does bring out some of the ways in which the scene changed during the mid Sixties. TM: "When Mr. Eisenhower left office there were six hundred men in uniform. He thought, as I thought then, that if we helped these people to offset aggression--if we helped them to resist--they would do the job themselves. Now we've Americanized the war, and in my book it's an entirely different premise. They're not fighting for themselves."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This is one of the favorite tricks of the anti-working-class publicists. After all, the true monopolies are those who manufacture exclusively or market exclusively.

WFB asks: "When last did you notice a war crime committed by a Communist nation?" RS replies: "Now, the reasons for the tribunal and the reason for the bringing together of the members of the tribunal were the enormous, overwhelming prima-facie case documented largely in the Western media concerning the crimes of the United States in Vietnam. I don't think that it is sufficiently understood that the sole object of this war is that of devastation of a small people, occupation of their land, and the rape of their resources."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Freedom is connected with lots of things such as food, such as education. And such as real freedom for all-not only for those who are in power. In other words, we are a little tired of just the juridical aspects of democracy."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The latter, replies Professor van den Haag; "However, Bill, I wouldn't call it abolition." Instead, what he is advocating--and he was one of the first to do so--is vouchers, permitting parents to exercise a choice of schools. This would eventually become a staple of national discussion, but Professor van den Haag was admirably prescient, as well as informative on the question of what was wrong with the public schools."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Is it merely an expression of Vietnam-era anti-Americanism, or does it have to do with a (possibly naive) perception of dishonesty? Mr. Dulles was a legendary figure: his activity on the world stage had begun when, as a very young man, he attended the Versailles Conference; he had organized the CIA, on the foundation of the wartime OSS, and had given it its shape as its first director. However, this show suffers from the degree to which, although four years retired from active duty, Mr. Dulles was imbued with the ethos of secrecy. WFB: "What is it that gave the CIA its bad name? Is it the fact that you have to lie?" AD: "No, I don't think- Let me say as to that, how do you mean 'lie'? ..." WFB: "Well, for instance, the President of the United States lied about the U-2 plane, and he was thought to have done so at the suggestion of the CIA ..." AD: "Well, that was a decision made at a very high level, by the President himself. And I don't think the mere fact you don't admit everything, that doesn't mean you're lying all the time."

However, "I don't think Senator Goldwater as a person was rejected so much as was Senator Goldwater's basic approach to problems. He tended to evoke fear." Much is discussed--from the leadership qualities a President needs, to the different factions within the Republican Party--but Senator Hatfield, who attributes much of Goldwater's fear-evoking to his "off-the-cuff types of responses," never says anything that could disqualify him as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1968.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Then in 1966 he publicly resigned from the Society, on the grounds of dissatisfaction with Robert Welch's leadership. This proves to be (as one might expect from Mr. Draskovich's background) a rich discussion of how a person judges whether a flawed organization is still doing more good than harm. SD: "I thought, and I was free to take that view, that beyond the National Review there was need for an organization which would reach not only the intellectuals [and] fight the Communists -- on a philosophical level and a literary level -- but would reach many more people."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This splendid economics lesson from one of the country's leading teachers begins with a little historical biography (MF: "Keynes, himself, was very much of a scientist. I think he was wrong on various things, but he certainly had a scientific approach. And indeed, I've always regarded it as a great tragedy that Keynes died when he did. Because one of his great capacities was flexibility"), and then goes onto the importance of monetary policy, how we might better handle taxation and welfare, and much else.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Host and guest sometimes talk at cross-purposes, but mostly this is a productive exploration of what might usefully be changed and what are the limits of change. RT: "I approve of student power in certain definitions. I very deeply disapprove of some of the definitions of student power ... I think that some of the statements of student power have essentially said, 'We have the right not only to live our own lives, but to take over everybody else's life as well.'

He was of a very charming family. But he wasn't of a very important family." WFB: "If he had been important, he wouldn't have been discovered yet, do you mean?" RW: "No. What I mean is that Philby had all the slight thrill that his father gave people. You see, his father was pro-Arab. And the British Establishment, the British upper class, has always been pro-Arab-I think because the British upper class has always been very fond of horses-" WFB: "No, come on."

His apostasies from the Left are, however, so numerous as to leave him a member of the Left in the same sense that, say, Bishop Pike is a member of the Episcopal Church." But let Mr. Muggeridge speak for himself: "Well, Bill, I think you must distinguish between being a member of the Left and being a liberal. I regard liberalism as the great disease of our society, and when I said that people like Mrs. Roosevelt, admirable though they were in intentions, would be seen to have done more damage than people like Hitler and Stalin, I meant precisely that. Hitler and Stalin got a lot of people killed and precipitated the great war, but they are now discredited. But liberalism, which has been the dominant philosophy in the most influential and powerful nations of the West, continues to thrive despite the fact that every time it's been applied, the consequences have been disastrous."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

In this illuminating discussion, Mr. Lasky defends his journal ("anybody who has looked through any one single issue and thinks that anybody pulled any strings ... has three more guesses coming") and argues that "what was terribly important," in the ashes of World War II, and with the Soviet Union just over there on the other side of that Iron Curtain, "was that liberals, democrats, and socialists ... were to come to grips with the experience of what had happened to socialism in their time."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

They tend to think of it very much in moral terms, I think, and if I had moral judgments I would make them. But the decisions I would come to on the Vietnam War would be far more objective, I think, than an American would make.

Mr. Buckley reminds us of how Bobby was viewed in those days, even by many liberals: a ruthless tactician, a cynical exploiter of his dead brother, a master of political expediency. Mr. Carter (who had come to prominence in the Thirties and Forties attacking the likes of Governor Huey Long and Senator Theodore Bilbo) defends Senator Kennedy ably-but without softening the edges of this picture. One sample: WFB: "Under the circumstances, the burden is on you to find some cosmic consistency in [someone who] has taken every position there is to take on Vietnam, on Lyndon Johnson, on Joe McCarthy, on liberalism, on Chiang Kai-shek. For all I know, on you." HC: "I'm afraid to get cosmic, but I think he has been consistent in his reaction against labor racketeering, his reaction against the Mafia. They've gone underground, Hoffa went to jail, and Ross Barnett went back to private life. And I think in every case it has been in great part because of his unswerving determination to-uh-to do these people in."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

LP: "First I would like to make a comment on Mr. Buckley's introduction, because there are a couple of notable errors. In the first place, I am not a racist. I might mention I am against the Federal Government using its coercive power to force racial integration upon an unwilling free people... " WFB: "Well, ... have you been widely misquoted? For instance, you're quoted as having said, 'Yes, the Negro is inherently immoral-yes, I think it's the brain capacity.' Is that a misquotation?" LP: "It's not a misquotation. It's the truth."

At the time of this show he was best known as the organizer of the big march on the Pentagon; in a few months' time he would become one of the Chicago 8 (later known as the Chicago 7, after Bobby Seale was separated from the other defendants), prosecuted for their disruption of the Democratic National Convention. Today, guest and host come out swinging and stop only at the final bell: DD: "But anyway, I think it's very important in terms of the New Left to realize that there are no 'foremost peaceniks.' Now, ... for one reason or another, the press focuses more on me than on some other people. But the strength, the heart, the guts of the movement comes not from leaders but from people who are fed up with ... American society in many of its manifestations ..." WFB: "Well, doesn't everybody say that? You know: It wasn't really I-it was all the people who provided all the work and inspiration. That's sort of an after-dinner affectation, isn't it?"

WFB: "She feels the United States is committing a great error by its apparent hostility to the Arab world. I should like to begin by asking Miss Utley whether she believes that that hostility, if that is the word for it, is primarily a reaction to the Communist support of the Arabs." FU: "No, I put it the other way around. The Arabs only turned to Moscow when they could not get any help or any fulfillment of their national aspirations from the West. The analogy I'm always making [is to] ... the Far East.... In 1923, after the First World War, when the West would not give up its imperialist privileges in China, Sun Yat-sen turned to Moscow for aid. This collaboration between the Nationalists in China and Moscow didn't last long ... but this was the beginning of the roots of Communism in China."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

But, agree with him or not, the words are worth hearing too, as an encapsulation of this time: "One of the problems is, critically speaking, no one can understand the problem of police brutality in America, or the police-state we are going through as I see it, without understanding the language of the police. The language that the police use on hippies or Negroes is such that I can't pronounce it to the middle-class audience.

CS: "So much of the reason I got the kind of vote I got from the Negro community-close to 96 per cent-... was because of a great investment of hope in me ... Now, however, the great burden upon me is to produce ... If I don't produce and start showing where you can touch the foundation of a new house going up or a new business within the black community that's going to produce jobs right there, then the reaction toward me, at the minimum, would be the same as toward anybody else, any other mayor whatever his color, and maybe-" WFB: "Even worse."

Taft starts with the question: "Is there a 'Republican' as distinct from a 'Democratic' approach to the problem of the cities?" Mr. Taft is inclined to think there is, and that it has to do with "the individual doing things for himself: "After you're sure they care, then you can start talking about what help do you have to give them to make it worth while for them to care; what kind of elements of discrimination do you have to get rid of; what kind of historical inadequate education, so that a guy doesn't know how to use a hammer or a paintbrush to fix up his own property ...

Time does not, as we're reminded on this show, maintain the fiction that most of our daily newspapers do-the fiction of reporting the news "straight" and commenting only in editorials or "news analyses." As for National Review, it used to bill itself on every cover as "a journal of fact and opinion." WFB: "At some point, the brass at Time magazine will decide, will it not, whether it desires the election of Nixon or let's say Humphrey ...

FW: "After the killing of Dr. King and after the killing of Robert Kennedy many, many people ... gave their opinions, and I would like to tell you first that everybody seems to know where violence comes from-they know where the riots come from, where the wars come from, where murder comes from. I'm the only one who doesn't know, so I'm considered an expert-at least I know one should find it out.

MD: "Luckily the clerical bag is falling apart. Both forces are working at the same time." WFB: "When you refer to 'the clerical bag' do you mean the series of perquisites that they uniquely enjoy?"

Mr. Kuh, meanwhile, "observed the anti-obscenity laws being shot down one after the other and elaborated a theory on how to write statutes that would control the traffic of smut in such a way as to get them by the Supreme Court." Mr. Rembar proves not to be a First Amendment absolutist (although he maintains that, "so far as books are concerned-the printed word-the government ought to stay out of things"), and he is willing to entertain Mr. Kuh's arguments, e.g., regarding books with highly explicit pictures, and regarding sales to children.

Not much of what he and his guests go on to say is a scoop (reporters tend to be liberal; the press helps bring candidates to prominence), but they say it so well. DB: "The last four years, it seems to me, the Republicans have received more sympathetic treatment in the Washington press than their performance deserves."

MM: "You know, there's been awfully little fun in conservative and Republican politics, terribly little fun." WFB: "You don't think Herbert Hoover was fun, huh?"

"I'd known this boy was a psychopathic murderer, and I had known that if he went back into the prison population that it was inevitable that he would kill somebody again. So, I mean, there he is loose in the prison population still, and, of course, cannot be returned to death row and cannot be executed, having got a commutation. So what is the answer to this problem, where you have compulsive homicidal minds who are incapable of controlling this violence of theirs?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: JB: "You're not going to get me in a partisan whipsaw right at the start. It [the failure to raise taxes] was the fault of the American people.... Every leader in the society-business, finance, academic, you name it-every leader said we were right, but the American people didn't agree with them.

Mr. Lowenstein, a vigorous opponent of our involvement in Vietnam, had spearheaded the anti-LBJ campaign, persuading Senator McCarthy to enter the Democratic primaries (having gone first, as WFB recalls, "to Senator Robert Kennedy, but was turned down, then Senator McGovern, ditto"). This lively duel with a man who would become a favorite Firing Line guest starts with Mr. Lowenstein's reluctance to back the Humphrey-Muskie ticket. WFB: "No, but they won’t withdraw your nomination from the Democratic Party, surely. That's yours, correct?" AL: "Well ... The problem is that the possibility of running an alternative Democrat to split the vote among Democrats exists and [may not be] accompanied by massive defections from the Republicans who appreciate my public-spiritedness ..."WFB: "You mean, do I understand you?, that there would still be time for somebody to run on a pro-Humphrey ticket?"

One sample: WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Mr. Brzezinski whether he anticipated the Soviet Union's crushing of Czechoslovakia." ZB: "... Back in June, I thought they would invade ... I thought at that time that the Soviet Union could not afford to let Czechoslovakia go the way it was going. By August I was inclined to feel that ... the Soviet Union had developed certain internal incapacities for deliberate brutal action.... On the eve of the actual invasion ... I thought that rather there would be a change of leadership, rather than an invasion...." WFB: "Now, might a careful student of your writings infer that [the invasion] took you by surprise as a result of your own apparent recent addiction to a thesis of deideologization which in fact history isn't validating?"

On the one hand his [American Conservative Union] rating was very high; on the other hand, his biography handout appears to qualify him for the presidency of the ADA." On this show, Senator Goodell adroitly sidesteps any attempt so to situate him. (Two years later, Mr. Buckley's brother James, running on the Conservative line, unseated Mr. Goodell.) WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Senator Goodell whether he feels any sense of ideological obligation either to his predecessor, Senator Kennedy, or to his benefactor, Governor Rockefeller." CG: "I think my sense of ideological identification is with the things I believe in very deeply....They call me Mr. Constructive Alternative in the Republican Party, because I did feel that it was not enough to say 'No' to programs that were offered that were deficient; that we should offer a better answer."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Tenneson stayed for only a few years, Mr. Wills for a much longer time, returning only in 1965." Neither Mr. Tenneson nor Mr. Wills proves to be madly articulate, but perhaps for that very reason we get something of a sense of how the ordinary GI was likely to react. One factor in Mr. Tenneson's defection was Joe McCarthy ("That doesn't make [America] that much better a place to come back to than where you're at"); in Mr. Wills's case, it was "complete, total dissatisfaction with our own side, with the way they were running things ...

As they proceed to do on this show, starting, of course, with Vietnam (one of Mr. Lee's poems goes: "For a man who fries the skin of kids with burning jelly is a criminal, even though he loves children, he is a criminal, even though his money pumps your oil, he is a criminal"), going on to Americans owning industrial plants in Canada, but also to something more fundamental. LZ: "I'm going to say something that perhaps might shock you, that if you take Mr. William Buckley with his conservative views and make him live in Canada, he would be an anti-American."

A highlight, especially in retrospect, is the discussion of Ronald Reagan. Mr. White had spearheaded the effort to get Governor Reagan the 1968 Republican nomination. Although it failed, it helped make Mr. Reagan a national figure. AC: "I saw that Reagan-Kennedy debate [on the Vietnam War] and changed dramatically my feelings about Mr. Reagan ... First, I think Bobby Kennedy was unprepared, unbriefed, but that's a sort of inside view. I think the average viewer looks at it and says, He's just all over the place, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Reagan is in complete command, and he's a natural man.

On the show itself, Mr. Cleaver is surprisingly low-key in manner, though relentless in his rhetorical style--e.g., about whether encouraging the assassination of Richard Nixon would be consistent with the Panther ideology: "Mr. Nixon is at this moment the pig waiting in the wings to take the place of the other pig that is on his way out.

This serious conversation begins with the United Nations proposal that Jerusalem be made an international city. TK: "Well, I don't think there is a country or a city in the world who would rely on the defense of the United Nations against aggressive power from the outside, nor shall we." WFB: "Well, now, suppose that you made the government of Jerusalem conditional on great-power guarantees of defense. Would that be sufficient?"

Agree with him or not, Mr. Henry is well spoken and well traveled (he draws illustrations from, e.g., Kenya, Tanzania, and Cuba, all of which he has visited): "We are a nation, a distinctly separate nation with a different set of humor, myths, way of looking at history, a totally different view of ourselves in this country from I would imagine a view which most white people have, and we are separated ... from most of the good things of American life."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Not so the second transplant, who is alive today, drinking beer, writing his autobiography, and thinking kind thoughts about the venturesome Dr. Barnard." The conversation is a bit slow getting started, but host and guest eventually engage in a rich discussion touching on what fields of knowledge should inform life-or-death decisions, and what is the scientist's responsibility qua scientist and qua human being. CB: "I'll put it to you this way. Say, for example, that we from the time that we were born, we were used to the idea that when somebody dies, his organs are removed for transplantation. And at this stage, 1968, we've changed this idea now to the idea that when a patient is dead he's buried and his organs will be eaten up by the worms. We would revolt to that new idea, wouldn't we?"</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Despite occasional impasses (like one at the beginning over whether the differences among various countries are "racial" or "cultural"), this proves to be a fascinating three-way discussion of economic competition, how having a Protestant versus a Catholic culture affects a country's economic development, how companies in different countries in Europe might learn to cooperate. JJSS: "You see, for instance, a very Catholic country, the most Catholic country in the Common Market, is Italy. And Italy was lagging industrially, even under Mussolini--when all Italy geared up for a war effort, he could not bring any industrial results in his country. But now this very Catholic country is the fastest driving country in the Common Market."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Conrad is a bull fighting enthusiast, the author of several books on the subject, of which Matador is the latest; Mr. Amory's club advises its members, WFB tells us, "After you have bagged your hunter do not drape him on the automobile or mount him when you get home. Merely the cap or the jacket will suffice." A brilliant three-way duel on a subject where Mr. Amory would challenge many Western traditions, as in this comment after quoting James Michener's account of a bull killed in the ring: "Well, I'm just surprised that Michener could write so feelingly of that animal in its last throes, and yet not feel the way I feel about the animal, which is, Why do it to him?

The dispute had begun with, as WFB puts it, "an explosive disagreement between [Mr. Shanker] and the superintendent of a school complex in an area predominantly Negro and Puerto Rican," the main issue being "community control," which various minority groups saw as necessary for their own "empowerment" and which Mr. Shanker saw as directed against his teachers. AS: "Well, I think that a decision has been made, and I think it's been made by the Mayor, I think it's been made by the Ford Foundation, I think it's been made by high executives in businesses, I think it's been made by some liberal reformers, a decision [in favor of] ... community control.

LA: "There's a constant demand for forms that are relevant to our age. The screen, painting, and sculpture can change their form. The novel tried to change its form. The French novel carried it to the point where Nathalie Sarraute has eliminated characters.... But it seems to me that the novel is not capable of this adjustment to new forms.... I really don't think Nathalie Sarraute is successful in eliminating characters." HM: "But she isn't writing a novel. Why doesn't she call it something else?

The dispute on this show is at times nearly as heated as the one in the Chicago streets five months before, the starting point being the Walker Report's comparative figures for hospitalizations of rioters and policemen. WFB: "It occurs to me that this surely would be the first time in history that one talks about excessive police brutality when the figures seem to suggest the reverse [192 policemen reporting to emergency rooms, as opposed to 101 demonstrators]." SZ: "... Except that I think in that situation, most of the demonstrators were being treated by their own little Red Crosses, and probably didn't feel that they should go to the Chicago hospitals...." WFB: "Oh, come on, Mr. Zion, are you saying-" SZ: "Oh no, quite. You know, people were hysterical-" WFB: "-that hospitals were under orders to what?" SZ: "I'm not saying that at all."

Mitchell Ginsberg had accepted an invitation to appear on Firing Line but had been kept away by an emergency, his place being taken by two of his deputies. Mr. Shiffman begins by asking leave "to correct the record: to date ... to the best of our knowledge, there's been the taking of one-half of one per cent through what is believed to be conspiracy and fraud ... [by] a number of people who have conspired to beat a bookkeeping system, and we are hoping ... that there will be maximum recovery."

A lively conversation at a time, six months before Chappaquiddick, when Teddy Kennedy was seen as his brothers' successor in presidential politics. DH: "Well, I think the Kennedys have been sort of particularly attractive, and romantic--you used the word romantic ...and somehow, there might be a new kind of idealism and a new sort of fresh spirit in America. This sort of myth, I think, began to build, and it has continued. I don’t think there's any doubt that there's a fascination about the Kennedys, that they are somehow bigger than life. They are handsome, they are star-crossed, they achieve all and yet can be struck down...." WFB: "And this is something to which, in your judgment,they primarily contribute, or do you find it an expression of the public's hunger for these attributes which they instantly see realized in the Kennedys?" DH: "Well, I think it's probably a combination of both. I think, you know, the Kennedys are very smart politicians, and I think that they, if they see that they have a mystique working for them, that they would probably work on it rather skillfully."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Today's conversation changes none of the participants' minds, but it clearly lays out the two wings' current positions. WFB: "The Ripon Society certainly seems to me to have affected most people as an organization that is industriously engaged in trying to persuade the Republican Party to be like the Democratic Party." TEP: "No, it's engaged in persuading the Republican Party to do those things that will enable it to compete with the Democratic Party in states where the Democratic Party is strong. That's a bit different. We try to take Republican ideas and formulate them so that they can embrace the necessary role of government in the last few decades of this century."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Perlmutter strongly disagrees, in a frequently heated but informative exchange: "This question of the timing.

The chaos is widespread, and although all of us write and write and write about it, we are as yet without a crystallized understanding of what is behind it all." Professor Grossman proceeds to offer "the cause of violence at universities." It is this: there have been times in the world's history when social organization, when the business of civilization, promoted the well-being of men as individuals. We live now in a time when social organization, and the business of civilization, is hostile to the well-being of men as individuals. The university, and I include my own, and my own classroom, has ceased to be able to instruct in a credible way, and this has led to a response which is as vivid and as meaningful as every man's ability to care about themselves."

RI: "My style is, and that of my organization is, that, we feel that our ideology is so sound that we can persuade any brother that it is in his best interest." WFB: "And if you fail to?"

I think nothing could be worse than the religious teaching in most Catholic schools, and when they suddenly find everything thrown open as it is today, they are unduly disturbed. But I have a kind of hope that great good will come of it in the long run."

And I say, 'For three thousand bucks, and I wouldn't spend an hour with a bunch like you for a nickel less.' And you know, they're so relieved." But he is also thoughtful on the question, How is it that a small group can get away with making life miserable for the majority on campus? "This is a very, very sad state of affairs. One could ask the same question of the city of Chicago, a city of millions which permitted Capone and his gang to terrorize that city.

Along the way, we get a fascinating look at the nuts and bolts of organizing a new Administration-with glances backwards at Mr. Nixon's two predecessors-from the men commonly identified as the liberal and the conservative, respectively, on the President's speech writing team. Especially interesting, in the light of developments in later Administrations, is the discussion of speech writing protocols. WFB: "I notice that there is much less diffidence about acknowledging the fact of it now than there was a few years ago, so that people point to John Jones as the author of that particular speech by the President, whereas these used to be, as you know, highly regarded secrets ... Would you feel free if somebody from the New York Times, say, asked who wrote the speech, or who drafted it, would somebody around say, Oh, Buchanan did?" PJB: "Well, what you would say, candidly, is that Buchanan worked with the President on that issue.... But you take a speech where the President is deeply concerned about it, and where he feels a great deal depends upon it, like the acceptance speech, and the more important he feels it is, the more involved he becomes."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This passionate exchange begins with the details of current events, but it goes much deeper, to the nature of the university itself. WB: "Various visitors to the Cornell campus ... remarked what was certainly true, that is to say, there was something unique at Cornell, and what that thing was, was the extent to which the administration was actually on the side of the militant students. That is unique.... Mr. van den Haag is right, that the President did manipulate the faculty, he failed to assert any authority ..." WFB: "Why?" WB: "That's an interesting question. Why would a man stand by and see his university destroyed? Of course, he will deny that it's being destroyed. He referred to this fascist-like scene that took place ... as the most constructive event in the history of Cornell.... Academic freedom doesn't mean a doggone thing to him.

It was generally assumed that now, finally, Mr. Powell had gone too far, but on the way to political extinction a funny thing happened, namely, the overwhelming support of the British people and surprising support from the colored minority." In his first of several Firing Line appearances, Mr. Powell takes us across centuries and continents and knocks any facile egalitarianism sharply on the head: "Alone of all countries in the world, until 1962 we had no definition of ourselves ... no definition of a person belonging to the United Kingdom.... There was a definition of a British subject, but that was a person who was a subject of the King or Queen. And so as the British Empire extended, that definition included hundreds of millions of people, wherever the sun had not set on the British Empire. So there literally was no difference in the law of Britain between myself coming back from a day's trip to France, and an Indian from the Northwest Frontier entering Britain by air for the first time."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

DB: "I think I'd like to answer that with a parallel. I think it would be perhaps as difficult as it was for the Japanese to execute a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and catch the battleship fleet at Pearl Harbor. It was very hard for the Japanese to do that, and it would be very hard for the Soviets to execute a nearly completely successful attack on the strategic defensive forces." HB: "I would remind my friend Don Brennan that the Japanese lost the war." ... HB: "I am sure if we sat by our advanced radars, if we saw that a thousand missiles were coming at us, and were coming into the areas of the Minuteman in particular ... we would not wait."

WFB: "Is it historically nonsensical to say, as for instance Arthur Schlesinger said after the assassination of Mr. Kennedy, that 'We killed Mr. Kennedy, we killed the three most idealistic people in public life during a period of three years, and we have therefore justified the odium of the world'? Or would you simply dismiss that as emotional reaction?" TRG: "I would not be prepared to share Mr. Schlesinger's collective guilt." WFB: "Would you be prepared to disavow it?"

Dr. Clark is terribly unorthodox. If anything he seems to be saying we need more people." What follows is a serious, though often heated, discussion of technical and moral questions, ranging from whether we ought to spread industry more evenly around the country to whether it would be permissible to put a sterilizing agent in a city's water supply. WFB: "Let me give you a reductio ad absurdum. One way to affect the population is simply infanticide. Kill the third child or the fourth child, depending on what you economists advise us at any given moment. But we do reject this for moral reasons, do we not?" AS: "Yes."

The fact that Dr. Smith's practice is among the dropped-out children of the well to do in Haight-Ashbury, whereas Dr. Baird's is among the poor in Harlem, may have something to do with their diametrically opposed viewpoints.

The Liberal Party is an old-timer; the Conservative Party had been founded less than a decade earlier, by, for the most part, Republicans concerned about that party's drift to the left. It was on the Conservative Party ticket that Mr. Buckley had run, four years earlier, for Mayor of New York. For this show, Firing Line's Producer, Warren Steibel, had invited representatives of the Liberal Party to appear on this show, but they had declined. In their absence, this is a genial discussion between two old comrades in arms, five years after the defeat of Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican presidential nomination, and of Barry Goldwater for the Presidency itself.

WFB begins by saying that Captain O'Neill had resigned "in protest against his own party's failure to back him up with sufficient conviction ... in his determination more or less moderately to provide for the rights of Catholics." Captain O'Neill begins with a partial correction: "I felt that if I were to resign at the time I did that my policies might continue under somebody else, and ... in fact the reform has indeed, though I say it myself, gathered pace since I resigned." A genuine conversation, rich in anecdote, in which our guests-both born and raised in Northern Ireland, the one Protestant, the other Catholic-work to help an American audience understand this tangled situation. DD: "Growing up in Northern Ireland, which I did, the terminology which surrounded me ... in fact was a sectarian and religious terminology. You know, in the sense that I could spot a Protestant at a hundred yards, and, even more radically, he could spot me." WFB: "You being a Catholic?" DD: "I was a Catholic and am ... It was a sectarian division, it was really not a political division. Certainly, it's true I believe even yet in Northern Ireland, that one is not primarily aware of people as being Nationalists and Unionists, in a political context, but rather of their being Catholics or Protestants, in a sectarian context."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

A few years ago, tired of defending himself against the derogations of the Communist press, he collected his essays and published them under the title, Random Thoughts of a Fascist Hyena." A conversation full of anecdote, starting with a comparison of the protestors of the Sixties with the men of the Thirties (of whom Mr. FitzGibbon was one) who pledged not to fight for King and country; and going on to the West's "difficulty in thinking in triangulating terms, if I may so put it. The Russians never doubted for a moment that they were against both us and the Fascists. We tend to think that our enemy's enemy must be our friend"; with a delicious digression describing a luncheon at which Winston Churchill was given a medal bearing the image of Napoleon: "I couldn't help thinking at that time that if Churchill lived long enough, somebody would give him a large, gold German medal bearing the head of you-know-who on it. Because there wasn't anybody more anathema to Churchill, apart from Hitler, than Napoleon Bonaparte."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

A profound discussion, rich in historical detail, of the survival of monarchy in the modern world, the future of Europe, and what happens to regimes following a national debacle. OvH: "You see, the Weimar Republic died not because it was bad-it had its faults, indisputably-but especially because it was an expression of Germany's defeat in the First World War. Hitler and his people were able to hang onto the Weimar Republic the symbol and the stigma of defeat. It's exactly the same thing we had with the First Republic in Austria.... [It] began in disaster, that is to say, the dissolution of the old Empire.

A perhaps surprisingly interesting discussion of this problem, which, as we know now, Mr. Blount's efforts were not sufficient to solve. Although some of the specifics he tells us about have been remedied-the Post Office no longer sorts mail with the technology Benjamin Franklin put in place when he was the fourth Postmaster General-Congress still sets the prices and makes the rules. "I note here that in 1789, which was the first year of the operation of the Post Office under the more or less present system, you ran a deficit of $40, thereby, somebody put it, establishing a venerable American tradition."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

In 1969 he had "triumphantly returned to Washington, escorted," as WFB puts it, "by a Republican President whose election in turn it is quite widely conceded would have been unlikely but for the race of 1964." WFB begins by asking his guest "what did he have in mind when, last spring, he chided dissatisfied American conservatives who were critical of Mr. Nixon." The Senator replies in pure Goldwater mode: "Well, nothing but the same thought that I've always had when I've chided fellow conservatives who are acting as conservatives should. To put it another way, they're speaking their own minds." And we're off on an examination of the Nixon Administration, the Vietnam War, and how one might begin rolling back "35 years of statism."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Waugh had visited the region as a journalist and come back to write Biafra: Britain's Shame. A rich discussion of the state of Africa, how a country decides when to intervene in others' disputes, and much else. WFB: "Well, is it then your assumption that if the consequences of backing the Nigerian government had been known, neither the Labour government nor a Conservative government would have proceeded to do so?" AW: "Well, I can't honestly believe that they're either so wicked or so stupid as to dissent from that. On the other hand, when was it? About nine months ago, I was going around, because my job takes me among all the politicians in England, and telling them, 'If you go on with this policy, [Colonel] Gowon [Nigeria's dictator] is going to kill half a million people.' And they laughed at me and said, 'Where do you get that figure from?' And of course I had invented it, but it was my assessment of what it would cost. Well, now they know it's cost a million and a half. You know, one does wonder whether in point of fact they care, because politically they've got away with it.

Soustelle headed the actual Resistance at home. The two men had broken in 1960 over Algeria: "Should it be a part of France, as President de Gaulle had once believed, or not? When de Gaulle changed his mind and Soustelle didn't, de Gaulle literally sent his former friend into exile. A superb hour with a man who is a genuine scholar as well as a man of action. Whether he is discussing the Constitution of the Fifth Republic or the economy of Algeria, he speaks with the voice of authority. I was one of the few people who met [de Gaulle] during those last few years before 1958, and I saw him more and more bitter, more and more let's say desperate, because he thought that he would never come back. And probably during those years a kind of alchemy took place ... so that he became more self-centered, more egotistical, more authoritarian.... And on certain points, not only did he change his mind or his behavior, but he definitely changed his doctrinal position, his philosophy of power and of politics."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Accordingly, we have invited three distinguished gentlemen, of indistinguishable liberal reputation, to take the offensive and put their questions on the general theme of race and conservatism." In this first of what would become a more or less semi-annual feature of Firing Line, Rep. Moss starts things off by saying that, "having just been characterized as one having impeccable qualifications for that label, I would like to have a brief definition from you as to what I am, as a liberal."

JJ: "[The Democratic Party] seeks immediately to find a choice in government for any public ill; any, that runs the wide gamut from poverty to the necessity to encourage small business.... I believe that one can be a liberal-and I accept that designation, not because in the Republican Party we use the term particularly; we always use the term progressive,... but I accept it because it defines a way of thinking, an outlook, and I think that outlook, Bill,... is that if the people have to have something done for them, then it's got to be done, and you can't be doctrinaire about the method.

There had been agitation for years-strengthened by the thalidomide disaster-for liberalizing abortion laws, and several states had done so. Our two guests present the heart of the opposing positions as clearly as can be. To Dr. Guttmacher, "My own feeling is that the mother-a living human being, who has interaction with other human beings-her rights are so powerfully more predominant than a mass of protoplasm which she carries within her womb that there's no comparison between the two." To Dr. Ayd, "The fact of the matter is from the very moment of conception, where the sperm of the father contributes half of the chromosomes and the ovum of the mother contributes the other half,... you now have a unique individual who has never existed before and will never exist again. And from that moment on, you have a continuum until death occurs, whenever it may occur."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Myrdal jumps right in: "Well, let me first say after all of this you've heard about me, that's just cheap journalism, you know, which is under my level." In exchanges that frequently draw blood, we get a clear picture of asocialist's--as opposed to a totalitarian's--idea of how central planning should work: "Of course, you know that this country, which is supposed to be a free-enterprise country, you are so full of bureaucratic rules and regulations, it's almost difficult to come and visit you. Of course, we have a much freer life in Sweden.... The main thing about planning is to change the big things.

We begin by listening to a few minutes of their work, "at roughly the sound level," according to WFB, "the audience hears it at" in the theater. Mr. Courtney demurs from that description: "The playing of that music at the level at which you hear it in the theater is impossible. Unfortunately, the people at home are sitting there with three-inch speakers on their television sets, due to the desire of the television manufacturers in this country to save as much money as possible to rob you of your needed sound." And so on, through denunciations of hypocrisy regarding sex, the importance of "vibrations" in rock music, and the rest of the kid scene A.D. 1969. Where this show sometimes misses as conversation, it works as illustration.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

He asked the Humphrey people if he might tag along, but they said, Hell, no, you can't tag along. The Nixon people were less cautious..." The "selling" in the title refers to the PR tricks used on television: "the image-building, image-changing work," as Mr. McGinniss puts it: "They completely eliminated the Tricky Dick, the loser image, all these bad things that had been hangovers of 1962, and by the time Mr. Nixon went to Miami, I think, it was almost to be coronated, not nominated." One might question, as various reviewers had done, whether Mr. McGinniss had played fair with the Nixon people in presenting his project; but today's discussion proves illuminating on the way we choose our candidates.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Rostow is willing and more than able to engage the argument that was put forth by Mr. Cousins and is defended here by his editor, Mr. Moskin. ER: "That affair was one of, I don't know, sixty, perhaps seventy-five rabbits that we pursued down every hole. Now, it's unimaginable, I think,... that any American President would miss a bona fide opportunity for peace,...after the experience that President Truman had with Korea, which destroyed his political career ... The temptation, the risk for the future, would be that the President would be tempted to settle for less than true peace ... Now, the episode that was recently written up by Mr. Cousins was one of a great many similar episodes in which a hint would be made to an American official in some remote corner of the world, and we would send officers ... to meet secretly in hotel rooms, and behind potted plants in bazaars, and try to open up a path to negotiation-a path to negotiation which could lead to a peace that was compatible with our treaty commitments.

We should extricate ourselves, he told his audience, not with deliberate speed but with dedicated dispatch"--which Mr. Cleveland later glosses as "speed that looks as if you mean it." From Mr. Cleveland's point of view, Mr. Nixon's chief problem is "wanting to get as much, squeeze as much out of the negotiation, if there is a negotiation, or out of the mutual de-escalation, if that's the way it works, as he can ... but that's going to be a matter of judgment as you go along, as to how important it is to hang onto that tray in your hand when you're really going to lose the trick anyway." An absorbing discussion, ranging from recent events in Vietnam, back to Korea (WFB: "You don't think we consulted Hammarskjold about it. Can you see MacArthur calling up Hammarskjold and asking for permission for the Inchon landing?"), and forward to the future of Hong Kong.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

An ominous moment, in the light of developments just a few years away, is Mrs. Luce's working out of her theory of what constitutes greatness in Presidents: "I think there's no evidence whatsoever as of now that President Nixon is or will become a great President. But you know I take a rather simplistic view of what a great man is. I think a great man is always the author of a unique and significant action. So far there is no unique action of which Mr. Nixon is the author."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

We begin judiciously enough, with a discussion of the effect the Watts riots and the sit-ins at the University of California had on the 1966 campaign. But then we get to this real eye-opener, on one of Mr. Brown's famous campaign commercials. "I walked in with two little girls and they were obviously six or eight years of age, and I said to them, are you going to vote for me? And they looked at me rather quizzically, and ... as I walked away, I turned around to them and I said, 'Remember, it was an actor that shot Lincoln.' ... Really it was so obviously a facetious remark, and said with a smile, that anyone that had seen the picture would have laughed at it. Before we showed the picture, everybody looked at it, and I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

One of the guest-inquisitors in this case is a libertarian conservative; the other two are double-distilled radicals. In reply to Mr. Hukari's question about "how conservatives can escape the vicious stereotype" of being "the son or daughter of a retired Army colonel, combining the unctuousness of Bert Parks with the intellectual depth of Max Rafferty," WFB suggests that "people who are a minority in the intellectual community have got ... to strive harder to insist on the making of proper distinctions." Messrs. Rapoport and Nisker, as young radicals in San Francisco in 1969, don't need to worry about all that. Mr. Rapoport talks about the effort during the last couple of years "to exterminate the Black Panther Party": "I mean,... all of these incidents have happened the same way. The police have surrounded all the headquarters and charged in the same fashion,... and I mean if this started happening to Republican headquarters or Democratic headquarters? I just think-" WFB: "Well, I think any Republican headquarters that has in it Thompson submachine guns and grenades and high-explosive dynamite ought to be charged into, and if in the course of charging in there is resistance and a Republican gets killed, we'll simply have to accept that as one of the costs of doing social business."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Our guests strongly disagree, but in the courtliest possible way, in an exceedingly informative discussion of the various types of trade barriers (tariffs, import quotas, internal "turnover taxes" or VATs), how they are applied in different countries, and the effect of different levels of productivity. HW: "The point about wages is this: we pay maybe five times as much per man hour as do the Japanese. We pay two or three times as much as do the Germans, French, Italians. Now, does that ruin us competitively? The answer is we use very little labor per unit of input. And if you restate these wage comparisons, instead of wages paid per hour, in terms of wages paid per unit of output, per slab of steel, or per car, or pair of shoes?" WFB: "Then we do a lot better." ORS: "... Now, Mr. Wallich has just said that there are some industries that are capital intensive, so to speak, where the labor cost is not as high.

Buckley and Galbraith had been favorite fencing partners on many platforms, but this was the latter's first appearance on Firing Line, prompted by the publication of Ambassador's Journal: A Personal Account of the Kennedy Years. We get the flavor of their style of thrust and parry right from the start (JKG: "Oh, sure, it was a great piece of nonsense, I should- I was greatly tempted to take it out; but once you start improving your record by hindsight-well, you know yourself where it leads, you've done so much of it..." WFB: "Well, I may be guilty of heresies, but I don't remember deserting any of my heresies." JKG: "Oh, yes, yes, Bill-I remember that very good book of yours on The Unmaking of a Mayor, where you deserted your whole conservative doctrine ..."); but there is also serious discussion of the way the State Department bureaucracy works, how a country decides when to intervene abroad, and Mr. Galbraith's exhilarating account of China's border conflict with India that "coincided with the missile crisis in Cuba, and I had this war all to myself for several weeks ... and the effect on a middle-aged intellectual of being able to run a war..."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It is Mr. Agnew's spectacular charges that Mr. Klein is here to discuss, calmly as ever, because there is nobody in the whole world who is calmer than Mr. Klein." Our guest proceeds to live up to this description, and so there are no fireworks on a topic that had been exploding around the nation. However, he does provide a helpful double perspective, as someone who now represents the Administration but who knows the news media from the inside. HK: "I've heard many of those who reacted hardest say worse things in criticism of the media than Mr. Agnew did. On the other hand, it's like if you go outside of the fraternity and make this type of statement, then it's illegal."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Indeed one might call him the Spiro Agnew of the Highbrows." What follows is a splendid discussion, rich in detail, of how a community coheres, how America had changed in its perceptions of minorities, and how individuals now feel free "to bollix up the works" in pressing their own demands. One sample from Mr. Boorstin: "I think that if we start with the idea of community then we can easily make a distinction between dissent and disagreement. I define disagreement as the exchange of views over how to obtain the common ends of the community. Dissent I identify ..., through its Latin origin, with a feeling of separateness, the emphasis on that which separates rather than that which unites people. And I think that there has been a tendency to create a cliche, a new cliche in America, which is that it's good for people to feel and emphasize their separateness from all other people; and I think that much of what is glorified under the name of dissent is really the exclamatory expression of the self..."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

One sample: WFB: "Well, but is it always commendable to use restraint, or is restraint sometimes an expression of cowardice or lack of conviction?" FJS: "It can be both.... Take, for example, turning the other cheek. If there are ten men in a line and I preach hate to them and say you must destroy your brother, and one man turns and strikes his neighbor, two strikes three, when will it ever stop? It will stop only at a point where one man turns around and absorbs the evil. In that sense, restraint can absorb evil. From another point of view restraint does not absorb evil; it sometimes may increase it. The crimes certainly on our streets, today, the turn of law by which there is compassion shown more for the mugger than for the mugged, more for the one who does the violence than for the victim-this is a kind of restraint which is not commendable, and which I fear will bring some trouble to our nation."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

A rich discussion starting with the security investigations of the early Fifties, but moving back to World War II and the development of the hydrogen bomb, and forward to the "current blacklisting of scientists by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare." Mr. Stern cites the wartime case of Edward Teller, who was almost denied a security clearance because he had relatives in Nazi Germany; Mr. Buckley cites the case of Suez in 1956, where the Soviets found out about the proposed Israeli-French-British invasion through the efforts of one of "these individuals that you simply dismiss as ciphers [but who] are people who change events." PS: "After World War II, when our armies went back in, they tried to find out where the Germans were in their atomic research, and they found that they were two years, at least, behind us, and one scientist tried to find out why. And a cardinal reason was that Germany had done just what we did in the Oppenheimer case ... They had politicalized their science."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

His newest book, Power, was, as WFB puts it, "an attempt to ... decoct from human experience some imperishable laws explaining and indeed governing the uses of power." Serious political theory and lively exchanges-with one of the most telling bits of humor being unintentional, apropos of the Berle Law ("that wherever there is chaos it will always be occupied by power"): WFB: "What about Colombia, for instance?"

He argues stoutly, and with plausible illustrations, that there really isn't much difference between English and American audiences--despite, as Mr. Buckley puts it,"the expectation that, because of the BBC, there would be in England ... a listening audience that is more sophisticated, more inquisitive, more demanding than the American audience." Not at all, says Mr. Frost. In fact, "I think the picture of there being ... in some curious way ... lower taste or less intelligence in the mass audience in America compared with England is either a ludicrous piece of modesty on the part of Americans or a plot by the East Coast and the West Coast to denigrate the people in the middle of the country." Much about styles of public conversation and interviewing, and a fascinating side-glance at Enoch Powell.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The "great ideas" get into the discussion, but not separately from the way people are, or should be, introduced to them. Mr. Adler is scathing on the effect our present graduate schools have on undergraduate learning ("the college, instead of being an institution of liberal learning, concerned only to liberate the mind, to discipline it and liberate it,... becomes nothing but a channel, a conduit, into the specializations of the graduate schools." ... "My definition of a good teacher, which I have a hunch you will share, is a person who is himself dedicated to continued general learning.... I know it's kind of trite to say that Socrates was the greatest teacher, but he was. And he was, simply because his teaching was the conduct of an inquiry, in which the students were engaged in the inquiry with him. Now that, it seems to me, is the kind of teaching that should go on in college.") On to Thomas Aquinas, John Dewey, how to help the least able child, and much more.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

We begin with a clip from each, with its writer/director setting the scene, and then move on to the discussion. Mr. Kramer has a wonderful story about how he had tried to enlist F. R. Leavis's interest in his version of Women in Love and what the great man did to him; Mr. Kastle tells of the different ways a work in progress looks depending on your perspective: "When I wrote the screenplay in this film there were many scenes that I felt were right. And a lot of it involved nudity. And when I became the director of the film, I had a terrible fight with myself. The writer is always supposed to fight with the director, and I was-I had a constant battle ... And I found that what I was doing was I was taking out things that really happened [in the real-life story on which his film was based] in order to make the movie more truthful....It's a very difficult paradox."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Their discovery had nothing whatever to do with the Vietnam War, you understand, merely a coincidence." It turns out that there are non-Vietnam-related reasons to oppose ROTC-reasons that Mr. Germino is on record as having adduced for a different government program long before we were involved in Vietnam, having to do with "extramural control" and the fact that "the courses are designed for recruitment and training for a single employer"-i.e., they are not academic in the strict sense of the word. Mr. Bierman adds that "I personally have, for example, fought not a very successful battle ... trying to remove credit for physical education at my college, precisely for the reason that you mention, in that I don't think it's an academic subject either." But more important to him is the question "whether one believes that the university should be an agent or an arm of whatever institution pays the bill. Or whether you think that it should in fact try to fight for a certain kind of autonomy."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The idea this time is to examine current American conservatism by looking at National Review, of which Mr. Buckley is the founder and Editor. We start with the magazine's position on the Nixon Justice Department and individual liberties, the concerns of the young, the use of obscenity-and then the trill: WFB: "I think a conservative is somebody who has a sense of perspective ... I remember a story about Victor Borge. He was 12 years old, and he was a child prodigy, so the Royal Copenhagen Symphony Orchestra put him on to play a Schumann concerto, and .. .towards the end of the first movement, he was doing a trill, and the entire orchestra of 125 people was completely silent, and 3,000 people were completely silent, and all of a sudden he was just carried away by how ludicrous it was to play a trill while everybody was just sort of sitting, so he just went on and on, and they broke out laughing. Now, occasionally, when one finds oneself being very solemn, I think of Victor Borge, and I think it is a part of the conservative view of things to understand, for instance, that this isn't the terminal experience of any human being, we're here at the pleasure of God, and moving, one hopes, into far greener pastures, and that under the circumstances, one must be careful not to become completely obsessed." LCD: "Trill now and then." WFB: "You've got to trill now and then, yeah, that's right; or recognize the trill."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"I would distinguish myself from liberals and conservatives somewhat in this fashion: the liberal ... will concede the existence of the problem, and his response to it is to go: Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk ... He says yes, the problem is there and it's pretty terrible, and we probably ought to do something about it ... The conservative ...says, 'What problem? What problem? The only thing that's wrong is that there are people who don't understand the true nature of American society and how great it is and how it's moving on an upward trend all the time.' And so what the radical seeks to do, not always successfully, is to search for the roots of the problem ... it's as if you had a sick patient and the doctors were to say to him, 'Yes, you're sick, I think aspirin will take care of you,' when in fact what's needed is open-heart surgery." And on to the history of race relations in America, and why students in Santa Barbara burned down a bank in protest against their university-supplied housing, and why people like Ted Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. aren't as important as conservatives think they are.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Now, in the turmoil of the Vietnam era, host and guest are pretty much on the same side of the barricades. JBC: "You know, I feel, if I may say so, a little bit aggrieved at the way Fate has treated me on this question of education beyond the high school. I'm a little like a cavalry officer who got ready to write his memoirs just about the time they mechanized the cavalry." Some time is devoted to the two men's old bone of contention (whether private, and particularly Church-related, schools have a place in American society), but much more is spent on a wonderfully rich exploration of morality and bravery in warfare. JBC: "I said that I didn't see that there was any difference, really, between attacking a person with poison gas, which would attack his lungs and face, perhaps, and ripping him apart with machine guns or fragments of shell.... Once you were in a war, I don't think that you had more or less moral methods of carrying on a war, and this was very true about all of this terrible bombing ... in World War II."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Governor McKeithen, as WFB puts it, "argues ... not the virtues of compulsory segregation, but the necessity of accepting de facto segregation.... [He] persuaded the legislature to pass a law in every way identical to a law passed in New York State in 1969, even, as Governor McKeithen likes to point out, to the point of duplicating a grammatical mistake in that law, in order to dramatize that he doesn't want anything more than what New Yorkers are treating themselves to." Integrationists had impugned Governor McKeithen's motives; on this show he argues, with much supporting detail, "I think it's going to take time. I think eventually, eventually the predominant Negro school, the predominant white school, I think will come to an end in this country. But I don't think we should force children ... into something that their parents won't do themselves."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This proves to be a fast-moving and informative exchange, beginning with the Soviet Union's routine agricultural disasters and going on to our own "paradox," as Mr. McGovern puts it, which is hunger "at a time when we can produce more than enough to take care of all of our people." Specifics come from both the supply side (as WFB puts it, we "send great gobs of money to rich farmers, like Senator Eastland,... paying them not to grow food") and the demand side (Senator McGovern quotes "studies show[ing] that poor people, dollar for dollar, do a better job of buying what they ought to eat than the rich do").</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

He was still, as WFB puts it, "widely acknowledged as among the two or three principal spokesmen for the South. He is also widely applauded and widely reviled for having been a major factor in the victory of Richard Nixon as President," having helped persuade fellow conservative Southerners to vote for Mr. Nixon rather than George Wallace. There is some talk here about that election, but more of this often pungent discussion focuses on the South itself and the way, according to Senator Thurmond, it is misrepresented in the North, with some reminders of how he earned his standing to speak: "I remember when I was governor [in the late Forties], anybody who wanted to vote regardless of color could vote. And we put on campaigns to provide better educational facilities for the black children. And at one point I had to have some white men arrested for lynching a Negro in South Carolina, brought them to trial. I was told it was the first time in the history of the state that had been done. Well, it probably wasn't a pleasant thing, maybe, where a state is predominated by whites, ruled by whites, to do that, but it's the only right thing to do, is to give equal justice to all people."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Suddenly and secretly, Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess flew to Britain and parachuted down, intending personally to negotiate a peace between England and Germany. For his pains, Hitler sentenced him to death in absentia, Churchill put him in jail, and the Nuremberg court, five years later, sentenced him to life imprisonment." Twenty-four years after that, he remained the only prisoner in Spandau--the next to last having been released in 1966. Today's conversation is halting at times, owing to Wolf Hess's imperfect English, but illuminating on the general question of war crimes, and often moving on the specific case. AM: "I remember your father today as a very straightforward and a very simple man. And I think you'll agree, not a man of tremendous intellect. And I have always believed that it was the planned attack on Russia [by Germany] that completely unbalanced him. And he then searched back in his memory; he quite wrongly thought the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had met skiing ... before the war, was an important figure in England. As you know, dukes aren't, but your father thought he was, and he flew to Scotland in a brave, rash attempt to contact the Duke of Hamilton and negotiate a peace."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

NS: "... this is why it is crucial that you should not segregate children in education at an early age, or indeed at any age, because you are thereby saying,...

The audience may feel a bit left out at the beginning, when Messrs. Stevas and Steel wrangle over who did or didn't draft or redraft the "conscience clause" in that act (which states that doctors and nurses are not obliged to perform abortions), but eventually we get to the point at issue: "The really bad effects of the Abortion Act, you know," says Mr. Stevas, "were that it has made people abortion minded. That's what I object to. I freely can see that there's a case for carrying out an abortion in very difficult circumstances; but now it's the first option that people think of. We have this crazy social policy, in which it's very difficult to get family planning out of the National Health Service, and abortion is made easy.

Both guests had been Angry Young Men. "To be an Angry Young Man," WFB explains, "you had to be young, angry about the insufficiency of Western institutions, implacably anti-American, easy-going on the Soviet Union, and talented." Have Messrs. Braine and Amis benefited materially from their apostasy? JB: "I've never had a thing, not even a free ticket to Lord's." The Left, Mr. Braine continues, "never plays fair, and the trouble with the Right is that it does, because we have an entirely different set of values. That's why we're such fools, and that's why the Left is forging ahead of us." ... KA: "Anybody ... might, for arguable reasons, want the American involvement in Southeast Asia to stop, as quickly as possible. That seems to me tenable. I don't agree with it, but it's arguable. But to support the other side, the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong, to go around crying Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh, seems to me reprehensible on a very broad front, morally and intellectually and politically, in the sense that it makes political nonsense."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

However, they have a solid and productive discussion about how our information agencies operate, how they might be more effective, and--in the light of 250 State Department officials signing a protest to the Secretary of State over the Cambodian incursion--what are the different obligations of the political appointee and the career Foreign Service Officer. FS: "If a decision was undertaken by the President, which I felt very deeply in my heart and in my mind was wrong for the American people and would wreak lasting damage on the country, I think that I really would have no alternative except to resign and then publicly oppose the decision." For the career Foreign Service Officer, on the other hand, "over the next ten or twenty years there are certain to be a number of policies in any Administration that privately as a citizen he would oppose. He must support those, to the best of his ability, with the same degree of effort and professionalism as he would those he happens to support."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The conversation frequently changes direction, since it is Mr. Klein's thesis that "SDS and National Review and the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are all symptoms of a failure to really come to grips with the problems of America," whereas Mr. Kelman concentrates on SDS: "I tried above all to, instead of attributing motives, to analyze why their ideology degenerated in the way it did. Why an organization which started off saying, 'Let the people decide,' and which started off seeking certain things that I would feel are improvements in American society, degenerated into an organization whose model for America would be something like Mao Tse-tung's China."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

GR: "When I say that [the President] loses contact [with the people], I do not mean that he is cut off from information. No.... In fact, he's smothered in information ...

As of July 1970, the stock market, which had been strong in the early 1960s, had been lagging inflation for more than four years; as we know in hindsight, not until 1981 would the Dow-Jones Industrial Average match the high it had reached in 1965. This show offers a good, solid discussion of an elusive topic. AS: "And no matter what the next thing is that happens in the market-and there will be a next thing-it too is born to die.

In Mr. Burns's view, for example, "the decision, made for military reasons, not to open a second front in Europe in 1942 but rather to wait until 1944 wound up virtually guaranteeing Soviet hegemony over Central Europe, because by the time of Yalta we desperately wanted Soviet assistance in tackling Japan.... Russia had us just the other way around in Asia-that is, we wanted them to create the Second Front... on the mainland in Asia, in order to cut down on our casualties. And what Roosevelt did again, in his typically opportunistic, short-run, realistic way, if you will, is to pay the price [at Yalta] to get Soviet assistance against Japan, after we had failed to come to Russia's assistance in Europe."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The discussion becomes quite technical at times--in terms of balance of payments and what happens to a dollar that a foreigner earns by selling goods here--but host and guest never lose us as they explore the question, as Mr. Buckley phrases it, "Why wouldn't a policy of unilateral free trade [i.e., not imposing tariffs even if others do] ultimately work out economically?"</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Buckley starts out by asking whether "... it is possible to discuss marijuana and the law without arriving at any fixed conclusions on how harmful marijuana is." Mr. Kleindienst's first reaction is Yes; but as soon as Mr. Kaplan states that the enormous cost of criminalizing marijuana use could be justified only "if the drug were as bad as some people said it was," it becomes apparent that, in Mr. Kleindienst's words, "You have to talk about the two at the same time,... because if you took my theory that it is dangerous, then it would ... dissipate the validity of his theory."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

(The Nixon Administration did so on August 15, 1971.) Mr. Janeway replies engagingly: "Frankly, I find myself a bit off balance being out flanked on the pessimistic side;... they pun on my name all the time and call me Calamity Janeway, and I really regard myself as the last optimist." And we're off on a high-energy discussion of the differences between domestic and international policies, or, as Mr. Janeway puts it, "the hamburger dollar available to us nationals within the sovereignty here [as against] the international dollar."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The often moving discussion with this man who had narrowly avoided a court martial for surrendering his ship ranges from the details of the Pueblo's, capture to general questions of intelligence collecting, to, as WFB puts it, "the business that you can only give your name, rank, and serial number" and whether that ought to be changed. LB: "I would hesitate at the present time to discuss actual recommendations ..." WFB: "Why would you be hesitant?" LB: "Because there are several hundred POWs over there in North Vietnam right now who are trying to live up to it, and with a statement that might be made by myself or any other military person, it would be used against those kids, and I wouldn't want to contribute to the problems they've already got."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

As Mr. Pritchett explains, "I think the initial concept of a professional association ... was that this was a place where you came to meet your colleagues, talk about ... our professional interests, our teaching problems, our research problems." But now the association, like the campuses where its members teach, has been politicized, and, as Mr. Fellman (whose campus had been the scene of a fatal bombing at a research laboratory) puts it, "we really haven't gotten accustomed to using the skills necessary to deal with the kind of problems the association now has."

The question before the house is whether young rock fans can be shown that Bach is not dry and academic; Miss Tureck illustrates her points superbly at the keyboard, but, as her engagement with the young panelists demonstrates, she is as much at home with words as with her own craft. Miss Tureck, to panelist Phil Ardery: "I would like to ask you a question, and that is, do you feel when you hear a composer playing his own music, do you feel he's creating it on the spot? Is this the excitement that you feel from him?" PA: "It's what I feel when I go to concerts.

As Mr. Buckley puts it, "Such is the pace of events in the Middle East that no conversation held about it on Monday appears to be relevant on Tuesday ... On the other hand, the causes of the tension do not change from day to day." The refugee camps are the main focus of discussion with this man who had made an indelible imprint with his internationally televised UN speech on the occasion of the Six-Day War. AE: "We have no guilt ... for that problem; not at all. We have responsibility with the rest of the international community. So, I am responsible in the measure that you are responsible, and we must all do what we can. But guilt, certainly not.

It is Mr. Brzezinski's thesis that the industrial age, "which, itself, produced many strains and tensions, did lead after a time to a number of coherent ideas as to how, more or less, to organize society, how to conduct international politics." But now, as we enter the "technetronic age," the new phenomena-but especially "the impact of modern communications, of modern means of calculations, of modern means of interacting"-have led to the breakdown of "established values, established institutions." And so we're off on a rich and, as it turns out, prophetic discussion of this "messy, congested, chaotic, fragmented, barely structured, partially orderly, partially disorderly" transition.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Allende is designated as the instrument for the scheduled totalitarianization of the state." Why Chile? Why this country where just six years earlier, as Miss Geyer tells it, "when Frei was elected ... there was a tremendously heady atmosphere ... a spontaneous outpouring of simple joy and relief on the part of the Chilean people that somehow they had voted for a reformist government without a Marxist government"? This proves to be an extremely rich discussion with two close observers of Latin America, explaining such matters as why there has to be, in Miss Geyer's phrase, "a conscious redistribution of wealth": "Largely because of the Spanish characteristics ... You have an economic system that is only an extension of family groups.... There is not much way for the aggressive young man to work in because he can't get credit; the banks are controlled by one family group-the credit goes to the people of that family."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This fascinating conversation explores the whole subject of decolonialization, including the limitations of Western democracy in a region accustomed to other methods of decision-making, and the question of how a colonial power should go about letting go. EH: "There does come a point when you've got to choose. Either you say, 'We'll wait for an ideal situation, when more people have had time to graduate from universities and there are more skilled people equipped to takeover the reins of government.' You can do this. Or you can say, 'That is worse...because it involves shooting a lot of people.' Then there is the question of any kind of future based on good will.

The discussion begins with the Wilson government's failure to reduce, as Mr. Grossman puts it, "the gap between the standard of living of the poor and the not-so-poor," given other problems such as the balance of payments; and goes back and forth between the practical and the theoretical. WFB: "What do you make of the criticism ... that socialism is in a sense an exercise in utopianism, and the balance of payments, mutatis mutandis, is always going to stand in the way of executing socialism. If it isn't that, it's going to be inflation, or it's going to be a lack of-" RC: "Yes. Well, you put it that way; I'll put it another way. I think socialism is the belief in the impossible. But then, you see, every good ideal is a belief in the impossible. Remember when he said, 'Credo quia impossibile'-Tertullian, the Christian, he said, 'I believe because it is impossible.' Now this is something I've always thought was the essential about a radical."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Our three questioners this time are all associated with the paper that, as WFB puts it, "is called, according as you sympathize with it or not, a great newspaper or a roving assassin at the service of socialists anywhere." Rapiers flash as we go from the prerogatives of the state to the politics of the American establishment to the Vietnam War. WFB: "Now, if you want to move from considerations of politics to considerations of ethics, I'm prepared to do so. But ring a bell and say we're moving from one area to another." JP: 'They have no relationship with each other in your field?" WFB: "Not in the view in which-not when I talk to adults.

The hour at first bogs down a little in hypotheticals, but we then get to a productive discussion of dual school systems versus de facto segregation, of racial balance versus simple desegregation, and of the beginnings of affirmative action. WFB: "Why should you be puzzled by what the Supreme Court would say? Is the Supreme Court that much of an enigma?" JL: "You asked the question. I didn't. I'm not puzzled. I'm sure-" WFB: "Suppose I were President of the United States and I called you and said, 'Mr. Leonard, here we've got a situation in which everybody who is black elected to go to this school, and everybody who is white elected to go to this one, tell me, since you are in charge of these matters, is that legal?' Would you say, 'God knows, Mr. President. It depends on what side of the bed the Supreme Court woke up today'?"

Topics range from the radicalism of Triumph (a Catholic magazine run by a sister and brother-in-law of Mr. Buckley's), to Chiang Kai-shek's failure to return triumphantly to Mainland China, to WFB's failure to criticize the Nixon Administration as roundly as he might have criticized a Humphrey Administration for similar actions. WFB: "I once said, if the whole country was engaged in a debate over whether we should demunicipalize the garbage collection, we wouldn't be talking about whether to socialize medicine.

Radical Chic, describing Leonard Bernstein's party for the Black Panthers, had roused the ire of the bien-pensants, led by Jason Epstein in The New York Review of Books. Mr. Buckley starts by asking, "Now when you read that passage [of Mr. Epstein's] did you feel guilty about how you handled the situation?" TW: "... He really wanted to establish the fact that somehow I was in league with...I believe he said Spiro Agnew, the Kent State grand jury ... No, somehow I couldn't bring myself to feel very guilty after reading that." And we're off on a joyous whirl through the current scene and the writer's craft.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Pike is a leading student of the Vietcong; Mr. Salisbury had notably reported from North Vietnam. They are not always prescient (DP: "To me this is largely academic now because in my opinion it just isn't in the cards for the Communists to win decisively") but are nonetheless deeply informative. HS: "My own feeling has always been that ... regardless of whether we should be there or shouldn't 't be there ... if the time comes when we're going to get out, we have a certain responsibility, perhaps you might say to humanity, to do it in an orderly fashion and to leave behind us the best possible ingredients which could be used in that part of the world towards stability and a better kind of social and political structure."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Although Messrs. Buckley and Hess had publicly used each other as bad examples, today's conversation is never bad-tempered. KH: "Hermits never socially organized. Ayn Rand never socially organized, perhaps. But anarchists ... left-wing or right-wing anarchists, so far as I know, would all agree that the point is people can socially organize volitionally; they do not need to live under established, institutionalized, self-perpetuating institutions of power."

WFB: "No, but the woman's body, as I understand it-at least this has been a point of view that has been accepted by women over the years, at least in many countries-the woman's body, after conception, becomes simply a carrier of something which is entitled to innate consideration."

And yet the public disturbances and general increase in crime made insurance all the more necessary. This show is less rambunctious than some recent ones, but it is a productive exploration of how private enterprise and the state might collaborate without the state's actually taking over the insurance function. CS: "The citizen himself has the obligation to use his ingenuity to protect that typewriter [the hypothetical stolen object Mr. Buckley had introduced into the conversation]; and there are ways in which that typewriter can be protected, whether it's a burglar-alarm system or whether it's some other system.

To mark the 50th anniversary, a Canadian film company had produced a documentary, Harvest of Despair. It won prize after prize at international festivals, but not a single American television network had seen fit to broadcast it. And so Firing Line undertook a special, with the first 15 minutes devoted to recapping the historical events, the next 55 minutes to viewing the film, and the final 50 minutes to commenting on it. A harrowing but riveting two hours. Mr. Conquest: "There are famines everywhere. But you look at this as the only famine where you don't see relief workers. No food, soup kitchens, nothing. Even in Ethiopia you see relief work." Mr. Kitchens: "I think that probably by 1933 one still hadn't entered the period of the 20th century when people were more inclined to believe the worst-I mean, would naturally believe that an atrocity was most likely to be true. I have a feeling that it was still relatively innocent."

Here they all are, the seven candidates for the 1988 Democratic nomination. This two-hour special is not a formal debate; instead, the candidates are asked questions in turn by Messrs. Buckley and Strauss; each had earlier provided a taped biographical segment; and each has a brief closing statement. As samples, three of the candidates' answers to the one question they had been given in advance. As Mr. Buckley states it, "In the Oval Office, there are portraits of five Presidents. Each President on moving in plays a little historical musical chairs, exiling one or two Presidents and repatriating substitutes. President Reagan has hanging the portraits of Jefferson, Lincoln, Taft, Coolidge, and Eisenhower.... Whom will you remove? Whom will you resurrect?" Mr. Jackson would put up Lyndon Baines Johnson: "As long as we have the public-accommodations bill and we have the voting rights act, we will have a Lyndon Baines Johnson." Senator Gore would hang Woodrow Wilson, FDR, and JFK, plus two Tennesseans: Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk (although he calls him James K. Knox). And Senator Simon would "like to see a steelworker from Pennsylvania and a coal miner. I would like to see a farm family there, a working mother..."

The first public meeting of all the candidates for the 1988 Republican nomination. As in the meeting of the Democrats four months earlier (FLS002), this show includes taped biographical segments, prepared closing statements, and lots of questions tossed at the candidates by Messrs. Strauss and Buckley, plus a segment of clips from past Firing Line appearances of each of the candidates. Of course, unlike the Democrats, these Republicans have to deal with the fact that they are striving to succeed a President of their own party, and one with whom they have all worked more or less closely. AH: "Well, I admire everything that George just said. But I would also suggest that when one is parceling out loyalty, that to me loyalty has always been having the courage to tell the man you work for what your conscience tells you he must hear, not what you think he wants to hear, and that's been my approach to every President I've served." ... RS: "On that first section, the film you had, I was interested that those candidates of yours, Bill, who were born poor sure stressed how poor they were, but none of your rich ones stressed how rich they were. Now if we Democrats could find a rich candidate we would be bragging about him all over the country." WFB: "May I have a show of hands among the candidates, which of you is wealthier than FDR, Jack Kennedy, or LBJ?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

A crackling debate with plenty of substance from start to finish. Mr. Buckley leads off for the affirmative by quoting Morton Kondracke to the effect that "Michael Dukakis's 'foreign policy is pure McGovern.' ... If [Jack Kennedy or Harry Truman] were sitting here tonight, there is simply no doubt on which side of the aisle they would stand: either with us, or else they would need to repudiate the whole of their public record." Mr. McGovern leads off for the negative: "Let's look at the record, a seventy-year record.... The Democrats under FDR opened up relations with the Soviet Union in 1933. The Republicans, under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, had no dealings with the Soviet Union. They didn't even recognize its existence. The Democrats under Roosevelt and Truman organized victory over Hitler, including the coalition with the Soviet Union, and I think all here can agree that without the huge Soviet army and the loss of 20 million Russian lives, it is doubtful that the West could have prevailed...." HK: "I must comment about the observation ... that the Democrats added the force of the Soviets to the anti-Hitler alliance. What added the force of the Soviets to the anti-Hitler alliance was Hitler, and the Soviets made the most strenuous efforts to avoid having to join."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: Jesse Jackson: "Since you call upon the Judaeo-Christian tradition, part of its challenge is to do justice and love mercy." Jack Kemp: "Absolutely." JJ: "Why do you oppose ERA for women and even vote against studying pay discrimination against women? Half the nation's poor children live in a house headed by a woman where there is no man...." JK: "What we want is a country in which any man, any woman, of any color, any background, has the opportunity to start a business, get a job, or to get an opportunity to get an education. That's equal opportunity, and I don't think the amendment has anything to do with it." JJ: "Even if a woman became President, it would not disprove the need for every woman to be free of discrimination based on sex." JK: "I couldn't disagree. And I'll tell you what, the first woman President is more likely to be a Republican than in your party, Mr. Jackson."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The guests on this high-voltage Firing Line Special all oppose sanctions ("We regret," Mr. Buckley notes, "that invitations to prominent advocates of sanctions to appear on this program, including Bishop Tutu and Allan Boesak and Cyril Ramaphosa, were not accepted"). On apartheid, however, they cover the waterfront from Mr. van der Merwe, whose party's principal plank was the maintenance of apartheid, to Mr. Dhlomo, Mr. Ngcoya, and Mrs. Suzman ("perhaps," as Mr. Buckley introduces her, "the most prominent white opponent of apartheid in South African politics, Alan Paton having died"), with, in the middle, Mr. Durr, as a member of the government that was gradually abolishing apartheid. OD: "We even say the destruction of apartheid for us is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end. The end is the system that must replace apartheid." HS:"A non-racial democracy." OD: "...

Much had happened behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains: perestroika and glasnost, the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan, a loosening of controls in China followed by Tiananmen Square. Does it all add up to an end to the Cold War? Mr. Buckley leads off for the skeptics: "Make no mistake about it: I and my colleagues greatly welcome the extent to which economic reality and spiritual yuppiness and Stinger missiles have put pressure on the Soviet government.... But can we persuade ourselves to believe that if Winston Churchill were here tonight-it was he, you will remember, who declared the Cold War-that he would say that this is, on existing evidence, coming to an end?" Mr. Solarz conies right back: "There may be some who find Mr. Buckley's prognostications of gloom and doom persuasive. But I suspect that there are others-such as Mr. Buckley's political heroes like Margaret Thatcher, who has said that the Cold War is already over, and Ronald Reagan, who was last seen kissing babies in Red Square-who would find them somewhat strange." This sizzling exchange takes us back to the early days of Lenin's rule and forward to the evolving Sino-Soviet rapprochement; we go from perestroika and glasnost to (courtesy of Mr. Perle) the number of SS-20s that have been dismantled under the INF treaty, but which are counterbalanced by new production of the "longer-range and more capable Soviet missile known as the SS-25."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As Mr. Kinsley sets the stage, "At a time when even the Communist world is turning to free markets, I don't think you can expect tonight's negative team to come out for socialism. But you can expect them to give the affirmatives a hard time about whether unfettered free markets are always the best solution in areas like corporate mergers, health care, the environment, and so on." Mr. McGovern duly steps up to the plate: "All of us believe in freedom. All of us believe in competition. No one of us advocated the centralized, state-run systems of the Communist or fascist worlds. So the question is, What is the debate all about? It is about whether there is a proper role for the government in protecting us against the excesses and the weaknesses of a big-business, free-enterprise economy." The argument sometimes bogs down in (often funny) ad hominem remarks, and in Mr. Kemp's tendency to bound along on his standard entrepreneurship speech; but Mrs. Kirkpatrick in particular has the gift of making the proper distinctions: "My question, Pat, is why are you so eager to mix something that doesn't work-that's an admitted evil in itself, like controls and taxes and regulations-with something that works reasonably well, namely a self-regulating market?" PS: "Well, I'm not sure what you mean that I am trying to mix." JJK: "You keep talking about the desirability of a mixed economy as though it were good in itself.... It may be a necessity in itself in our times, I'll buy that, but it isn't a good in itself."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Another skirmish in the Drug Wars. Mr. Buckley sets the stage: "Our team is not united on all aspects of the resolution, and you should know that it embarrasses us not at all if you single out differences in emphasis. For instance, I believe in capital punishment for anyone who conveys drugs to minors, while Mr. Ira Glasser, a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union, doesn't believe in capital punishment for Satan himself..." Mr. Buckley focuses on "$15 billion per year, jail cells for every third college student, a national obsession with a lost cause." Mrs. Schroeder comes out swinging: "I think indeed Bill Buckley has finally hit his midlife crisis.... I suppose I'm looking at this as a parent, but... I think too many people think the trouble with drugs is the crime that comes from that.... The trouble with drugs is also the use of drugs.... To say it's a victimless crime is really incorrect. It tears at the fabric of families, it tears at the whole society's fabric ..." Often heated but illuminating as well, as both sides have come well prepared.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Seven months after The Wall had come down, all Central Europe seemed to be jostling towards freedom, and German reunification was being talked about seriously--not, as Mr. Buckley points out, to the universal joy of Germany's neighbors: "Is there something there [in the German character] that is distinctively susceptible to the demagogy of people like Adolf Hitler, and if that is the case, are sufficient precautions being taken when we talk about German reunification?" He first addresses the man who is "probably better known in America than any German since Hitler, whose demons Mr. Kissinger’s parents protested by leaving Germany with their two young sons early in the Thirties." (Actually, Mr. Kissinger points out, it wasn't so much protest as sheer self-preservation.) Is there, WFB asks, "such thing as a German national character, or is that just a recent invention?" Mr. Kissinger replies that "every people is a product of its history, of its culture. ... I think the worry I have about Germany is not Auschwitz, but a certain kind of romantic, short-sighted national policy that brings about what they're seeking to avoid." To Mr. Pfluger, "The nightmare, the Holocaust, is, in my point of view, present in German thinking and in German feeling. We--and also the young generation--we know that we still have a responsibility, not for the past, but [so] that something like that will never happen in the future." And we're off on an extremely rich discussion that goes from Hitler to the Marshall Plan, from the composition of NATO to Gorbachev's growing problems.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley frames the question by reminding us that government's derelictions range from the murderous to the risible: "If Hitler hadn't had four hundred divisions, he would have been a routine anti-Semite like Gerald L. K. Smith; as much of a menace as a Ku Klux Klan, which we can cope with without the use of the atom bomb.... Do you know why everyone in New York who can do so communicates via messenger or Federal Express or fax? Because messengers and Federal Express and fax machines are not government enterprises like the Post Office." Mr. Weaver replies: "I think it was James Madison that said, 'If men were angels, no government would be necessary.' And since I fail to see any sets of wings in the audience or on the panelists, I really feel that government in some form is absolutely essential." A high-energy exchange that includes solid nuggets of information: e.g., from Rep. Schroeder: "I looked at what they did in Japan [in social-welfare agencies]... They give money to an agency at the beginning of the year to run the agency. At the end of the year, if there is money left over, then half the money is returned to the treasury, half the money is kept within the agency to pay out incentives, get more efficient equipment, or whatever. So for the first time you have taken government incentives and flipped them, so the incentive is to be efficient, not to be inefficient."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But unlike that other war [in the Persian Gulf] the drug war goes on." From Mr. Rangel's perspective, "If I thought for one moment that you [the affirmative side] were sincere about this, I would ask you to take a look at the children that are born addicted to drugs; to talk about those that find themselves in the emergency wards, if you will, Doctor, with the illnesses that are attributed to this." At times the participants are coming from different universes (HV: "Does illness increase or decrease a person's freedom?" IG: "... I don't think a person who is sick is more or less free against the government"), but the various personalities still bring life to this much-discussed topic.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Buckley sets the tone: "Ogden Nash once wrote that if the German people had had a more highly developed sense of humor, they'd never have let Hitler pull the wool over their eyes. The first time they saw someone goose-stepping and raising a stiff arm and shouting, 'Heil Hitler,' they'd have keeled over laughing, as most students will do when they think back on some of the affectations of the current age." Lots of fun as the Affirmatives recount ridiculous instances of the PC code and the Negatives recall racial and sexual vulgarisms in times past; but also some solid analysis from an academic perspective: GL: "I'm certainly not one standing here to say, 'I want to be free to make racist remarks in my classes.' What I think is the case, though, is that the cult of sensitivity has evolved in such a way that particular substantive issues of critical importance to be discussed cannot be discussed because particular insular minorities are exercising power, real power, to curtail the discussions that their feelings not be hurt."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Some people consider it a contained depression, perhaps the worst economic period since the Great Depression. And we don't really know what to do about it." Mr. Buckley thinks he does: "Bring back full employment by getting government out of the way." After all, "A lot of people say they can't build houses; they can't afford the interest. Why is interest so high? Because of inflation. Who causes inflation? Only the government can cause inflation. The private sector has never discovered how to do it." Mr. McGovern is equally sure that, say, the savings-and-loan crisis "is not the result of too much government intervention ... Rather it is the opposite: the result of too little regulation and monitoring that permitted irresponsible Sand L managers to rob that industry and the American public." Mrs. Schlafly takes up the cudgels against overreaching legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the latest Clean Air Act, and we're off on a vigorous exploration of what government can and can't reasonably do.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Buckley starts out by citing the fabulous amount of merchandise that came into our country last year, and then says, "Was it to crush us or to conquer us or to starve us? Or was it to nourish and enrich our country? It's a sober fact that every single item, however inconsiderable, in all that vast catalogue of commodities that came to our shores came because some citizen desired it, paid for it, and meant to turn it to his comfort or his profit." He then confesses that "that three-sentence description of free trade was done by Winston Churchill in 1908, and not a syllable of it would I for one wish to alter." Mr. Brown turns the tables on the conservative side by making the argument for subsidiarity and states' rights: "What is happening now is a proposal in the GATT treaty and in the Mexican-Canadian-North American treaty to set up tribunals that meet in secret that will be given the right to overrule state laws and congressional enactments."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

"Was Ronald Reagan wrong," asks Mr. Kinsley, "in what he said about the deficit 12 years ago, or was he wrong in what he did about it?" The usual fun and games among the debaters, but also plenty of substance on the history and theory of taxing, spending, and electing. To Mr. Thurow, "This motion is basically about an irrelevancy. There is only one task in the United States. The task is, How do you get America back on the track of raising the standard of living of everybody who is an American?" To Mr. Kuttner, "If that's the case [that 2 1/2 per cent growth is all we can normally expect], how did the OECD countries, during a period of less laissez-faire and more interventionism, how did we all manage 4 per cent growth for the quarter-century after World War II?"

This session is given extra authority by the presence of military people, as in this opening exchange: Colonel Ripley: "I would like to define combat as combat veterans see combat. First of all, combat is seen by the great majority so far, those in debates, those who have not experienced it, as a state of being, as essentially an act-a noun, if you will. On the contrary, those of us who have been in combat, particularly sustained combat... see combat as a verb, as something that must be done.... The word itself, to combat, suggests that you must take the fight to the enemy. You must in fact destroy the enemy. That's the whole purpose. You don't neutralize the enemy, you don't persuade the enemy; you kill the enemy." General Vaught: "I don't know how in the world we would exclude women from combat. We haven't been able to heretofore in the history of the world. So the question is not really whether women will be in combat-they have been, they will be. With each year the battlefield becomes more ill-defined, given the ever-changing kind of weapon technology that we have."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

We start with Mr. Buckley's relaxed view: "If the Religious Right were to prevail, would their success impede you in your endeavors? Well, if you make your living by making blue movies or producing pornography, you might find life a little harder than it used to be.... Does anybody in this audience fear that SAT scores would diminish if the Religious Right were successful? ... Will anyone here wake up sweating with fear because a rabbi has been asked to recite a prayer at the commencement of your son or daughter?"... HW: "You attended public schools yourself? JN: "Yes. West Hartford, Connecticut." HW: "Good. And did they have prayers in those schools?" JN: "All the time. My sister was the Virgin Mary year after year." PR: "She was Jewish, after all." HW: "... Senator Arlen Specter, when he would not support prayer in school, was talking about his personal discomfort as a young Jewish boy having to sit and listen to prayers and feel isolated-and I'm not just talking about Jews. There are Moslems, there are many other people."... JN: "You want to talk about rather trivial issues, and I am trying to get across a main point, which is that religion is not something that can be private, as Mr. Glasser said. Religion is something that forms your personality and tells you why you're alive. On that basis I favor separation of church and state, but I can't contemplate the separation of religion and politics."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

It was here at the University of Pennsylvania last year that a white freshman was charged with racial harassment for calling a group of black women 'water buffalo.' " It was also here, Mr. Buckley reminds us, that a group of students stole and destroyed copies of a student newspaper that carried an op-ed piece they disagreed with. But these cases make Penn far from atypical in the modern academic world, and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun had recently declared that "a fundamental right is the freedom from insult." Mr. Green starts by welcoming "any debate which forces conservative Republicans to become ACLUers in defense of the First Amendment." Today's debaters are occasionally a bit foggy over hypotheticals, but there are some fine exchanges. Professor Greene: "I think what we need to do is not to focus on calling each other racist or sexist, but instead to try to understand how historical racism has affected our lives and consciousness ..." Judge Bork: "Is it your understanding, Professor Greene, that you are actually defending political correctness with that statement?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

" Would he be on the Affirmative side in this debate? Mr. Buckley is quick to make a distinction: "We are gathered, my colleagues and I, to contend that welfare has done more harm than good. This is not to say that welfare has done only harm. A useful distinction here is between welfare, which can be an ongoing lifestyle, and relief, which is on the order of the kind of treatment one receives in an emergency room in a hospital." Ms. Norton comes out swinging: "I ask you, is the abused woman who has finally got the gumption to leave the house of abuse more harmed by welfare than if it were not there? Is the divorced woman in transition whose husband will not give her child support more harmed by welfare than not?" The spirited exchange gives some idea of the gulf between the two sides on this issue. Ms. Piven: "Why do you think a poor woman who is raising children surrenders her respect when she gets some support from the government, but that a much better-off woman, also raising children by herself-but with perhaps assets that she got from a divorce settlement-does not surrender her self-respect...." Mr. Woodson: "The difference is, the poor one has to then turn to taxpayers for support, and that's when you get other people involved in your business.... I think it's wrong to absolve people of personal responsibility. That's the kind of patronizing attitude that you get from people who believe that poor people don't have the ability to make decisions for themselves."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But on tonight's panel we have three people--Ms. Boleyn, Mr. Bright, and Mr. Stevenson--who have faced each other recently in court, and who bring the immediacy of those cases with them. Mr. Stevenson: "You are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty in the state of Georgia if the victim is white than if the victim is black. If the defendant is black and the victim is white, you are 22 times more likely to get the death penalty in Georgia...." Ms. Boleyn: "First of all, as I am sure you know, Mr. Stevenson, we have more white persons incarcerated on Death Row for murders than we do black people." BS: "How does that disprove that race is a factor? The bottom line is that only 27 per cent of the population of Georgia is black; yet 75 per cent of the people that have been executed in that state are African-American." SB: "... The honest answer to your question is that, first of all, as you well know, your statistics are wrong. The Baldus study was found to be nonsense ..."

This debate is not just about securing America's borders against illegal aliens. It's about cutting the total number of immigrants, both illegal and legal." Mr. Buckley points out the Scylla and Charybdis on immigration: "The great shadow that looms menacingly over one side is rank nativism, to stumble into saying, 'That man who wants to get into the United States is black, brown, or yellow, and we have enough of them' On the other side,... there are the libertarians who say, 'Anybody who wants to do anything should be permitted to do so, and if one of the things people want to do is to come live in the United States, why not?' That is one of the great disabling rhetorical limbs that get in the way of clear thought." Mr. Botstein, rebutting, says, "Today's debate is an experience in deja vu. We've heard the same refrains before: too many bad, different, new immigrants, as opposed to few good, old-style immigrants." But Mr. Brimelow does add something new: the information-publicly available but not widely noticed until he started writing about it-that our current patterns of immigration are not a natural occurrence: they are the result of "the peculiar workings of the 1965 Act. We must never forget that this is a policy, a government policy... There has never been a transformation like this in the history of the world. We're not saying that it won't necessarily work, but we're saying that it's a risk and the American people should be asked whether they want to take that risk. We should have a pause in immigration precisely to allow that great debate to take place."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

But a similar bill was stalled in the House through the efforts, Mr. Kinsley tells us, "of an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats ... concerned about the effect on civil liberties and constitutional rights." The bill would, among other things, expand penalties for terrorist crimes, including the death penalty; would create a special court to deport aliens suspected of terrorism; would broaden the permissible use of wiretaps; and would limit appeals of death sentences not just for terrorism but for all crimes. This sizzling debate covers some old territory (like the right to privacy and the right to bear arms) but also some new, like Mr. Zogby's statistics on the number of terrorist crimes committed by non-Arab, non-Muslim groups, such as Puerto Rican activists, anti-Castro Cubans, environmental and animal-rights groups, and Jewish extremists.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The version being propounded by Texas Congressman Dick Armey (and developed with the help of the National Center for Policy Analysis) would exempt from taxation the first $36,000 of annual income (for a couple with two children), and then tax all income over the threshold at 20 per cent. Period. No loopholes, no deductions. Mr. Buckley explains why the plan doesn't violate his criterion of equal treatment under the law: "Equal treatment under the law does not forbid amnesties, forbidding only class distinctions negative in character. It is one thing to say that an American who does not earn a living wage should be spared taxation, another to say that those who earn twice or more than twice a living wage should be penalized progressively." Mr. Thurow comes out swinging for the Negative side: "If you had a flat tax, it wouldn't be simpler [than the 1040 short form] because the problem is not deductions, but calculating your income. You are still going to have to calculate professional income,... you are still going to have to calculate your stock gains and losses. And if you look at deductions, a lot of them simply cannot be eliminated completely. Take the medical deduction. My first wife had a very serious illness and died, and I had a couple years when my medical bills were bigger than my total income. You're going to tell me I can't deduct them? ..." The participants have all come bristling with ammunition, and we swing bracingly from statistics to ethics and justice.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Today's debate addresses not only the usual question of free speech versus overriding public interest, but also the question whether it is physically possible to regulate the Internet. First-time Firing Line debater John Perry Barlow brings a perspective we aren't used to hearing: "I come to you from cyberspace, and that sounds to you like a ridiculous thing to say.... But I am telling you that there is a social space that includes the entire geographical area of the planet Earth and a fairly large and rapidly growing percentage of the earth's population.... Arid those folks are not vulnerable to the excesses of the United States Congress. We are free and sovereign from whatever the United States Congress may wish to impose on the rest of the human race....

If the marketplace is responsible, as it is, for 114 million Americans working, which is to say approximately 95 per cent of the working population, what system is it proposed that we introduce in its place? The Soviet Union tried to replace the marketplace and produced abject poverty and scarcity in a country the size of our own, with average earnings per person one-sixth of our own." Mr. Kuttner argues for something other than "an absolute, pure market.... We need capitalism, but we need in a good society a reasonable balance between market realms and extra-market realms, if only to help the market do what it does best." In this lively session, our debaters--including several new faces--go through job creation and downsizing, wealthy executives versus just-making-it working couples, the upward mobility of many American workers versus the case of Melinda Bagby, a skilled nurse, Mr. Stern tells us,who has received a total pay raise in the last seven years of 60 cents an hour.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Edley counters with a wealth of statistics, including those gleaned by "scientifically designed" studies showing "that 30 to 50 per cent of minorities [people of color and women] encounter some form of discrimination" in renting apartments or seeking jobs "when compared with otherwise identical white, male counterparts." Ms. Guinier details police departments' experience in hiring blacks, Puerto Ricans, and, and concludes: "The point is that no single rule predicts success, and no single criterion defines the job. If we understand this, we can learn to use affirmative action as a window, not a wedge." Mr. Connerly asks Mr. Edley, "Professor, how can you reconcile the view that you are opposed to preferences and then file-" CE: "What do you mean by preferences? I don't- I know that all of the Republican talking points that are faxed around say, 'Use the word "preference" as often as possible,' and they say 'Never talk about women, only talk about race.'

Why? Because "The Democrats live on illusions fortified by laws. The government will determine-you name it-whom you hire, whom you fire, whom you house, whom you reject, what you bill, what you pay, when you retire, what school your children will go to and what they can't be taught, what you grow and when you grow it, how much of what you earn you get to keep." Senator McGovern counters by taking us through the Republicans' deficit spending. In cross-examination, Speaker Gingrich gives a hilarious account of the House ice bucket; Rep. Andrews talks about "our grandparents and our mothers and fathers and the Medicare issue"; Mr. Kissinger reminds us that Republicans won the Cold War and that there are still dangers in the world. And then there's this exchange: Senator Hutchison: "Do you think President Clinton should seek approval from the United Nations to invade a foreign country, but not the United States Congress?" Mr. Shrum: "Well, of course not. That's a ridiculous question. Of course not. No one here thinks that." KBH: "Well, are you aware that he did that in Haiti? That he went to the United Nations to get permission, but never consulted with the United States Congress? Are you aware that there was mission creep-" RS: "We didn't invade a foreign- As Dr. Kissinger would probably tell you, because he conducted several of them, we weren't invading Haiti."

Buckley and Goodman suggest? Or is it, as Mr. Eisner puts it, "the system which has lifted the elderly out of poverty to at least the same extent as people of working age"? If we agree (which even the most optimistic of the participants do) that something will have to be done by about 2029, what should that "something" be? Waiting for the crisis to hit and raising taxes on that generation of workers? Or changing gears right now and following the Chilean example of privatization? Today's debaters sometimes talk past each other-e.g., to Mr. Goodman's complaint that encouraging a larger population, via higher birth rate or more immigration, doesn't solve the problem, Mr. Eisner answers: "The key to the best treatment of the elderly is to have the most prosperous economy." But they also came prepared with facts and figures, which they often impart in an arresting way. Mr. du Pont: "I do know that ... [for] any ten-year period in the history of the United States for the last 120 years, if you had invested your money on the first day of that ten years in the stock market, you would be better off on the last day than you would be under Social Security, and that is true even if you invested your money on the day before the crash of '29."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The affirmative side happily concedes the historic advances in environmentalist goals ... But we all recognize that pretty good movements sometimes end up in fanatical hands." Mr. Linden fires back that so far from going too far, environmental protection has encountered serious setbacks ever since the end of the Carter Administration. "The U.S. has had some successes: Delaware Bay has been cleaned up. In World War II, pilots could smell it at 5,000 feet, and it now supports a multi-billion-dollar recreational industry. I guess you could call that a giving rather than a taking." However, "The U.S. is one of 76 countries that have less than 1 per cent of their frontier forests remaining," and the destruction of species "is not just an amenity issue. [Species diversity] is vital for the functioning of ecosystems." And off we go on a fast-paced exchange over how much the incremental improvement in air quality is worth, how much we can do in this country given that pollution and greenhouse gases don't recognize borders, and whether environmentalism has been turned into a religion--with, from Mr. Brown, an argument based actually on religion: "Philosophers, theologians, for millennia have warned against pride, envy, greed, and gluttony.... When there were 250 million people in the world with spears and primitive tools, the impact was minimal. When there are six billion ... with powerful technologies and a philosophy of nonsatiety--never enough--we get the very problem that is the subject of this debate."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Should parents be able to choose which school their child attends? And if so, should they be assisted with taxpayers' money? A rousing exchange ranging from the bureaucratic inefficiencies of the public schools (WFB: "In Chicago,... 40 per cent of all students attend Catholic schools. How many non-teaching administrative jobs are required to do this? Thirty-six. You would then expect that the public schools would have ... 54. You would be wrong. The public schools in Chicago have 3,300 administrators") to, in Mr. Curry's phrase, the "root causes" of poor schools: "stratification of class and race in this country" ("Show me a school system where all the parents are in the top percentile of income and I'll show you a bunch of kids who, by and large, are on their way to Harvard. Show me a school system whose parents are in the bottom percentile of income, and I'll show you a bunch of kids on their way to jail"). And on through separation of church and state (Mr. Glasser: "Aha! And over 80 per cent of those kids are going to religious schools whose avowed purpose is not to educate those kids, but to propagate their faiths and convert those children"), to whether the private schools are guilty of cream-skimming (Brother Bob: "We've got students that have been expelled from other schools; I've got a student right now with brain damage. I've got students that are ED, LD--we've got everybody, and I'm not sure who else we should be looking for"), to how large a voucher has to be in order to do a poor family any good.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

For Mr. Buckley--who had had a widely publicized run-in with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Firing Line 239)--the fact that John J. Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, had in 1996 imposed a surcharge on members' dues, an extra $35 million to be directed, in his own words, "against Republican incumbents," and got away with it, means that "most union members either (a) don't know their rights [under the Supreme Court decision Beck v. Communication Workers of America] are being ignored or (b) are frightened to assert those rights." For Mr. Shrum, the fact that "since 1973, real income for American workers has been largely stagnant," even as corporate profits rose 15 per cent and "average CEO compensation in major companies soared by over 30 per cent," means that unions' "spending money in the campaign of 1996 [is] one of the most important things the AFL-CIO has done in years. They are fighting back." A rousing battle, with some of the shots coming from unusual angles, like this one from Mr. Williams: "Unions typically refer to the strike as their ultimate weapon. But the strike is not. Their real power is a result of their ability to use government or violence to prevent other workers from competing with union workers for jobs.... If unions could not prevent employers from hiring others in their places, all that a strike would be, would be a mass resignation."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Buckley leads off-after citing his own credentials as one who did not toast Chou En-lai in Peking in 1972-by welcom[ing] the evolution of China from the totalitarian state confronted by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in 1972 to the authoritarian state of today in which the Asian colossus dips its feet in the waters of economic freedom." To Mr. Bauer, "The truth is that tonight's debate is not really about trade, and, in fact, I do not believe ... [it has] that much to do with China. This debate tonight is about America, about who we are, and whether American values can still prevail..." Mr. Kissinger has a lifetime of cards to play: "As someone who spent his childhood in a totalitarian state and left from it as a refugee, I have a deep appreciation of the fundamental importance of American values ... But as somebody who had to conduct the foreign policy of the United States on behalf of two Presidents, I also have an appreciation of what is required to preserve the peace and to bring about the possibilities of progress in other countries". And we're off and running on a high-energy exchange that ranges from Tiananmen Square to China's trade surplus-and that occasionally skirts the borderline of civility, as in Mrs. Huffington's suggestion that Mr. Kissinger is motivated by personal financial interests (HK: "I regret that we have reached this sort of a point. Since you have done a lot of research, it would be easy for you to find out that my position on these issues has been the same before there were any commercial interests in China").</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Not everyone on the affirmative side embraces creation. What we contend is that everyone should acknowledge creation as an alternative explanation for cosmic and biological happenings now thought by so many as naturalist in provenance and momentum." Mr. Lynn replies that "none of us on this team have any doubt that we have all been created somehow. Where we disagree with Mr. Buckley and his colleagues is on the relationships between evolution and our current situation." And we're off on a profound debate that ranges from the molecule to the cosmos, with distinctions that may be surprising to the layman (e.g., from Ms. Scott, between evolution and Darwinism: "Darwinism is evolution through natural selection")-and quite a lot of fun along the way: Mr. Berlinski: "The gravamen of your argument is the chordate."

However, he and his colleagues will "contend that the Republican Party is better oriented than the Democratic Party to do two things. The first and most important is to stay out of the way of upward-bound black Americans by minimizing the great burdens of regulations and taxation and military service. The second is to pull back from the catastrophic effects of the welfare state." Mr. Shrum takes off the gloves in his opening statement: "So now comes William F. Buckley Jr.-the fierce opponent of Brown v. Board of Education, the writer who penned jeremiads against the 1964 Civil Rights Act-to offer African Americans the tender mercies of the Republican Party. My reaction is, 'Beware of a reactionary bearing such gifts.'" The debaters sometimes talk past each other (CE: "Mr. Franks, are you saying that the War on Poverty was just a big mistake?" GF: "I am saying that the record is pretty clear as far as the separation of the family." CE: "So your position is;-" GF: "Trillions of dollars have been spent.

That's true. Free speech defined as the right of Deep Throat--and, who knows?, maybe even snuff films--to the airwaves; freedom of religion defined as forbidding the Ten Commandments to be viewed in a courthouse or crosses or menorahs to be exhibited on public property; and criminal law defined as the right of criminals to escape imprisonment because the arresting officer didn't brush his teeth that morning." Ms. Strossen starts out taking the high road: "The ACLU's mission is unique and critically important: to defend all fundamental freedoms for all people in this country. We pursue this broad mission because we have learned through experience that all rights are indivisible, that if the government is ever ceded the power to violate one right of one person or group, then no right is safe for any person or group." And that is why the ACLU takes up some of the cases that Messrs. Buckley and Graglia zestfully cite--in favor of the 14-year-old girl who wished to decorate her school clothes with condom packages, against the Detroit school board's installing metal detectors at the entrances of its weapon-infested schools. And on--often at the shouting level--to AIDS and vouchers and homosexual Boy Scout leaders.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Instead, all the participants agree that Castro is a tyrant whom the world would be better off without; the point at issue-often heatedly-is (a) whether the embargo has any chance of bringing him down, (b) whether in hurting Castro it is hurting the Cuban people more-and, derivatively, (c) whether it hurts the United States. Mr. Duran: "You keep insisting on the embargo to punish the Castro regime. The embargo is punishing the people of Cuba. ... You are condemning to malnutrition and to sickness a whole generation of Cubans. That is an immoral policy for this country; that is an inhuman policy for this country." ... RT: "I believe that the embargo makes a very important point to the Cuban people of the lack of legitimacy of their government.

In constant dollars we have spent $5 trillion on welfare, yet the percentage of the American people technically below the poverty line is about the same. In identical constant dollars we fought the Second World War at a cost of $3 trillion. The haunting indictment of our experiences with the welfare state is that (a) more human welfare could be achieved without it, and (b) it has, in fact, helped to corrode the great aspirations of our country." Mr. Galbraith, taking up the baton of his father, John Kenneth, responds: "My friend Bill Buckley, who was once a conservative, tonight plays the role of the radical, the abolitionist, the William Lloyd Garrison of the welfare state. What would he abolish? Not poverty, not insecurity, not the fear effacing illness without the means to pay for doctors, not the penury of a penniless old age. No. He would abolish precisely those institutions that protect Americans from those evils ..."

For the same reason, Mr. McCloskey had announced that he would challenge the President for the 1972 Republican nomination. (As it happens, by the time of the New Hampshire primary Mr. Buckley was backing John Ashbrook for the Republican nomination-not because of Vietnam but because of President Nixon's trip to China.)

The point at issue was the refusal of the Republicans in Albany to sign off on the pension plan agreed to between the City of New York and Mr. Gotbaum's union.

Mr. Dellums was not in Congress when the initial list was presented, but he had since become a leading member of the Caucus. Where this show fails as conversation it nonetheless succeeds as an encapsulation of a moment in our political history. RD: "We don't see ourselves as being party loyalists. The problems that confront blacks and browns and reds and yellows and poor people and women and young people in this country go far beyond partisan politics. I don't see myself in the United States Congress as being loyal to the Democratic Party. I'd like to hope that I have enough integrity and enough courage to be loyal to people in this country who desperately need to have their problems solved."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "Can I proceed on the assumption that you can distinguish between a declaration of war passed by both Houses of Congress pursuant to an attempt to save the world from the Axis powers; to defend the Jewish population of Germany, to the extent that it could be done; to save people from the Axis aggressions against China-can you distinguish between that and somebody burning down a building in protest against social policies that call for building a gymnasium in that university? Is that a distinction?" WK: "You usually don't help me so much. You've given me my answer. Because what you've really said is that under certain circumstances any form of arson, mayhem, bombing is justifiable, and you've given an example of World War II.

SH: "The fact is, they're dying. And I can't make up my mind. You know, the more you know about some of these officers and some of the, certainly about the enlisted men, it's really hard to say whether something- You know, Calley was guilty of murder, certainly.

Rep. Mills had reportedly referred to the plan as "a gratuity in a will signed by a pauper." Mr. Buckley's first question is, "Why is the government a pauper, and ... who pauperized it?" The ensuing discussion, full of detail, ranges from deficit spending to forms of taxation to the congressional committee system. WM: "I feel very strongly that you don't get better government at any level if you split these two responsibilities, because there is this joint responsibility, I think, to raise that which you spend and to spend that which you raise."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The three officers, our guests on this show, state that they never witnessed or were told at close hand of any such incidents. Their purpose in going public was, as Captain Bender puts it, "primarily ... a concern that the families of our own men-and myself, thinking of the 216 enlisted men that served in my rifle platoon over the nine and a half months that I commanded it, and the 17 officers who were rotated through my company while I was in Vietnam,...

SW: "I think that Augustine is one of the most relevant of the ancients for our day simply because he was probably one of the most honest men of the ancient world. The ... way he describes his inner life in his search for God, to me, is one of the most captivating and revealing sequences in the history of literature." ...

It was not expected to go far--but in 1970 it sent James Lane Buckley to the United States Senate. Actually, in response to the title question, the Senator says it isn't particularly difficult being a conservative in the Senate: "I think I'm regarded, still, a little bit as a curiosity, but I'm sort of feeling my way around and finding my place--not being put in my place, I might add. And, no, I think I'm just accepted as a member of the team.... The Senate has a very interesting air of total civility, so that, I think, if you aren't more or less apt to be naturally civil, there's something about the atmosphere that causes you to abide by the ground rules." A genial, instructive conversation about the workings of a third party, the demands on a large-state senator, and Mr. Nixon's "full-employment budget."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

It certainly isn't boredom. It isn't a sense of impotence. It isn't a sense of futility. It isn't a sense of misanthropy. And it isn't a sense of self-hate, either...." JD: "I was in Australia three years ago, and it seemed to me ... Australia is like America was when we had a great feeling of hope and promise and possibility. They still have their frontier down there. I think the thing that's eaten us up in America is excessive introspection and the questioning of every motive so that you can't do the simplest thing without being made aware that there's a certain amount of guilt that attaches to it." He tells about a commencement address he's writing, to be titled "How Can You Possibly?" subtitled "Reflections on Guilt, Joy, and the Quality of Life," "And the opening sentence of the address is, 'How can you possibly stand there eating that ice-cream cone when children are being firebombed in Vietnam?'

The conversation begins there (WWR: "I think I can say that my views about Asia, from which derived my views about Vietnam,were formed long before I had the privilege of working with President Johnson"), but ranges across the foreign-policy scene at this critical juncture, just a few months before Nixon's visit to China and the beginning of detente with the Soviet Union, and in the midst, as we would later learn, of the secret talks in Paris to end the Vietnam War."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The conversation turns at times to technical points of judicial behavior and self-policing by British barristers; but there are also fascinating reflections on British history. For example, when Mr. Buckley raises the matter of the turmoil on American campuses, Sir Peter agrees that Britain hasn't seen its like recently--but he adds: "You always remember, though, the great sort of riots in London. They were usually by the apprentices. They were great mobs in the 18th century, and Wellington's hat being knocked off and Lord North's coat jacket cut into bits, and the windows being broken. And that was, after all, not so very long ago.... I don't know. Perhaps in my generation, having been very early confronted with violence in war, one has the greatest contempt for those people who are driven to violence, unless the circumstances are such that they are utterly intolerable."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A sharp duel between a self-described populist who believes, for example, that "the very portions of Lyndon Johnson's program that President Nixon is trying to wind down--like Legal Services--are the parts that have worked best. WFB: And what is the interest that Mr. Nixon has in the maldistribution of power?" FH: "I think he likes it the way it is."WFB: "Why?" FH: "Well, it serves him very well.

Senator Proxmire goes on, in this lively conversation, to demonstrate that his tastes for economy, whether or not one agrees with every particular, are well informed: "Well, I think it's very, very hard to justify-from an economic standpoint, from a military standpoint-building a supersonic B-l whose only unique function, really, would be to gravity-drop a bomb over Russia, when you can retrofit with new engines and a SCAD missile the B-52s, and they'd be far more economically effective, and they could do the job. They could stand off and provide a platform for launching missiles at the Soviet Union much, much cheaper, and do the job." WFB: "I see. So your objection isn't to our capability to get the job done, but to an unnecessary vehicle for getting the job done." WP: "Exactly.

Mr. Jackson-dressed not in jacket and tie but in a boldly patterned T-shirt-proceeds to demonstrate what his host means, with his rapid-fire disquisitions on the civil-rights movement, on the current state of the cities, and much more. One sample: "One cannot see the Public Accommodations Bill-which moves toward some universal respect for one's person in America-apart from the jailings and the bombings in Birmingham, Alabama, and the assassination [of Martin Luther King]....

Six weeks after the magazine hit the streets, the defendants had been tried, convicted, and jailed, which suits Mr. John Selwyn Gummer just fine." Mrs. Short, while "not pro-pornography, [is] anti-anti-pornography legislation." RS: "I think that one can really leave society to look after this problem reasonably successfully. I think that what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own places is their business...." JSG: "I find it very odd. Mrs. Short's the first one to say you can't leave it to individuals to decide whether to put up ugly buildings or not. They have, evidently, to be stopped from doing that, and they have to be stopped from polluting the environment...

This was, as Mr. Bush tells us, the first time the UN had ever expelled a country-"something that our opponents said wasn't happening,... because they were maintaining that we were talking about restoration of the legal rights" of Peking-and it was seen, as WFB puts it, "as the crystallization within the United Nations of a working anti-American majority." An informative discussion of how Mr. Bush sought to prevent this outcome ("I wish I could say on the air ... a beautiful Texas expression" that General Romulo [Foreign Secretary of the Philippines) had used), and how Mr. Loh's government reconciles its one-China policy with its friends' attempts to have both it and Peking represented in the General Assembly.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The resulting book had just now been published. Her findings: that the networks are indeed biased in a left-liberal way, and that the network executives know it even though they deny it. How much does it matter? "The situation is enormously dangerous because so long as you have actual bias on the air of a publicly owned medium, which is supposedly regulated by a fairness doctrine, and then huge numbers of citizens are aware of this bias and are intensely angered by it, it is a set-up for an assault on the First Amendment from which we might not recover."

One sample, on Nixon's speech on the Cambodian incursion: RDN: "I think he is a man of many heroes, some of them conflicting in nature. I think he wants to be Winston Churchill, at times. I think he wants to be the resolute leader of a nation-confronting great military odds, mobilizing a heterogeneous people into one, to combat the enemy. Unfortunately, or fortunately, those times are not here, and it becomes a little ridiculous when you make a rather small military operation seem like the Normandy invasion." RE: "You read that speech today, out of context, and it really is melodramatic. And you realize, at the same time, that the President was seeing the movie about Patton over and over again, and that this was part of this same-" WFB: "You said 'over and over again.'

JAL: "[President Nixon] is reliably-I think reliably-reported to have used a four-letter word which I presume we can no more use here than the newspapers could use it..." WFB: "...

Edgar Smith had been convicted 14 years earlier of the murder of a 15-year-old girl and sentenced to death; twice he came within hours of being executed but was rescued by resourceful lawyers. He was, WFB tells us, "in the death house longer than anyone in the history of the United States," and during that time he taught himself law and wrote a book, Brief against Death, which convinced many people, including Mr. Buckley and the Washington lawyer Steve Umin, that he was in fact innocent. An hour and a half before this taping, Mr. Smith was discharged from the death house at Trenton, N.J., after pleading guilty to a lesser charge (only because, he claims, of the extraordinary difficulties a new jury trial at this remove of time would pose). He speaks movingly about his time in prison, how he was convicted in the first place, and where he goes from here ("At the present time, I'm trying to believe the fact that I'm not still in the death house. It's very difficult").</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

You answered, 'Yes.' And tonight in this studio, you said you had to do what you felt you' had to do to gain your freedom.... Mr. Buckley, why are you so convinced that he is innocent, after what you heard today in court?" WFB: "Well, what I heard today in court was a protracted yawn. The judge simply condensed what I first read in 1961...." RS: "You're convinced that he's innocent?" WFB: "I told you that." RS: "Then he committed perjury today." WFB: "Well, do you want to send him to jail for that?" RS: "No. No, but you see the point I'm trying to make." That point keeps recurring, although there is also illuminating discussion of the way prisons are run, the advisability of having press coverage of trials, and the Anglo-American adversary system of jurisprudence".

How does it all fit in with free speech? How much is mere voyeurism? Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers come into the discussion, as do the New York Times rule, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and lie-detector tests. WFB: "It seems to me that this makes everybody's property everybody else's property, because we are involved in mankind ... Since the ripples from a communication between A and B can very easily affect C, either you do assert the right of A to privacy or you've had it, I think."

"There is much speculation about all of this," Mr. Buckley begins. "How will they vote? How will they affect national and state elections? Ought they to vote while at college?" Our eight students today are more articulate than many student panelists, and while Vietnam keeps coming up, so do questions of domestic policy and more general questions of political philosophy. Miss Westbrook: "... that, I think, relates back to my first statement, that young people have given up. I think that it has to go further than the vote."

There are those who believe that however sensible the concept is, in fact, what it comes down to is that the United States needed to concoct a grand chimera, under the cover of which to pull away from what we used to refer to as our obligations under the SEATO treaty." As a veteran diplomat (starting with his posting to Argentina by President Truman, and continuing under Republican and Democratic Presidents ever since), Mr. Bunker is well able to turn aside a question so smoothly that you hardly realize he has sidestepped; but once he gets into the subject of the training of the ARVN [Army of the Republic of Viet-Nam], and the intransigence of the North Vietnamese and their Soviet and Chinese backers, he is eloquent. "This war was new to the American experience.... Korea wasn't like this; World War II was not like this.... Therefore, we had to learn to fight this war as we went along, in the hard way. It took some time to come to the realization that there wasn't the military war and the other [political and psychological] war. It was all one war. The thing, I think, that brought this home to us, dramatically, was Tet '68, which was a major military defeat for the enemy here, but a major psychological victory for him in the United States."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

When the conversation ranges further afield, he comes up with some unexpected delights: "They say, still, that the constitution of the Fifth Republic is the shortest in the French history.

They give vivid accounts of what they found there, starting with Mr. Osnos's surprise when he first arrived ("When you get off the plane, somehow, you expect to have to duck, mortars flying, and it's not like that at all"), and Mr. McArthur's account of how he went about assigning stories: "Everything had a tendency to get covered if you simply left it alone with ten more or less energetic newsmen doing the job. And you wouldn't say, 'Go do me atrocity stories,' or 'Go do me a pacification story' ... Occasionally you'd make some specific assignments, but it wasn't in some limited field or some limited range of what you might call emotional appeal."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Firing Line #167] and what happened and didn't happen in East Bengal. Here again, in Biafra, people were massacred without anybody interfering, and the Pakistanis were able to massacre people in East Bengal without anybody interfering, and what earthly reason is there to suppose that if we ever allowed anybody to be in a position to massacre us, that anybody would interfere? There are not so many people [in Israel]; it could be over pretty quickly, and everybody would wring their hands."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Ashbrook and McCloskey were both challenging President Nixon in the primary to be held the following week, the latter because of the Vietnam War, the former because, as WFB puts it, "his support for Richard Nixon in 1968 was based on a number of positions concerning social and international issues which Mr. Nixon no longer holds, but John Ashbrook does." (For the record, Mr. Buckley and his magazine, National Review, were supporting Mr. Ashbrook's effort.) A sparkling exchange, with substance--re Vietnam, and Nixon's just-concluded visit to China, and fiscal responsibility--as well as fun and games. PM: "Well, I don't consider joining the Democratic Party, and I think the significant differences used to be that we were the party of the individual, small business, small farmers..." WFB: " 'We' being Republicans?" PM: "We used to be the party of fiscal responsibility. And I feel more comfortable as a Republican than I do with men like Mayor Daley or John Stennis or Jim Eastland, who..." WFB: "Or John Lindsay?" PM: "Well, I like John Lindsay, but I..." WFB: "We weren't talking about the romantic aspects." PM: "If that's romance, then I'm in trouble."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "Now, I understand you to ask the questions: Is it really wrong that a central authority should tell this professor what to study, and this guy what books to write? And the very fact that you consider this an open question is remarkable and says a great deal about your appreciation of China, suggesting that we are a way station to Orwell." RT: "Let me tell you why I ask the questions: because I think we don't approach China from a fixed point, as if our world is settled and beyond criticism.... And I want people to think about their own society at the same time as they think about China. In the past, we've looked at China as a kind of exotic area--as if, indeed, it were another planet--without thinking that there were points, problems with points, about our own country as well."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

To Mr. Buckley, "contemplating the recently discovered genocide in Bangladesh, the eyes and ears of the world are strangely, perversely dull, since no one, that I know of, suspected that the killing was on such a scale." To Mr. Conquest, "I don't think one does know exactly the scale of these things till years later." The operative question, for him, is whether we're attempting to find out what is happening, or whether we judge according to "which side has the best publicity machinery." One sample: WFB: "If I were to arrive at, say, the Daily Telegraph office here with a first-hand account of 100,000 people slaughtered in, say, Brazil, what kind of treatment would my account get in the next morning's papers?" RC: "... The first question is: Who did the killing? . . . Even leaving aside the question of taking ideological stances on the matter, I'd have thought that a million killed in Bengal would be about the same news as, say, a couple of hundred thousand killed in Brazil, which again would be about the same news as four killed in Kent State." WFB: "Or thirteen in Londonderry."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

BD:"You'd think by now we'd know it doesn't work." WFB: "...have an imperfect system suggests one of two things: one is that..." BD: "I do suggest one thing: that we scrap the whole system and try another one. This one evidently doesn't work." WFB: "Yeah, that's your suggestion.

This proves to be a surprisingly rich hour, though with a certain surrealism. OM: "I've admitted that the other fascist states--I don't think it would have been so true, if I had won here--did ignore liberty and they did great damage. Mussolini had his Lipari Islands and people interned. They did then, in time of peace, what was done to me... in time of war." ... "Do you really think that flowery speeches like that [Churchill's at Yalta saying that Stalin was "a friend whom we can trust"]... had any effect on a man who had gone the long and dusty road from Siberia to the Kremlin, or that he could be won over by Mr. Churchill drinking his toast? The whole concept was ridiculous, and no wonder clever and able and shrewd American conservatives like Mr. Buckley are alarmed when Mr. Nixon goes to China and has feasts and all the rest of it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A freewheeling, at times boisterous discussion of everything from the supersonic transport to Vietnam to unemployment--sometimes all in one paragraph. PR: "When you're, for instance, an aerospace worker who's kicked out of a job, who's used to earning $10,000 plus at least..." WFB: "Which is a good argument for escalation in Vietnam..." PR: "No, it's not a good argument for escalation in Vietnam. It's perhaps a good argument for building supersonic jets so that the Rockefellers can fly between Paris and New York all the time." WFB: "Well, that was your decision, not ours...." HM: "And you mentioned Vietnam ..." PR: "The aerospace worker who's out of work--you can't say that he should go along and answer any help-wanted ad to become a cook." WFB: "Oh, but I most emphatically do....

One sample, on the question of how useful Greece would be as an ally. AP: "Hitler had to come down--in fact, delay his whole schedule for attacking the east--in order to confront these literally, practically, unarmed soldiers. It's not very different from Vietnam, by the way. When there is soul in a struggle--" WFB: "Are you suggesting there wouldn't be soul in a struggle against the Soviet Union?" AP: "I am not suggesting that. I think there would be soul in Greece in the struggle against any occupation force, whether it was red, blue, green, or white colors. And this is why we are fighting today against what we consider to be a military occupation of Greece, not an internal dictatorship but a military occupation of Greece by NATO and under the guidance of the Pentagon."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

We begin with the February 28 Shanghai Communique (which in Mr. Mozingo's view "seeks to get rid of two fallacies...that Taiwan speaks for the government of Mainland China, and second, that the United States, by an overt and forward policy of identification with Taiwan, engages itself in the still existent question of the civil war") and go on to, among other things, the Communique's effect on japan. RLW: "We have, so to speak, cut Japan adrift. Now, Japan is, as Brzezinski describes it, a 'fragile flower.' One of the big questions is the matter of style, the way in which it was done...They thought they had a firm agreement in writing from Secretary of State Rusk that we would not make any dramatic moves in our China policy...without intimate and detailed consultation." The discussion is sometimes a bit technical for a non-China hand, but there are some delicious anecdotes.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "Would [you] consider it unprofessional to raise your hand and say, 'For Heaven's sake, everybody stop drinking'?" JH: "No, I don't think it would be unprofessional of me to say so, but I think it would be unrealistic of me to say so, and I couldn't in good conscience say so." For Father Sweisgood (who had been personally affected by his father's and his own alcoholism, and who says, "If I could drink, I would drink"), "I've stopped looking at the many, many people who can use it well and I'm very concerned about the people who are dying from it.... You've got a much better chance of stopping him [a young man just starting to have a drinking problem] if you tell him the truth in a credible way, either before he crosses the line of loss of control or, once having crossed it, knowing, 'Look, this is a disease.

By happy coincidence for [today's guests], they brought out during the same season a book on the new populism called A Populist Manifesto: The Making of a New Majority."

The Israelis, obviously, had not been thrilled, but neither had the militant Pan-Arabs. Mr. Sharaf, as befits a diplomat, discusses this and other questions calmly but with some eloquence: "... in the United States, as well as in Europe and in the West generally, there is a basic misconception with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict which stems from some emotional associations--a sense of guilt with regard to what happened to the Jews in the West and a wrong identification of that question with the Israeli question in the Middle East, where the situation is actually reversed.

WFB begins by asking whether he is "in favor of doing anything to the Soviet Union in any way different from what the Soviet Union routinely does to us." LB: "No." WFB: "Have you no imagination?" LB: "I should like to be more successful. But the Soviet Union plays in our back yards; I merely propose that we play in theirs." Mr. Barth won't go so far as to characterize this idea as "offensive," but he does believe that "it would present, to be blunt about it, sir, a graver danger of subverting the character of the United States than of subverting the character of the Soviet Union or China, or any other country to which it were directed." And we're off on a heady discussion with historical illustrations stretching back to Hitler, Lenin, and Queen Elizabeth I.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It is less obvious that there are still others to the right of Nixon (if that is the word for it), who are a strange, quiet, but fascinating complement to the McGovern people." We have met Mr. Hukari before (Firing Line 181); on that occasion he was the lone right-winger in a sea of left-wing radicals. Mr. Rohrabacher would a decade later become a speechwriter for President Reagan; in 1988 he would win a congressional seat from his native California. The two RNC chaps start out judiciously with polling data on young people; the fun starts when the libertarians jump in: HH: "One notices that the only kind of literature that the campaign committee ... distributes says, 'Re-elect the President'; they never remind you that the President's name is Richard M. Nixon. And there's a very good reason for that: because they've taken a poll that shows more people are in favor of re-electing the President than are in favor of re-electing Richard M. Nixon." WFB: "When you say, 'Long live the Queen,' you don't say, 'Long live Queen Elizabeth.' Isn't that just sort of a way of doing things?" HH: "I don't know. I think there's something more conspiratorial behind it."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"There are few hotter subjects facing the local legislatures," as WFB puts it, "and for once there isn't a clear-cut liberal-conservative division." Although our two guests are decidedly on opposite sides of the fence, this is less a debate than a thoughtful exploration of the concepts of "specific" and "general" damages, how the different sorts of no-fault laws might work, and whom they benefit and whom they harm. Mr. Lewis, for example, outlines the hypothetical of a woman who suffers a severe sprain of her upper neck and back, but no fracture. It may take her months to be able to pick up her child or do housework without pain, but "under even the Massachusetts bill, what she would receive is $380, which are her bills; but no matter how negligent was the person who injured her, she could not recover those damages for her inconvenience, her pain, her suffering, and her disability."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB (after Mr. Valenti has played the gigue from Bach's B-flat Partita): "Wow! Was the hand crossing supposed to be in any sense exhibitionistic, or does the music just make it impossible to accomplish in any other way?" FV: "Well, it's a little bit of both. It certainly is supposed to have a visual impact on the audience, and it's sheer ham.... Some pieces can actually be played, some of the most famous hand-crossing incidents in the Baroque era, without crossing your hands." WFB: "You mean by refingering and so on?" FV: "Yes, you can play your notes and be faithful to the score without this pretzel-shaped operation ... However, it doesn't sound the same, which leads one to believe that... the kinesthetic thrill, the danger of missing the note--which one very, very often does--does something to the performer and does something to the piece.... The reason I know is because we have tried this experiment with some hand-crossing pieces on tape, where you can't actually see the performer ... and you can hear the difference."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"I regret to report," WFB begins, "that there is no generation gap between father and sons." A wild and woolly hour, with the junior Galbraiths proving frighteningly articulate and sharing their father's style of humor. WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Jamie: If the convention declines to nominate Mr. McGovern and McGovern strikes out on his own, will you also bolt the party?" JG: "I don't think that's a very likely possibility." WFB: "I didn't ask you that." JG: "If the convention were to deny George McGovern the nomination on the basis of the steal of the delegates from California, I would not support the nominee and I would probably work for George McGovern should he choose to run on another ticket. But again, I think that's an entirely hypothetical question." WFB: "I don't mind asking you hypothetical questions." JKG: "You wouldn't want to comment on this larceny, would you, Bill?

The discussion on this show is technical, but host and guests use specifics well to keep the audience in the picture. WFB: "When we use the word 'de-stabilizing,' it seems to me that we fall quite commonly into the error of [forgetting] ... that we do not ourselves plot an offensive war and, under the circumstances, that which de-stabilizes us is of no particular strategic consequences--only that which de-stabilizes them." FC: "Well, that is one of your statements that sounds very profound but which doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense at all..." WFB: "We're not going to attack Moscow, are we?" FC: "...because, look, given the arsenals that had been built up on both sides, given the capacity that each side has to utterly destroy the other, this kind of war between the United States and the Soviet Union is an insanity." ...

An illuminating discussion, primarily of how treaties work, from Bretton Woods to SEATO and NATO. RJ: "We never did march side by side with you in Vietnam."WFB: "In a sense you did."

It was Mr. Ellsberg who in 1971 had turned the secret papers over to the Washington Post and the New York Times; the Supreme Court had ruled that the newspapers had the right to publish them, but, as Mr. Buckley phrases it, "that decision ... did not derivatively exonerate those who gave the classified material" to them, and at the time of this show, Mr. Ellsberg was on trial. To Mr. Buckley's first question--whether his guest had immunity for anything he might say in the next hour--Mr. Ellsberg replies: "Well, you haven't come to an expert. I'm a beginner at being a defendant, and all I know is what I've heard in court, really."

(Still in the future: the official shortening of our guest's name to Tony Benn in a populist-tinged pursuit of the prime ministership.)

This free-swinging exchange goes from polls to primaries to economics to defense. WFB: "I agree with you, and I think as Mr. McGovern turns away from the surrealism of his position over the last year and a half, he will increase his vote. It's true that there are certain people who are going to be disillusioned with him. The Platonists, who were attracted to him because they thought of him as sort of a convulsive redistributionist, may feel that he is now playing with practical politicians."

This time around the percentage was expected to be much lower, perhaps as low as 50 per cent. Is it purely because of Israel? "No: there are also the quotas being ushered in by affirmative action, and the Cold War apart from Israel; also, as Mr. Perlmutter (who has witnessed the phenomenon close up in his new role at Brandeis) puts it, the very look--yes, the very look-of people who are shouters. The demagoguery that I used to associate with the far Right, the simplistic sloganeering, I'm more apt to recognize today in the extreme reaches of the Left." Host and guests take a vivid side trip to Italy in 1948 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 in exploration of what Jews mean by worrying, re Israel, as Mr. Perlmutter puts it, "whether or not this nation will continue to live."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The two sides in this debate can agree that, as Professor van den Haag puts it, "even if you present five different value systems and present them, so to speak, neutrally, the major effect on the student would be, 'It doesn't matter,' which is another value system." But as to the place of sex education in the schools, never the twain shall meet. EvdH: "I agree with Dr. Fort that there is a great deal of learning, if not formal education, about sex going on from all kinds of sources. Under the circumstances, why is it necessary also to teach it in schools?" MC: "As a corrective." JF: "Because most of that is not good information."

The journeys to Peking and Moscow were, perhaps, slightly less popular in France than in the United States, but were rather popular." WFB: "Why?"

But the case challenging that veto would probably never make it to the Supreme Court, Mr. Lucas explains, for there were others ahead of it in line; in retrospect, we know that one of those, Roe v. Wade, was decided in January of 1973. This show covers familiar ground, but often from angles that are still fresh thirty years later. RL: "Would you favor legislation requiring a woman to submit to strong medical treatment to stop spontaneous abortion and penalizing her accordingly if she didn't? ..." JTN: "No, I think you're again committing what I would say was a fault in moral reasoning. Because you're bound to avoid doing some injury to a person does not mean that you're bound to do everything possible in the world to help him."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: In the wake of President Nixon's trip to Moscow, WFB asks his guest about his own abortive trip to Moscow in 1959, for a meeting with Khrushchev that the latter called off because of the U-2 flight. HM: "Well, I think that all our experts here very much overestimated Khrushchev's power. Because Stalin had been a ruthless dictator for twenty years, they assumed that his successor was a successor to a dynasty as strong. But he wasn't for two reasons. First of all, he wasn't as strong as Stalin--hadn't the extraordinary, almost maniac grip that that man had. And secondly, the one thing Russia was never going to have again was the terror. If you're a dictator and you won't have the terror, you are getting very near almost to a free system." And on to civil disobedience among the trade unions, the Special Relationship, and what had changed between 1942, when Churchill said that he had not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire, and what Mr. Macmillan calls "the India decision" in 1947.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

There he speaks and takes questions from hecklers week after week, year after year, decade after decade. Unfortunately," Mr. Buckley continues, he is "a socialist and a pacifist and, unfortunately, he confuses Christian doctrine with these secular heresies." Nonetheless, this proves to be a good-natured exchange, whether on Christian doctrine or on the position of blacks in the American South or on Karl Marx's dialectics or on the Inquisition. DS: "What I would say is this. I would prefer to try to resist Communism, even were we invaded by Communist hordes, by non-violent methods, than to precipitate a war in order to resist that Communist threat. I honestly believe that there is nothing worse than war." WFB: "You believe that there's nothing worse than war."

Today's discussion is often technical, on matters such as excess dollars held by foreign governments, floating versus fixed exchange rates, and Common Market farming policies, but it is good to meet the future President of the republic, in company with the future U.S. Ambassador to France. VGdE: "Flotation is probably a means to be used before an adjustment of parities. If you want to know how the market would judge your own currency, it could be useful to let it float, for instance, several weeks or a few months, but not as an institution."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But already the question was, "How would the next presidential campaign be financed? A new law was passed a year ago ...," WFB begins, "but the law is itself the subject of criticism as a bureaucratic nightmare and as a measure of quite dubious constitutionality." A lively discussion of both the theory and the recent history of campaign finance, with Mr. Strauss floating an idea that nearly thirty years later began to find favor with people on both sides of the fence: "One of the great weaknesses we've had, one of the great faults we've had, one of the things that's made people think it's sinister or evil, has been secrecy. And I think bringing it out in the open and opening the doors and windows and letting people see who's giving and to whom they are giving begins to get at the heart of the problem."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The discussion starts with Vietnam and the alienation of the intellectuals, but roves widely in time and space. EVR: "What's happened, I think, psychologically is that the policies and ideas which dominated the postwar period ... have suddenly lost their power to command." WFB: "Why?" EVR: "... Well, I think men have reached the conclusion that if that policy requires results as terrible as Korea and Vietnam, there must be something wrong with it. There must be an easier way to achieve security." ... EVR: "The line I always took when I did talk about [Vietnam]... was when you use force, you'd better win. ..." WWR: "My own view, from 1961 down to the time I left Washington, was that there's only one military way to shorten the war .. . you had to put forces on the ground across the Ho Chi Minh Trail or into the southern part of North Vietnam ... The President did not accept that position, and I believe for good reasons, ... [but] that led to its being an extremely protracted war....

Mr. Carter was the leader of the challenger (i.e., anti-Wallace) Mississippi delegation at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Mr. Reed, one of the first Republican activists in the Deep South, was a conservative leader at the 1972 Republican Convention in Miami. But today's subject is not partisan politics but rather the civil-rights laws. Would desegregation have come about anyway, owing to as WFB puts it, "a developed conscience," or did it require, in Mr. Carter's phrase, the "extremely heroic effort" of Martin Luther King and others? To Mr. Reed, "I was concerned at the time that the overriding concern of protecting the Constitution and the three-part government transcended the immediate gains of civil rights in the South.... I disagree with Hodding. I think this would have come about, but this saved a great many years. Now whether it saved enough years to tamper with the fabric of constitutional law-that's an open question."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Is it distinctive still? This show starts a little slowly--Miss Welty in particular is thoughtful rather than quick--but we soon get to the heart of the matter. WP: "I think that for a hundred years Southern literature, before and after the Civil War, was not particularly distinguished. It was ingrown; it was either romantic or it was defensive.... Then along about 1920, I think the cultures began to merge and you had a kind of spark jumping, so that you had people like Faulkner coming on who began to write about their region but in such universal terms, neither romantically nor defensively, that it made itself understood to people from other parts of the country." ... EW: "I was here all that time and I felt the unreality of late-night telephone calls from strangers asking me, 'How can you stay in that place? Why don't you use all of your novelistic powers and so on and write some things against this?' And really, I assumed that my whole life I had been writing about injustice ... I was always against it, but what I was writing about was human beings."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample from Mr. Burgess: "What have I, a person of a very ancient generation, a person who's already 55, to say to young men and women in their late teens and twenties? I think I have something to say, but this is contested, and not only by the young. It's contested also by people who should know better-the professors, the lecturers who put themselves beside the young deliberately, hoping thereby when the revolution comes, if it does come, that they'll get some sort of special preference, discounting the fact that they'll probably be the first to be put up against the wall and have to face the firing squad."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

California voters had just rejected a ballot initiative to ease the marijuana laws; but many organizations had come to favor changes ranging from outright legalization to decriminalization of possession. Are changes in public attitudes prompted by new research? Not really, according to Dr. Bryant: "We have a number of ongoing research projects, trying to get at the physiological, biochemical, psychological changes," but "I'm not sure that there have been any major breakthroughs." Nonetheless, he has come to favor decriminalization. Mr. Greenway, whose specialty is being a curmudgeon, spends several minutes fencing ("I don't care for sincerity, either"), but then settles down to recounting experiences both as a professor and as a member of the Boulder Police Department: "What makes marijuana, to me, particularly dangerous is that it's represented as not being dangerous."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

He is most often referred to nowadays as a radical." He once studied for the priesthood at a Jesuit seminary; his latest book raked his church over the coals. The sharp exchanges here between two old friends and former comrades in arms are clearly illustrative of two different worldviews. GW: "Up until recently ... there were certain ... loyalty tests-if you didn't eat meat on Friday, if you didn't practice birth control... These were the matters of authority; this is what made you a Catholic.... Obviously [the Pope] feels ... that if people can disobey him on [birth control], they are going to say then, 'The Pope doesn't matter' ..." WFB: "No, but only if they defy him explicitly. It's one thing for a bishop to say, 'I will not enjoin on my flock conformity to Humanae vitae'; it's something else for women to use birth-control devices surreptitiously...." GW: "Well, the way that they do defy him explicitly is a very interesting one and very important to the Catholic psychology; that is, the ones who practice birth control now still go to the Sacraments. There could not be in the Catholic mentality a more total denial of the Pope's power to refuse the Sacraments to them."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Lazo was not directly involved in that operation, but, as he tells us, "a year after Castro came to power, in January 1960, when the American embassy went down, I became a self-appointed spy for the U.S.... And what I did was to arrange with a friendly European government to send reports once a week to the FBI." ... EHH: "The fiasco of the Bay of Pigs was not a failure of intelligence.... The failure of the Bay of Pigs came about because at a critical time commitments that had been made by high officials of the United States government to the Cubans who were fighting,... those officials backed away from those commitments and, in effect, abandoned the brigade at the beachhead." Discursive at times but fascinating, not least Mr. Lazo's reminiscences of events in Cuba ten and twenty years earlier that are linked to Watergate.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

I've had the experience of being in government and out, and trying to make that distinction is not always easy, but it's certainly a distinguishable condition.

The slogan 'Free Huey Newton' was to the late Sixties what the slogan 'Who promoted Peress?" was to the early Fifties." In due course an appeals court reversed the verdict, and the juries thereafter were hung, so that Mr. Newton eventually was freed. This show has many surprises, starting with the first exchange. WFB: "... imminently he will publish his autobiography, which is called Revolutionary Suicide, a concept I shall now ask Mr. Newton, please, to explain." HN: "I'll explain it, but if I may impose upon you, I have a friend who's almost dying for me to ask this question, if you will. The question is: During the Revolution of 1776, when the United States of America broke away from England, my friend would like to know which side would you have been on during that time?" WFB: "I think probably I would have been on the side of George Washington. I'm not absolutely sure, because it remains to be established historically whether what we sought to prove at that point might not have been proved by more peaceful means.

It turns out that there really isn't a standard--not one, at any rate, that Mr. Whitehead or Mr. Buckley can come up with--that doesn't have an element of subjectivity. But along the way we learn a lot about how the FCC actually interprets the Fairness Doctrine, how the new technologies make it easier to infringe on copyrights, and whether reruns are in the public interest. WFB: "Just what does 'elitist gossip' mean?" CTW: "It, in my book, means just what it says. It's the trading of more or less unsubstantiated tales among people who think that they're a little better than other people.... For instance, the network reporter who comes on the air and says, without doing much checking of his own, that, 'It is being said in Washington that,' or 'It is widely believed that.'"</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

There is, of course, the matter of the hugeness of Texas; but there is also the tradition of Texas-rich, powerful, self-assured, demanding, cocky, impenitent." Mrs. Farenthold is a Democrat who has fought the Democratic establishment on the grounds of its corruption ("We don't have clean-cut bribery any more. It's all with stock manipulation or sale of ranch lands at inflated prices or disposition of oil leases")-although she is evidently shocked when Mr. Buckley asks whether "the Federal Government ought to intervene in Texan affairs in order to set things right." To Mrs. Milburn, the problem is that Texas has "a one-party monopoly and it breeds corruption ... You may change some of the players but the plays remain the same." Mr. Dugger admits that "I would prefer an honest Republican to a dishonest Democrat"-but instantly carries the fight back into the enemy's camp over the way Texas primaries are run. A hard-fought, entertaining hour in this larger-than-life state.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

This rich discussion-which ranges from present-day Bulgaria to early Christianity to Confucianism to Daniel Ellsberg-begins with Mr. Buckley asking Mr. Shakespeare "why he irritated foreigners. What have you got against foreigners?" FS: "... I would say to the extent that we irritated foreigners you'd have to divide the world into groups of people. I think we were an irritant to the Soviet Union, certainly." On to an explanation of how the Voice of America operates, and how to deal with dictatorships: "I think as dictatorships get terribly insecure they frequently try to resolve their internal insecurities by creating, artificially, an external peril. But if you follow that line of thinking too far you'll say, 'Well we should do everything in the world to make that dictatorship secure.'

That was that in 1966 it happened to be the 50th anniversary of what the British call the Dublin Rebellion and what the Irish call the Rising ... This gave [extreme Protestant Ian] Paisley his platform of protest... and from that moment on, things became very, very difficult"). The discussion ranges back to Cromwell and forward to the likely outcome of the current situation, in which Britain had suspended Stormont (Northern Ireland's parliament) and imposed direct rule from London. There is a fascinating and moving detour on World War II-the part that Northern Ireland played in the Allies' effort, and the difference it might have made had the Irish Republic done the same.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

A spirited give-and-take ranging from nationalized health care to taxation to old-age pensions. WFB: "Your commitment to socialism is a very considerable commitment; so is your commitment to democracy. What I'm asking you is this: As a Christian, if you have to forsake one or the other, which of the two do you forsake?" SW: "What politicians tend to say is, 'I don't answer hypothetical questions.' I will answer it.... Well, I would forsake socialism for democracy ... because-" WFB: "Now, why?" SW: "... What is central to my philosophy, I suppose, is a dispersal, a sharing of power.... I don't want a government which is so powerful, like that of the Soviet Union, that in effect it can order the way in which people live ... So I may want something that you would argue is impossible of achievement, that is to say, the maximum individual liberty but in a situation in which power is distributed as widely as can be."

On the one hand, critics such as Mr. Newell, himself a "public school old boy," were campaigning to end the practice in England. On the other hand, some Americans, as Mr. Buckley relates, wonder if reinstituting corporal punishment in our country mightn't help solve some of our schools' worst disciplinary problems. Mr. Kuper, who vigorously defends the practice in England but thinks it would be "catastrophic" to export it to the States, is wonderfully old-school. A delicious cultural clash--with the student panelists (all very grown-up sounding, but wearing the Beatle haircuts of the period) speaking not of world events but of what they know first hand.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

I mean, everybody exploits what they have.... I might as well say that if you weren't such a good-looking fellow, you wouldn't be in the position that you're in today. You exploit it too.

The rescission had been mobilized, as WFB puts it, "not by sexist males but by women, many of whom on second blush are discovering in the amendment implications they regard as inimical to the best interests of American women." Like what? Like, replies Mrs. Schlafly, the draft. Wait a minute, says Ms. Scott: "if women are to be citizens and citizens are to be subject to the draft, then women should take the responsibilities as well as the rights of citizenship."

The Governor, who was the immediate successor to the segregationist Lester Maddox, had struck out on a dramatically new course by saying, in his inaugural address, "I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over." Since then he had argued, as WFB puts it, "that Southern governors nowadays face other problems, much the same as those faced by governors of states outside the South." In this encounter, Governor Carter sounds quite conservative in talking about welfare and incentives, and specifically the advantages in having job-training programs and attendant industry dispersed throughout the state so that "instead of moving to Atlanta and living in a 20-story-high apartment complex," poor farmers can commute to a local job that pays a living wage; hence "we haven't had the massive move off the farm areas into the cities that other states have."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Twelve hundred Firing Lines later ... But back to Senator Hollings, who is scathing on the way the quasi-privatization of the Post Office had been done. The spirited conversation ranges from permitting real competition in postal services, to the effect of poor postal service on the magazine industry, to Senator Hollings's other preoccupation, welfare reform. EFH: "Now here in America, if you try to feed little children like that, there are many in my own crowd who say, 'Oh, no, if you feed them, they'll never work'; whereas one of the great planks of America's national defense, in international relations or foreign policy, is to feed.

WFB and his guests mostly remand the details of what happened at the Watergate and who ordered it to a time when more evidence is in; instead, the crackling discussion ranges from the possibility of changing the presidential tenure to a single, six-year term, to how Congresses have historically dealt with a President who has been repudiated but is still in office (e.g., Herbert Hoover in 1931), to the continuing war in Vietnam. WFB: "If you live in a society in which lawlessness becomes intellectually fashionable, as it was in this country during the last ten years, you beget, I think, a counter-countercultural lawlessness of which Watergate is an example."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The Nixon Administration and Congress had been clashing regularly for four years by now--whether over Mr. Nixon's authority to order the Cambodian incursion, or, now, over executive privilege and the growing shadow of Watergate. The Senator is honest enough to admit that the growth of presidential power by no means began with the man who defeated him for the Presidency. Mr. Humphrey starts with FDR and goes on from there, with some of the more flavorous descriptions being of the man he served as Vice President: "Your lapels were never safe with Lyndon Johnson, you know.... Johnson was a total political man. I don't think that Mr. Nixon is at all. Nixon is, in many ways, a loner. That's his style."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

In Mr. Rusher's view, not much: "I don't think that either liberal Republicans or conservative Republicans, as such, have been touched in any important particular by Watergate. It is the group in the White House which is neither liberal nor conservative but administrative, non-political, the Haldeman-Ehrlichman group, that has been totally destroyed by Watergate." To Mr. van den Haag, Nixon "is seen, not necessarily by the conservatives themselves but by the non-conservatives, including those sympathetic to conservatism and those not so sympathetic, as the symbol of how conservative the Republican Party can get and win. No doubt Mr. Goldwater is seen as more conservative, but not as winning." And on to civil disobedience, the ethics of bugging, and whether the break-in at Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was really motivated by concern for national security.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Since then, the Supreme Court had dropped its Roe v. Wade bombshell, to the surprise, as WFB points out, of pro-lifers and pro-choicers alike. In this well-argued and often heated discussion, Mrs. Pilpel, who considers Roe a "superb decision," takes seriously that decision's language concerning the different trimesters of pregnancy. Mr. Noonan proves the more prescient in saying, "In fact, throughout the entire nine months, there is [in Roe] no recognition of the baby's interest and life, and we do in fact have, for the first time in our history, for the first time in the history of Anglo-American civilization, abortion on demand as the law of the land."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

How can we conveniently distinguish between, for instance, my habit, firmly consolidated, of requiring peanut butter for breakfast and somebody else's habit of requiring a heroin shot at breakfast time?" TS: "Why should we?" WFB: "I want you to help me terminologically because I think that unless your prisms are acute enough to distinguish between peanut butter for breakfast and heroin for breakfast, you may very well be being frivolous in a dangerous sense."

He and Mr. Buckley strike sparks off each other in addressing such questions as, how can government best encourage citizens not to pollute? Is government itself encouraging pollution and waste of depletable resources by, e.g., favoring highways over railroads? Do Cadillac buyers not know, or do they not care, that their vehicles use more gasoline than Volkswagens?

Not yet, he says, given what else we might do with finite resources, and given how much of the data brought back we still have not assimilated. This is not the most exciting show, but Admiral Shepard has thought deeply and speaks engagingly on matters such as what, apart from the human spirit, space exploration is good for. AS: "I think that the recent Skylab mission, which was supposed to be 28 days of blissful experiments and turned out to be 28 days of a cliffhanger, probably demonstrated as graphically as any of us could how well man can function in space--not only the crew but those men on the Earth who are responding to the various emergencies that come up."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The dominant condition of life in that unit is anarchy. Anarchy has never lasted very long in any unit....

The Simeses were among the few who had been allowed to leave the Soviet Union, and they had been living here for nearly a year. Their English is not perfect, but that ceases to matter as they describe life in Stalin's day, compared to the Khrushchev reform period, compared to the current middle-Brezhnev period. DS: "Well, in 1953, you could be an average man. You had nothing against the government. You could enjoy Soviet life and the Soviet regime, and, nevertheless, one day your neighbor in your apartment could decide that he needs your room.

One sample: LH: "Mr. Buckley, you know,you surprise me because you are espousing sort of 19th-century ideals." DW: "I think he surprises even himself." WFB: "I'm not embarrassed by the 19th century.

Here, discussing comparative British and American scandals (while Watergate was still less than half over, a British sex scandal had been dispatched in weeks), he is less predictable, and all the more interesting. E.g., on why a Watergate-type scandal would have played out very differently in Britain: "Well, I believe that a prime minister who was under the kind of attack that Nixon has been under certainly wouldn't have been able to avoid coming and facing his accusers. He would have had to come there at least every Tuesday and every Thursday whilst the British House of Commons was sitting and, indeed, of course, he would have faced serious risk of a vote of censure."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

HS: "I don't think that that is a basic human right." WFB: "Why not?" HS: "Because I believe the principles of democracy are that the minority will obey the will of the majority."

WFB: "It is widely assumed that there was a terrible collapse of English statecraft before the First World War and before the Second World War. Was there the equivalent gloating in America that you know of?" MM: "I wouldn't have said in America so much, but certainly on the Continent, and in my lifetime I've seen this attitude. When I was young, the Empire was at its maximum strength and I felt this incredible hatred that everybody had for the British.

Mr. Adelman believes we can and argues that the worst thing we could do would be to panic in the face of Faisal's threat. Mr. Ritchie argues that at least at present--"owing partly to economic factors, partly to environmentalist pressure, and partly to a lack of confidence that there will be crude oil to produce"--we are dangerously short on production and refinement facilities. A lucid discussion that helps clarify the issues for the layman--although we may find disquieting the degree to which the experts disagree--on, e.g., the amount of gas or oil or uranium left in the earth: MA: "Jock, I really cannot remain silent.

However, many observers felt that he had not demanded enough in the way of concrete actions. Was Sir Alec being overly cautious, or was he being realistic? "You've got to be practical here. The Russians just won't take it [the Iron Curtain] down, and, therefore, you have got to find ways and means of contact with Russia which are modest,... but never the less are a plus in terms of international relations and detente."

Our guest quickly turns the tables on his host, saying: "I think we'll get a clearer picture if we just push aside Mr. Nixon and concentrate on yourself, because you are the spokesman for conservatism--" ("A spokesman," WFB corrects), and Mr. Lubell wonders if "there's any basis for conservatism left in the light of [Nixon's] performance."

The series lives up to its billing, starting with this session featuring the leader of the behaviorist school of psychology and a leader in cognitive theory. Do people develop the attitudes they do because, as Mr. Skinner puts it, "when we behave in selfish ways, we get slapped down"?

"Explosive," because of its implications for social policy. Mr. Herrnstein had stirred up a ruckus with his book IQ in the Meritocracy (though nothing like the ruckus he and Charles Murray would stir up twenty years later with The Bell Curve--see Firing Lines s1029 and s1030), and he and Mr. Bever are old antagonists. But they remain civil enough to give us a clear idea of the points at issue between those who believe there is an element of heritability and those who believe IQ is purely a matter of social conditioning. RH: "It's not unclear at all. When you give a group of children--or adults, for that matter--an IQ test, you get a group of numbers. The numbers don't know where they came from, and these numbers can be subjected to a statistical procedure known as estimative heritability ... The answer comes out that the variation in IQ scores from individual to individual is something between 60 and 90 percent heritable. You don't need a theory of intelligence to say that."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Mr. Ruckelshaus whether he believes there is any question about Mr. Nixon's right to fire Mr. Cox." WR: "I think there's some question about his right to fire him. There is no question about his power to do so." WFB: "Would you elaborate on the distinction?" WR: "Yes. I think 'right' implies some correctness of action, which I thought was questionable, and that was why I refused to execute the order. I think that acting through a presidential appointee [such as the] attorney general, he would unquestionably ultimately have the power to do so."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

HJM: "We have a very unfortunate tendency to go from one extreme to the other.

Mr. Martin has the gift of the blarney, but he contradicts himself regularly and has trouble addressing the central question Mr. Buckley raises--concerning the assertion in Mr. Martin's book that, as Mr. Buckley paraphrases it, "the disrepute of Christianity is significantly related to the tendency of diverse cultures and civilizations to take Jesus and adapt him to their own uses and paradigms." One sample from Mr. Martin: "I think we have millions of much better people than ever today and there is born a new thing in the hearts of people. There is, I think, under the pressure of life today and the intercommunication and the action of Jesus, who works with compassion--I do sound like a Bible preacher but really I believe this--there is born a new interest in the self, in what I am."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Nixon. This time around,the guest is the man who resigned from President Nixon's Administration rather than fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox (Firing Line s0114). We begin cautiously: WFB: "Are you free to discuss those of Mr. Nixon's characteristics that affect his Administration, either adversely or favorably?" ER: "Yes." WFB: "Beginning with the latter, let's say." ER; "Well, suppose we get a little more specific; we'd find out just how free I was. I think that insofar as I can shed any light on how we've come to where we are and what this may mean for the future, I'd like to try to do that." And so he does, citing, for example, an unrelated case in which the special prosecutor had asked for certain documents. "We had obviously read the documents; they were in our hands. And there was nothing in them that was incriminating, and yet I was instructed by the White House not to make them available to the special prosecutor as well as to stand on executive privilege in the civil action."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The committee has yet to write its report, but it is generally agreed that it will not succeed again in comparing itself and its purposes to the rising sun or the Milky Way. Patrick Buchanan put an end to that." On this show he is a combative and energetic defender of his Chief, occasionally straying away from John Dean, Judge Sirica, and the tapes to talk about, e.g., the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and Harry Truman's drop in popularity during the Korean War. PJB: "In my judgment the President was fully justified if, in fact, it is true that during 1969 and 1970 he secretly bombed the occupied sectors of Cambodia because American troops were on the other side of the frontier. I think he was justified even--which I don't know to be true--if there was a necessary falsification of certain papers at the Pentagon ... in order that Prince Sihanouk could make certain statements with regard to what Americans were doing in Cambodia. To me that would be as justified as the fact that Dwight Eisenhower and others obviously put out lies and false stories about what American troops were going to do prior to Normandy."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

From the perspective of many viewers, however, she muddies her point by her overarching critique of Western institutions of power: "All right, we've got the Rice Krispie man [a hypothetical fraudulent advertiser], who is really a rather minor criminal compared, in my view at least, to the manufacturer of napalm and other genocidal weapons or to the policemen who routinely commit crimes on the beat."

He is, however, unbowed: "Well, legitimate historians are always in the process of revising history, whether it's based upon new archaeological finds or some documents of the 19th century that crop up. But I don't believe that we should roll over and play dead just because someone writes a political tract and calls it history." A rich discussion starting with the beginnings of the Cold War, moving to the early days of the Kennedy Administration--when Cuba and Berlin and, soon, Vietnam were all clamoring for attention--and on to the American campus of today.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: WFB: "If you deny the philanthropic impulses of the American people, you are being anti-historical." KC: "I'd deny them." WFB: "Well, how do you account for $150 billion [a year in private philanthropy]?" KC: "Tax breaks." WFB: "I don't know where you went to school, but there were only three million people who paid income taxes in the Thirties, and yet practically every private institution, every church, every hospital was built. It was built by Americans. You all of a sudden think that charity was invented by FDR or something?"

The results on both counts were, as WFB relates them, pretty depressing. The bulk of the hour is spent--sometimes heatedly--analyzing the poll and debating how close it comes to reality. WFB: "But I am asking about the causes of alienation, and both you and I agree that there is alienation, isn't there?" EM: "Well, it seems to me that since you and I are accepting the poll's measure of whether or not there is alienation, we ought to be interested in how the poll arrived at that conclusion." WFB: "That's a technical question." EM: "That is not technical. It's very substantive."

Mr. Heath had called an election--an election that he would lose, setting the stage for Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy. This show offers a spirited and wide-ranging discussion, exploring the differences between American and British law on strikes in essential industries, the differences in the two countries' electoral systems, and the causes of inflation. WFB: "[What about] the rather unexpected move of Enoch Powell. How do you interpret his decision not to run again?" (See Firing Line s0127.) BL: "I think Tony ought to speak first on that one because he's an old--" WFB: "Powell watcher?" BL: "...Powellite from top to bottom, and I'm not." AL: "I'm not a Powellite from top to bottom." BL: "From side to side, then." AL: "I'm a Powellite from side to side, yes. Two things only I'd say about it. One, I think that Powell could not have run on a Heath election platform.

(In the event, Labour's margin of victory was so narrow that a new election was called in October of that year; Mr. Powell run for election from Northern Ireland on the Unionist Party ticket and won.) The conversation focuses specifically on wage and price controls, more generally on inflation and the march of socialism; and on subjects such as these the eccentric Mr. Powell seems not at all eccentric: "The politician should never say that a trend is inevitable. It's his business to see to it that a trend, if he doesn't agree with it, is not inevitable. But I would be prepared to admit that if you wanted to make a case for the inevitability of a trend towards socialism, a very strong point that you could take up would be the fact that a Conservative government which came in in 1970 with a radical market philosophy ... within two years was introducing legislation which not merely re-echoed the legislation of the socialist party but exceeded their delighted dreams."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

So what you insist on calling tax subsidies, tax expenditures, I would simply view as a form of remission...." SS: "I don't agree ...with the way you characterized my general position ... I would put it this way. We have decided to have an income tax in this country.... The base of the tax, the thing we're going to tax, is an individual's income." WFB: "Yes."

JL: "In Dallas County, Alabama, in 1965, for example, only 2.1 per cent of the black people of voting age were registered to vote. Today more than 67 per cent... are registered to vote. They have paved streets, they have a sewer system.... In Greene County, Alabama, in 1965,...less than 300 black people were registered to vote. Today black people control the county. They are working with white people and they're working together. You have a housing authority there. For the first time in the history of that county black people have decent housing." And Mr. Bond tells how he learned something about the tendency among politicians, black or white, to "overpromise": "My notion of the $2 minimum wage, for example, vanished rather quickly when I found myself in the legislature and saw what the temperament of the body was."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

In reply to Mr. Buckley's question--"Now, if something can last between 1921 and 1968, why can't it last out the balance of the century?"--Mr. Hume gives a masterly account of the threads that came together in the late Sixties to produce the violence that led, in 1972, to Britain's suspending Stormont and assuming direct rule of Northern Ireland. Britain had recently restored a measure of home rule; one of the conditions was that the Catholic minority had to be represented in the executive branch, which was why the Catholic Mr. Hume had been named Minister of Commerce. JH: "Well, the fear is consistently expressed by the Protestant majority in the North, which is a Protestant minority in Ireland, that... by coming into a united country they would be subjected to what they call 'Rome rule.' That fear is consistently expressed. I don't personally believe that if all of the changes they ask for took place tomorrow that would advance their wish for Irish unity one iota."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

JV: "No. I can definitely say that it wasn't a question of being pro-Nazi. I was anti-British...." WFB: "So that in fact to deduce from that that you were pro-Nazi would be as incorrect as to deduce that we were pro-Communist because we were on the side of Stalin." JV: "Quite.... I was pro-Afrikaans." Then onto the present, with the Prime Minister impressively discussing his country's policies on press freedom, comparative standards of living in different parts of Africa, and whether you can have a successful multi-racial society. JV: "I take it what you do mean in fact--maybe you were too polite to say it--is that it is said we are in fact a police state." WFB:"It's certainly said. Certainly, yes."

Mr. Buckley begins by reminding us that "in 1965 Rhodesia had requested independence of Great Britain, and Britain had said no, on the grounds that Mr. Smith's government represented only 5 per cent of the population. Whereupon at 11:15 A.M. on November 11, 1965, the government issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence, the UDI, the second such declaration by a former colony in Britain's history--the first being our very own, which was signed before the word 'unilateral' was invented." As of this taping, Rhodesia remained a pariah nation, beleaguered by external sanctions and internal terrorism. An informative discussion of the history of colonialism in Africa, the current state of Rhodesia's economy, and the scene in nearby countries such as Mozambique and Zambia. One sample, on the subject of introducing democracy: IS: "The American people basically have always lived under this system. Now, we're dealing with people who say, 'But we don't understand this thing that the white man has brought here. We live under the tribal system. We're quite happy, we're peaceful. Why don't you leave us alone?' What do you say to them? 'You can't be left alone and peaceful. Whether you like it or not, you must come in and play a part with us'? It's not an easy question."

His current task was to help as many Republicans as possible get elected to Congress six months thence (though, to be sure, no one was likely to hold him responsible for the eventual failure). It was an ominous sign that Republican candidates had just lost four of five by-elections. WFB: "There has, of course, been a lot of talk about Mr. Nixon as an albatross. Is it your judgment that if Mr. Nixon were to decide tonight that he wanted to become a poet or whatever, and eliminate himself without any sort of residual stigma, under such circumstances as those would you project that the party would have an easier time in November?" GB: "You are not going to like this answer because I know of your intellectual alacrity, but I am not going to get into these hypotheses because this is not going to happen. I know and respect the views of the very distinguished Senator from New York named Buckley ... My view is it is wrong for the President to resign, it is wrong for him to be forced out of office; the system has got to work, the system will work in fairness...." WFB: "You say it's like saying, 'What if the Pope became a Seventh-Day Adventist?'" GB: "Well, something like that. I wish I had thought of that, but, yes, I don't think it's in the makeup of the man."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

" In Mr. Hunt's previous Firing Line appearance (s0077) the subject was the CIA and the Bay of Pigs; here he and his host explore the similarities and differences between official acts of clandestine agents and unofficial operations like the Plumbers'. Specifically, Mr. Hunt explains that the financial arrangement he had demanded was simply the clandestine services' traditional way of taking care of the families of captured agents. WFB: "I'm wondering what it is that caused [Nixon and his men] to use that term [blackmail], considering that you were saying this was really a traditional arrangement." EHH: "Well, I certainly understood it traditionally; obviously others did not, who should have."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

And there was "a vague sensation of movement: the Suez Canal is being reopened, the cease fire on the Egyptian front is months old." However, some observers believe that "nothing will happen until disposition is made of the demands of the Palestinian refugees," and Mr. Sayegh is of that camp. He might not convince any Israelis, but he makes his case in masterly fashion, working from UN Resolution 242, which sought to guarantee Israel's independence, back through the UN action of 1947 in establishing a " 'Jewish state'[which] made provisions for the protection of the Arabs who were to continue to live [there]," further back to the Balfour declaration, which "did not speak of a 'Jewish state'; it spoke of a 'national home,' " and back further still, to the centuries when, "Until Zionism came, it was perfectly normal for Jews and Arabs to live together in our part of the world.

Aspin had been, as WFB reminds us, "one of Secretary McNamara's whiz kids in the Pentagon" (he would later himself briefly serve as Secretary of Defense under President Clinton), and he was now one of the Pentagon's sharpest critics. Host and guest agree that, as Rep Aspin puts it, "we should be buying the kind of weapons to counter the Soviet capabilities, not... just go ahead blindly and buy ships." Where the disagreement comes in--with lots of supporting detail on both sides--is over just how you tell what those needed weapons are. WFB: "Theoretically, if there were 200 million Russians and we had 200 million bullets, that would be all we would need if we could aim each bullet at each Russian." In the course of the hour we look at ships and planes and subs and cruise missiles and ICBMs, and Mr. Aspin's assertion, concerning the Soviet army, "Well, that's a very big army, but really half of it ... is on the Chinese border to prevent them waking up one morning and finding that the Chinese have chomped off a bit of territory."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

A rich discussion of how the Presidency reached its present state--which is, host and guest agree, too strong in some respects and too weak in others--enlivened by the off beat perspective that makes Mr. McCarthy arguably a better poet than he would have been a President: e.g., his proposal that instead of picking the President first and letting him pick his running mate, the "big fights at conventions ought to be over who's going to be the Vice President.... You pick the Vice President and you let him pick the presidential candidate. And you see all the good that would come out of that. You'd be picking a man who would say, 'I have no ambition at this point to be President. I'm going to take the least of all political jobs ... I will demonstrate my humility.

"One suggested remedy," as Mr. Buckley frames the question, "is a drastic new look at the Fifth Amendment and its interpretation by the Supreme Court, and here to say, 'Leave it alone,' is Edward Bennett Williams," whose clients had included Jimmy Hoffa and Frank Costello. A brilliant duel that takes the question far beyond the Warren Court--back to the beginnings of Anglo-American jurisprudence, and before that to the medieval Church and to the Talmud. "I think that in a free society it is essentially unfair and essentially unfree to confront one suspected of a crime with conviction if he confesses his guilt, perjury if he denies it, or contempt if he refuses to answer it. It seems to me it is essentially like saying to a small child who is suspected of taking your loose change ...

On this occasion, Mr. Buckley attempts to engage the Vice President on the question whether President Nixon shouldn't take into account the position of Republican congressmen facing re-election in deciding how to respond if a bill of impeachment should be brought. Unfortunately for the quality of the discussion, Mr. Ford's loyalty, or prudence, prevents him from even considering such a hypothetical involving his Chief. The closest he will come to answering is to say: "I don't think there is sufficient evidence to contend as an impeachable offense that the President was involved in the alleged cover-up, or in the cover-up."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The most famous was probably that of Patty Hearst; but Reg Murphy's, as WFB puts it, "gives us the rare opportunity to have the insights of someone who was himself kidnapped who is trained to observe as a journalist observes." A fascinating exploration, starting with the issue of whether acceding to a ransom demand is "anti-social" or "absolutely essential." RM: "The kidnapper operates in an area of paranoia, of extreme tension ... under more tension even than the victim is, because he has to make everything work right, in the first place.

(In fact, the "smoking gun" tape wasn't released until four weeks after today’s discussion.) Messrs. Woodward and Bernstein are candid -- as they were in their book--in admitting that they pressed the ethical limits of journalistic investigation. WFB then raises a question of presidential ethics, in Richard Nixon's having (a) taped his conversations and then (b) not immediately destroyed the tapes once the investigation began: "I think that private conversations are awesomely private and ought to be; besides, unless it's a soliloquy, you're involving somebody else, and to exercise dominion over somebody else's conversation and disclose it I simply find heinous."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Like, say, Arthur Jensen and Richard Herrnstein, Mr. Shockley was widely reviled for talking about the heritability of certain traits. Unlike them, he was promoting something that, post-Hitler, had become, as WFB puts it, "unspeakable." Mr. Shockley was suggesting a "voluntary sterilization bonus plan": "the amount of the bonus would be dependent on various factors. For example, income-tax payers would be offered no bonus. For all others, regardless of sex, race, or welfare status, ... the bonus would depend upon best scientific estimates - and that's a very important qualifying phrase ... -of any genetically carried disabilities, such as arthritis, hemophilia, Huntington's chorea. And if there is a genetic predisposal to heroin addiction, this should get a big bonus. Then I go on to say, furthermore, add $1,000 for every point you score below 100 on an IQ test."

Was this because of Watergate, "or because the Russians are Communists, or a combination of the two?" A combination, Mr. Nitze explains ("...one of the things they take into account is what they call the correlation of forces. And I think they do, in looking at the correlation of forces, estimate what the internal political strength of the United States is, and I think it is without doubt that the Watergate affair has weakened the Presidency and therefore has made it more difficult for us to achieve the kind of agreements which we really should have"), and we are launched on a thorough discussion of strategic arms and general military preparedness.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Three proposals were on the table, and "the bones of contention," as WFB phrases it, "seem to be (1) how much, if anything, should be deductible, (2) is there a role for the private insurance companies, and (3) how best to disguise from the people the fact that they are paying the bills." To Mr. Fine, "We need... the principle of health care as a right." To Dr. Roth, "actually more people are receiving more and better medical care in more and better-equipped facilities from more and better-trained physicians than ever before in history, and that really doesn't sound like crisis. The only crisis is in the cost area ..." A sometimes heated, always informative discussion.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The next day a white guard was found dead, and George Jackson and two other inmates--who became known as the Soledad Brothers--were indicted for his murder. Angela Davis, a young, black, Communist professor of philosophy at UCLA, became the spearhead of the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee. She did not, however, confine her efforts to speechmaking and fundraising: she also bought several guns which were later used by George Jackson's brother, Jonathan, in a hostage-taking attempt at the Marin County Courthouse that left the younger Jackson and three others dead. The following year George Jackson himself--who by that time had been transferred to the maximum-security San Quentin--was killed while attempting a jailbreak. Today's often heated exchange--with a champion of George Jackson (GA: "George ... was a man who had a tremendous ability to care about people. He took upon himself to be, in a sense, the conscience of the black race") and the prosecutor of another of Mr. Jackson's champions--gives us a window on that time when "revolutionary" was a prized designation.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

One sample: HK: "It seems not to be remembered Paradise Lost was written by a man who might well have been under a death sentence if Andrew Marvell had not intervened and asked him to just be quiet, partly because he was blind. And Paradise Lost is very largely apolitical tract in which Satan coming back to disrupt the harmony of the new creation is marvelously plausible and attractive because he is modeled on Charles II, who had just done the same thing and whose point of entrance to the British psyche was notoriously by way of woman."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Questions had been raised in the American press and in Congress as to whether the CIA had had a hand in "destabilizing" the Allende regime. In the highly charged post-Watergate atmosphere, there was talk of bringing action against various officials, including Ambassador Korry. On this show, Mr. Korry is not at liberty to say everything he knows, but we still get some fascinating stories and serious analysis. WFB: "So therefore you tilted in the direction of helping them [the Allende government]." EK: "I didn't tilt. I walked in to their foreign minister, who described himself in that period as an all-out Maoist--and this was in the period of the Red Guards-- ... and I said, 'You know my view of what I think Dr. Allende and you represent in the way of political forces ... You know that I was opposed to you; but you are now the representative of a sovereign power, and I am a representative of a sovereign power, and we are both mature individuals.'..."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

We'll probably never know whom he didn't want to discuss (Enoch Powell? Harold Wilson? Margaret Thatcher?), but there is plenty else to talk about, especially the Heath government's relations with the unions and whether, as Mr. Buckley quotes an unnamed British politician as charging, "Britain has become a syndicalist despotism." No, says Mr. Heath emphatically, it has not: "We had our position, the trade unions had theirs, the employers had theirs, and we said, 'There have got to be compromises.' We made ours and over a large field the employers and the trade unions made theirs." There's a fascinating discursion on why Conservatives can't attempt to denationalize industry until "a time when a moderate majority in the Labour Party" will agree that if something is denationalized and people invest their savings in it, Labour won't come along next time around and renationalize it.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

There is, of course, vague talk about who is to blame for exactly what. Mr. Pierre Rinfret, an economist, isn't vague about anything." Mr. Rinfret bears out this introduction in a slash-and-burn session that leaves neither politicians nor economists nor businessmen intact. "You didn't mention it... but I worked very extensively for Lyndon Johnson, and he threw me out of the Oval Room in January 1966 with the admonition I was never to come back." WFB: "What had you done to precipitate that?" PR: "Well, I had told him that he was lying to the American people about the war,... and that he was going to devastate the American economy by an increase in federal spending while he tried to run a Great Society, and there just wasn't enough room in the American economy to do both.... Now, you say, Why didn't business see it? Business did, but you've got to remember one thing about American industry. They're not going to stand and fight.

Mr. Buckley suggests--six years before Ronald Reagan's election to the Presidency--that "it is not inconceivable that what we will see in the next few years is an effort by theoretical conservatives to devise a means of building a bridge to blue-collar populists and that that, if it is successful, would constitute a numerical majority in most elections."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The immediate result was to help our farmers, our trade balance--and of course the Russians, in that Year of Detente. The result over the next two years had been sharp rises in our own food prices, over and above the general inflation we were suffering. Mr. Sosland is deeply knowledgeable, and the conversation ranges from the peculiar suitability of the Great Plains for growing wheat and corn, to the geopolitical aspects of selling anything into the world market. MIS: "I've kind of had the thesis all along that what the Soviet Union did... is to send out a signal to the rest of the world saying, 'Here is a Communist country that controls its people, is a police state, and we have to buy a billion dollars' worth of grain to keep our people satisfied and happy.' ... I mean, just eight years before, Russia,in a year of short crop, had had bread lines, had had rationing of bread."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Democracy per se doesn't get into it much, but the American character does, as we go from Mark Twain to soap operas to Gone with the Wind. One sample: WFB: "Well, I can't imagine, say, Mark Twain spending as much time thinking about himself as, say, Faulkner was forced to do given the dominance of the critics, which is a 20th-century phenomenon, isn't it?" LF: "No, not really.... Mark Twain worried a lot about the critics, and he worried a lot about himself, and he worried about who he was in typical American fashion, and he was always assuring people that he was not a funny fellow, and, you know, everybody laughed when he said it. And then he went home and he worried about it."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

He had been quickly defended, not in every particular but on the main point, by the Jewish journalist Stephen Isaacs. This lively discussion, full of detail, ranges from the Holocaust, to voting patterns of Jewish intellectuals, to the emotional effect of the 1967 Mideast War: SI: "Well, the Jew, up until that time, was this impression of a desk-bound, cowering sort of individual, who was led off, unprotesting, to a cattle car to be taken to his death. Well, '67 changed all that. Suddenly the Jew became a very strong person...When I was a kid growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, and I was a 230-pound tackle, the people there who had never met a Jew couldn't believe I was really a Jew...It just didn't fit with the image."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Simon energy czar, "and the American people were introduced to ... [this] cyclone from Wall Street who bedazzled the Congress, the bureaucracy, and the press, and got us through the winter." But oil was still $10 a barrel, and where do we go from here? The non-expert will have to pay close attention, but the issue of cartels and how to crack them is still very much with us. WFB: "In your conversations, for instance, with these leaders in the Persian Gulf, do you go so far as to say to them, 'Look, insofar as the United States suffers from this huge outlay for imported oil, it necessarily worsens its inflationary situation and it sets up domestic pressures ... to reduce the defense establishment; and to the extent that we proceed to dismantle our defense establishment, we are dismantling precisely the only thing that you can ultimately rely on to keep that oil yours rather than somebody else's'? Now, does their thinking extend that far... ?" WES: "These are extremely intelligent men, all with degrees-- I almost said that they're all American-educated. That doesn't make them extremely intelligent men, but they are experts in their particular fields and you don't have really to draw them pictures about this."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

(Historical piquancy: the others whom WFB mentions as serious candidates for 1976 are Henry Jackson, George Wallace, and Lloyd Bentsen.) But the substance of the conversation is on Mr. Udall's principal preoccupations: energy and the environment. Serious discussion ("If you're a businessman and you've got a paper mill, there are two ways you can do it. One is to foul up the Connecticut River. Another way is by increasing your costs 10 per cent and cutting your profit margin maybe by a third [and] and you can leave a clean river") mixed with fun and games: WFB: "But you use these value-loaded words, like 'binge.' Now--" MU: "That's unlike you. I've never read your columns or listened to you where value-oriented words were utilized. So I plead guilty to an aberration." WFB: "Well, no, I use them all the time, but I use them intending an effect." MU: "I do too."WFB: "But I don't mind if people examine the effect I intend."

Rhodes had become the House Republican leader, which is, says WFB, "a little like being made commander-in-chief of the German army after the Allies had crossed the Rhine." Mr. Rhodes's reaction to the carnage of November 5, which had left him in command of a force of 144, as against the Democrats' 291, had been to propose what WFB describes as "something called a consensus politics, a government by happy coalition of a Republican President and a Democratic Congress." Is this consistent with our two-party system? JJR: "Well, actually, Mr. Buckley, I think it's absolutely necessary ... I don't know any way you can avoid stalemate other than to have some sort of ground rules for working together." A fairly low-key conversation, but with some interesting insights on how the horse-trading gets done in areas where, as WFB puts it, "the end is not necessarily one that is unanimously backed."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

" An awesome philosophical question arises: whether the juxtaposition of that plenty and that want are spiritually tolerable. An altogether different question arises: whether, given all the good will in the world it would be possible to help the needy by taking from the sated." Father Hesburgh had been prominent among those urging the United States to make a serious commitment to sending food abroad. On this show the duty of the Christian conscience is taken care of in the first couple of paragraphs ("In fact in the very words of judgment that our Lord uses he puts it in terms of feeding and he says 'I was hungry and you gave me to eat...' "); from then on Father Hesburgh sounds like an agricultural economist speaking extremely knowledgeably about where the wheat is why we had been undersupplied the previous year and how quickly wheat would have to be loaded onto boats to do the starving countries any good.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Now, in the Arab world, in Asia, in Africa, their modern life begins by the First World War.... And in sixty years the Arabs cannot attain the democratic institutions we have evolved in the West over four or five hundred years").

MTM: "Well, let us give the Palestinians, who are now engaged in this horrible thing of terrorism, let us give them a thousand tanks. Let us give them five hundred Phantom jets." WFB: "Well, you can afford it. Why don't you?" MTM: "Let the U.S. give them." WFB: "Well, why?" MTM: "The United States has been giving these things to Israel, and I'm suggesting if the United States gave a thousand tanks to the Palestinians, five hundred airplanes to the Palestinians, then those Palestinians would never engage in such silly stupid terroristic acts and they will send their Phantom jets to destroy Tel Aviv, and good."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Enter Judge Arthur Garrity,with his angrily protested Boston busing decision. In defending the extension of civil-rights remedies to Northern de-facto segregation, Mr. Jordan speaks, often movingly, of his own upbringing under Jim Crow, and puts the busing question into context: "You know,... busing pursuant to court orders is only about 3 per cent of the kids bused ...[whereas] something like 40 per cent of the kids traditionally have been bused in this country. I mean, busing is as American as apple pie or Yale or Harvard or Howard. And it never became a great issue until such time that somebody who had this kind of skin sat on that bus...." WFB: "Yes. If you took, let's say, a busload of Bostonians and insisted that they be driven 45 miles a day to Groton and back ... they probably wouldn't complain that much."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

There was an international uproar, as if the Marines had already been dispatched to the Persian Gulf." Mr. Tucker had then published a piece in Commentary exploring how the OPEC cartel had developed, how it might be broken, and how oil affected America's position in the Cold War world.

The issue, as Mr. Buckley phrases it, "affects Episcopalians and their fellow travelers theologically, but also the whole English-speaking world culturally," because of the beauty of the Prayer Book's language and its influence on four centuries of English literature. Not surprisingly to anyone who has followed liturgical disputes, today's discussion is matched in heatedness only by shows on the Middle East. HW: "Instead of saying that our Lord was 'conceived by the Holy Ghost,' the new version of the Creed says that he was 'conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit.'

WFB: "In what kind of society does the individual have the maximum mobility?

H. Auden, Stephen Spender had spent the Thirties, as WFB puts it, "dancing along the precipice, attempting at once literary integrity and Communist fellow traveling." And like Auden, he recovered from that infatuation with totalitarianism--in Mr. Spender's case, in time to be the first editor of the urbanely anti-Communist Encounter (whose funding by the CIA had later been disclosed). No fireworks on this show, but illuminating discussion of the connections between art and politics. SS: "Henry Moore was a very strong anti-fascist during the Thirties. At the time, he was doing nothing but abstract sculpture, and it worried him quite a lot that he wasn't doing sort of heroic anti-fascist sculpture. But then he decided that this would be completely false to his own sort of vision ... One might, from a left-wing point of view, find it very difficult to see this. However, the totalitarians see it very well, because they discover nothing more dangerous than abstract sculpture."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Serious penology alternates with (pointed) flights of fancy. WS: "What if [Governor Nelson] Rockefeller had gone to Attica? There he is outside the gates. The prisoners say, 'Let's see Rockefeller. We'll talk to him direct.' At that point he can't show that he's a coward; he has to go in and talk to them. And at that point, the possibility of taking him hostage arises. Then what do you do?" WFB: "That presents the opportune time to remold the Republican Party." ... TW: "In the prisons of the State of New York, just a year or so before the Attica revolt, everything was changed over semantically. Guards became 'corrections officers.' Prisons became 'correctional facilities.' Wardens became 'superintendents.' You had to rewrite all those old James Cagney movies. But they didn't change anything else. They just changed the terminology."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB starts right in: "I should like to begin by asking Mr. Lewis whether, as a historical matter, he opposed General Kutuzov's scorched-earth policy after Napoleon marched into Moscow." AL: "A scorched-earth policy may be very admirable. If people decide, say, that they want their country to be Russia and they don't want France to run it, and they decide to fight to the last man, that's like the Alamo, and it arouses one's emotions. But it's very different when the United States decides to fight to the last Cambodian; it's just not our affair." WFB: "But it's not American soldiers who are fighting; it's Cambodians." AL: "Yes. Cambodians. Not Russians. Not North Vietnamese. Cambodians."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But the discussion between these two old friends soon deepens in surprising ways. CBL: "Do you think it's possible for a man to be a Christian and not a feminist? ... Jesus Christ was the first feminist.... If you read the Gospels, you'll be astounded at the number of miracles he performs at the request of women.... The whole evidence is that he had some extraordinary mission to women; otherwise you cannot account for their love and loyalty and devotion." ... WFB: "But there's an elision in your argument. You talk about Christ being a feminist, you talk about our tradition leading us in this direction, and all of a sudden this direction turns out to be ERA. And you leave us almost necessarily committed to the proposition that it is the fruit of Christian activity."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

A state in the Deep South, South Carolina no less, had elected a Republican governor, for the first time since Reconstruction. All the psephologists and futurists stuck that into their computers, and concluded that if such a thing could happen here, a great deal in America has changed." A lively discussion bouncing back and forth between practical politics and ideological divisions. JBE: "Bill, I think that we've gone through this before. After ... Goldwater's defeat, there were all of these terrible predictions that the Republican Party was through ... And I have a strong feeling that if... we have a candidate who has a track record that proves that he in fact does believe in the great principles ... I think that we'll make the most tremendous comeback that has ever been made ..." WFB: "Well, you've described the ideal candidate." JBE: "Well, I guess I did." WFB: "Yes. Were you describing President Ford?" JBE: "Well-- Bill, you know,... President Ford, I think, is a great fellow, an awfully nice fellow, and he's trying to do what's right and best, but I think he's surrounded himself by people who may not be interested in the same things that Jerry Ford's interested in."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The problem arises, as Mr. Lowenstein explains, because "the trial... didn't deal with these [ballistics] issues because Sirhan's attorney announced that he had murdered Kennedy and that the issue was his sanity.... So none of this evidence was entered in the trial at all." Why does it matter? As Mr. Buckley works through it, "It strikes me as unlikely, given the fact that everybody agrees, including yourself, that Sirhan Sirhan was trying to kill Kennedy, that merely identifying somebody else who was also trying to kill him is going to excite the sort of inquisitive appetites of our people.

Wade. Mr. Stevas tells of the brutalizing effects of the new abortion law in Britain: "Since it has been legalized, it has become surrounded by rackets, and the only post-operative action that anyone takes is to sell the fetuses to soap factories." Mrs. Hentoff is "a little bit irritated that all those who think of themselves as humanists, as always pro-life, see this killing of fetuses as something that fits in with a liberal, humanist, nonviolent philosophy, when in fact it is killing." Mr. O'Rourke agrees that abortion is killing, but argues that "The real way to stop this brutal business of killing is to out love it, not to outlaw it, because having prohibitory legislation at this point would really reinstitutionalize the killing of mothers."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What would become of, as WFB puts it, "the umbrella under the protection of which sovereign European nations have felt free to act wisely or foolishly without, at any rate, risking the conclusive retaliation against foolishness which only super powers are in a position to inflict"? A fascinating discussion that takes as its theme the parallels between the American pullout from Vietnam and the West's ceding Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. One sample: BL: "After all,... the Allied statesmen... knew very well what an abominable fraud the Yalta agreement was. They felt, at the same time, there was nothing they could do about it, so that they might as well make the best deal they could ..." WFB: "Why was there a greater sense of futility when they were triumphant than there was when they were utterly impoverished and shouted back at the Nazi gale with really quite galvanizing effect in 1939?" BL: "Because, I think, in 1939, Britain in general, people and politicians alike, realized rightly that our existence was at stake. Now, at the end of the war, when Europe was being carved up,... the threat was not immediate. Bombs were not falling out of the sky in 1945."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Messrs. Buckley and Knight examine strictly economic factors but also, and importantly, the political aspect. WFB: "Sometimes you are talking as though people are educable, and sometimes you are talking as though people are invincibly ignorant. Now my notion is that people who are swept away with enthusiasm for socialist generalities tend to be, certainly not uneducated, but most probably invincibly ignorant." ... AK: "The fact is that a politician's got to get in, he's got to win votes, and winning votes is not always consonant with sage economic theory." WFB: "There again it depends on the position. Having said you don't want any absolute pure economic laws, you're now making absolute political laws." AK: "Oh, yes, there is an absolute political law, and that is, 'I want to be re-elected.'

WFB: "I quoted Henry Kissinger's words exactly."

However, the Senator brings specific knowledge of the current state of play: "Well, I've not found any evidence of whatever the [Ford] Administration means by detente involving a two-way operation. Trade is the one that's talked about most. But the Soviets are talking about credit, not ...trade in the traditional sense. They haven't anything to sell us." WFB: "Peace."

The discussion is often technical with regard to elasticity of demand and substitutability of other resources, but the exchanges are spirited: WFB "How can you call it oppression? In the first place, Americans discovered the oil. You tax them. It costs you 20 cents to take a barrel of oil out of the ground. You sell it for $1.75. I don't call that exploitation."

WFB: "Well, it's ... the 200th anniversary of The Wealth of Nations, and Adam Smith would have considered it perfectly legitimate to tell people what to do insofar as it was necessary to conserve natural resources ..." RWP: "Adam Smith talked, as you well remember, about the invisible hand ...

As Mr. Buckley points out, "the book mercilessly dissects a social phenomenon, the hold of a few art critics on art, fashion, and the grotesqueries to which a middle class is willing to submit in order to distinguish itself from the philistia whence it came." One sample from Mr. Wolfe: "The game of Jeopardy is played by giving someone the answer to a question and then they have to give you the question. And this is what art became after 1945. The paintings became the answer-it's a puzzle picture-to the question. Start with Abstract Expressionism; Pop Art was the same thing; Minimal Art, Op Art, Conceptual Art, and so on. Now, this is something, despite the demurs of many, many people within the field of art- It's absolutely a new situation. There's never been a situation before in which you have to say, 'Yes, but what's the theory?' when you look at a painting or piece of sculpture."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "The columnist Garry Wills has written that Mr. White has his own 'enemies list' and that he specifies with whom he will and will not appear to discuss his book. ..." THW: "I do solemnly affirm that I have no enemies list. There are people I dislike and people I disagree with. I have no enemies list. I am not out to get anybody. There is and was a Nixon's enemies list. The most frightening thing--if you asked me what brought about the impeachment of the President--was that cold chill that ran down the spine of the Judiciary Committee on those critical words in the September 15 transcript. Mind you, this is before the election; it's 1972. He's talking to John Dean, Richard Nixon is, and he says he wanted Dean to tell the fellows at CREEP [the Committee to Re-Elect the President] that this is war and to behave themselves like war. And then he says, 'Make a list.' He said, 'We haven't used the power this first four years.' He said, 'We haven't used the Bureau, we haven't used the Department of Justice; but now we're going to use them all.' That's frightening language to come from a President about to win the greatest landslide in American history." (But Henry Kissinger, Firing Line s1202.)</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A lively show, beginning with the specifics of Mr. Halperin's case and moving to general questions of secrecy, privacy, and national security. WFB: "The Congress of the United States, when it set up the Central Intelligence Agency, proceeded on an assumption that was not then challenged, and has only fairly recently been challenged, which is that you can't have a Central Intelligence Agency that goes on the Today show every morning to announce what it's up to."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

President Ford agreed; a pleasant though not earth-shattering conversation ensued; but when Mr. Anderson took his film to first one network and then another, each refused it. Whereupon Mr. Buckley offered Firing Line as a venue for viewing the film and discussing "the implications of [the] experience. The President of the United States talks for one half hour about his feelings about America and his hopes for it, and the poor man can't get on TV. Permit me to express the doubt (a) that it would have happened to President Kennedy, or (b) that President Kennedy would have tolerated its happening to him." (This show's title refers to Press Secretary Ron Nessen's charge that Mr. Anderson had "conned" the President by implying that he had a firm deal with a network, which Mr. Anderson categorically denies. WFB: "So therefore he had no reason to be surprised?" JA: "He couldn't have been surprised.")</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Your point of view is more that of the mortician here, isn't it, as regards the Republican Party?" WAR: "Well. I don't know. I'm a bereaved member of the party, let's put it that way. There's no doubt that the party is for any practical purposes dead. If we conservatives don't bury the Republican Party, I'm afraid the Republican Party is going to bury us." ... PJB: "It seems to me that Governor Reagan, if he's going to run, has committed himself to the Republican Party--" WAR: "No, he hasn't." PJB: "--that Senator Goldwater and Senator Tower and Senator Brock and Senator Dole and Bill Simon and James Schlesinger and the economic conservatives who are half of this grand coalition are going to be within the Republican Party--" WAR: "Not all of them." PJB: "--in the summer of 1976, and that the only way for the conservative coalition to win in '76 in my judgement is to bring the social conservatives of the Democratic Party within the Republican ranks." A sparkling four-cornered exchange rich in ironies, given the failure of Mr. Rusher's third party in 1976, the success of Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Mr. Buchanan's jumping to a third party in 2000.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Stanton Evans--was celebrating its 15th anniversary in Chicago this weekend, although, as WFB puts it, about all they had to celebrate was "their own survival and their remarkably good spirits." Certainly there wasn't much to celebrate on the national or international political scene; and while the campuses had calmed down, they were still, as Mr. Docksai reports, "liberal finishing schools." (Not that that's all bad: as Mr. Donatelli reports, "When they wanted the conservative viewpoint, they'd come to me. You know, I'm a 20-year-old kid at the time. And so it makes one, I think, become mature much faster.") This conversation among comrades-in-arms bounces back and forth from the campuses to grown-up politics in a pleasant 15-handed ping-pong match.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "American[s]... who have traveled to China--people like Ken Galbraith, Scotty Reston, Barbara Tuchman--come back and, sure enough, we hear those old voices from the Thirties, 'The trains are running on time.' Now, how can a free society husband the moral flywheel necessary to distinguish between desirable and undesirable societies in the wake of such relativism as is stimulated by the philosophy of detente?" HK: "First, let me say that if one pushed your argument to a conclusion, one would have to say that the United States must maintain international tensions in order to make sure that its people have the correct perception of the nature of the societies with which they are dealing.

At this time, she had been Party Leader for seven months, having defeated former Prime Minister Edward Heath. Today's discussion focuses on domestic issues, particularly the need to generate revenues not through higher tax rates but through economic growth. This, Mrs. Thatcher explains, "is not only a matter of equity: it is also that the privileged few have already been reduced to such a very few by thirty years' punitive taxation that even total confiscation would not yield enough to do much for the poor. MT: We've had a very interesting Royal Commission sitting on the distribution of incomes and wealth, and what they've shown-- contrary to what those who set up the Commission thought it would show--... is that your top 1 per cent have about four times the average income; the top 10 per cent have about twice the average income; down at the bottom, the lowest 10 per cent have about half the average income.

We had 1.2 per cent inflation per year; we have more than that per month these days. Profits doubled in the four years I was Chairman of the Council. And as you quite correctly point out, we had a rather moderate overall expansionary program in the early part of that period. ... Inflation didn't start, really, until Lyndon Johnson failed to finance Vietnam with tax increases." WFB: "Yes." WWH: "What was different is that we had no oil-price explosion; we had no food-price explosion; we had no devaluation; we had no sudden release from economic controls; we had no worldwide commodity boom. All five of those things belabored and beleaguered us and touched off the ferocious inflation of 1973-1974.

So when they accept negotiations, it means they're going to win. You know, in the mind of European people, when you talk about negotiations, you think of mutual concessions on both sides.

The discussion here begins with South Vietnam, which had just fallen to the Communists, and moves through the Persian Gulf and Soviet power generally, to broader questions such as the difficulties of foreign policy in a democracy. JS: "I believe that if all of us speak out on these issues, the American public will respond, and politicians are quite sensitive to the attitudes of the public." WFB: "Well, I think they'd be awfully sensitive if we lost Israel or something. But are they sensitive in advance of the situation that is militarily intolerable? ..." JS: "No." WFB: "In the Persian Gulf area, do you think that we are as strong as we ought to be?" JS: "I think that we have the capacity to match the Soviet buildup in that area and to balance the power that they introduce into that area ... What I'm concerned about are the trends ..., not the situation at the present time." WFB: "And I guess your point is that however spooky those trends appear to be, we have not reached irreversibility and won't?" JS: "Quite right.

WFB: "There you go with 'the public interest.'

VB: "You could look at a photograph of Hitler in high school in a group of fifty people, and right away you'd focus on his eyes. That was not Manson's typical look: he was a visual schizophrenic. He could sit down and talk with you the way I am right now, about football, tennis, anything, and then you might look away from him and then back--and in that momentary interlude, his face would become [transformed] and he'd have that maniacal stare."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On April 15, the 21-year-old woman had taken a combination of tranquilizers and alcohol that had left her comatose, with severe brain damage. Her parents, after consulting with their parish priest, had asked the doctor to turn off the respirator; he refused; the parents sued; the judge had just ruled in favor of the doctor. (The following spring the New Jersey Supreme Court reversed that decision. The respirator was turned off; Miss Quinlan lived for another nine years, never regaining consciousness.) Mr. Porzio had defended Miss Quinlan's doctor; Dr. Heifetz had testified for the petitioners. A profound discussion of this agonizing issue, starting off with an earlier case involving a court-ordered blood transfusion for a young Jehovah's Witness. Dr. Heifetz: "The court had a right to say, 'Well, there's an element of doubt in this case. Would she waver? We think maybe she would.' ... What the court did was order the blood, which was correct, but instead of using that as their argument-which would therefore put it into the basis of the right of self-determination-they said there is no constitutional right to die. This is as inane as saying there's no constitutional right to eat apple pie."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Our guests--each the author of a recent book on crime and criminals--explore causes and potential methods of deterrence, trenchantly and imaginatively. (Among other things, Mr. van den Haag floats his idea of exiling repeat criminals to a remote town set aside for them, until they have reached an age at which statistics suggest they are not likely to return to crime.) JQW: "There is no clinical evidence I know of that the population of prisons, of criminals generally, is any less rational, or indeed on the average any less intelligent, than the average person. ... They tend to be younger, and have a higher taste for risk than stodgy middle-aged conservative people like ourselves, but they are no different in their ability to calculate the likely consequences of their acts."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Most Jewish leaders had "interpreted [this] as a vote encouraging anti-Semitism throughout the world," but not Mr. Lilienthal, who believes that "Zionism in its treatment both of Jews and non-Jews is racist. If you're surprised when I say, 'both of Jews,' it's because ... under the Law of Return it does not consider [Jews] as full citizens in the countries in which they live, but merely as potential citizens." Mr. Riebenfeld takes the bull by the horns--"I'd like to say that it is rather unusual to refer to Dr. Lilienthals ... as a Jewish leader. ... As a matter of fact he prefers not to call himself a Jew but a Judaist"--and we're off and running.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

They and their host (who had just returned from his third trip to Russia) range back and forth across this rich tapestry, from the scientist's laboratory to the Kirov Ballet School, from Solzhenitsyn to the Russian Navy, from Czar Nicholas II to Nikita Khrushchev. Mr. Kaiser, re an Intourist guide's resisting Mr. Buckley's wish to visit Nicholas and Alexandra's country palace: "This is part of a gaping inferiority complex felt by the czar's successors, a terrible insecurity about their own legitimacy ... The commissars understood that the czars were members of this great family, were respected and revered in all the courts of Europe, were recognized universally as the legitimate rulers of Russia. And they were the usurpers." ... Mr. Smith on why the Soviets buy Japanese, German, and American technology instead of developing it themselves: HS: "It seems to me that there's more than legitimacy that they're afraid to test.... You're afraid of the dynamism and the spin-off of that dynamism if you let your own inventive and talented people free."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Secretary of Transportation William Coleman would be ruling on this a few days after this taping; in the event, he gave a careful and reasoned ruling in favor of a 16-month experiment, but that would not stop the complaints---from people living near the airports and concerned about noise; from people like Mr. Hellegers, concerned about the effect on the ozone layer ("the whole business about doing anything about the environment is that as soon as you go to one person and say, 'You're creating a problem,' he says, 'Well, look at all these other people. Go and take care of them. Give me liberty and give them death'"); and from U.S. airlines claiming that government subsidies for the Concorde constituted unfair competition (JC: "In America ... the indirect subsidy, particularly in terms of commercial airliners, has come ... via huge defense contracts.

Wouldn't you have done more for yourself, for your soul, for your troops, and for the prestige of the United States military?" WW: "I kept, apropos of your question, on my desk a quotation from Napoleon which said in essence that if a field commander has policies imposed upon him which he feels will eventually bring about the defeat of his army, he should resign rather than obey those orders.

Steadily declining test scores, remedial reading being needed at the most selective colleges, disciplinary problems at all levels. Mr. Riles, Mr. Buckley tells us, "in his quiet, non-dogmatic way ... has reassured many people that some sort of progress is being made." This proves to a nicely detailed examination of education issues, ranging from the reliability of test scores, to the question of who should receive higher education, to Nelson Rockefeller’s dyslexia. WR: "We've found that older students really stimulate youngsters. I taught first in a one-room school, and I did not have the sophisticated terminology about cross-age tutoring--that's what they call it today.

A key member of King Juan Carlos's cabinet was Mr. Fraga, widely acknowledged, Mr. Buckley reminds us, as "the architect of the great transition from the government of General Franco-which was essentially government by one man-to government by a body of men, to an extent as yet undetermined responsible to the Spanish people." A rich discussion that ranges from international terrorism, to the isolating effect of Spain's geography, to the acceptance of Vatican II by the Spanish Church, to the different forms democracy can, and must, take. MFI: "Societies have, well, social realities, and on the other hand they have psychological trends. It shows you that the same system which is convenient, even if you accept the same general principles of law and justice, is not necessarily convenient for America and, say, Congo-Kinshasa.

JMA: "I think that is part of the great strategic risk the West takes vis-a-vis the tremendous amount of nuclear weapons on the other side, and as long as the SALT negotiations don't settle all that in a definite way-and I don't see that they are settling it yet-the risk is there, and we must commit ourselves honestly."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "Well, why didn't we recognize that with Hitler? Hitler made many more people tingle than Ho Chi Minh did, and he would have been an extremely effective buffer between us and the Soviet Union." AK: "No, because- Well, you see, we're talking- WFB: "I think it's very hard to establish that Hitler killed more people per capita ... than Ho Chi Minh did. Ho Chi Minh had the grace to write poetry about it and occasionally weep. But all these tingly people in history like Alexander and Napoleon and Lenin and so on and so forth give me the creeps...."

For that matter, how was its counterpart, roughly speaking, the KGB? Mr. Walker was known as one of the sharpest critics of the CIA, Mr. Copeland as one of its most able advocates. The conversation starts out genially enough, with Mr. Walker giving a detailed and funny description of a couple of British intelligence operations in Northern Ireland, but the gloves come off when Mr. Copeland brings up Mr. Walker's spending time "with Philip Agee [whose activities were blamed for the deaths of several agents], chasing around identifying CIA agents, as you call them--" MW: "Look. I'm a journalist. I’m a journalist. ... Who are CIA agents in London is a matter of proper concern to me as a reporter. ... It's a matter of proper concern to my readers, particularly when America calls Britain her closest and most natural ally. In fact, you're treating us like a client state.

(To quote briefly from Mr. Solzhenitsyn himself, "I am not a critic of the West. I repeat that for nearly all our lives we worshipped the West.... I am not a critic of the West. I am a critic of the weakness of the West. I am a critic of a fact which we can't comprehend: how one can lose one's spiritual strength, one's will power, and, possessing freedom, not to value it, not to be willing to make sacrifices for it.") After the interview, WFB and his guests have a few minutes left to comment. Mr. Muggeridge: "Its impact is due to the fact that it is absolutely true. You see, what Solzhenitsyn has said is at an entirely different level from the comments that go on about our world on television, by politicians. It's in terms of truth. It's in terms of good and evil. It's in terms ultimately of the Christian faith." Mr. Levin: "I would like to say this: that although undoubtedly Solzhenitsyn is a man lit from within by grace, there are others-Sakharov is the obvious example-who are not; who take it simply from what you might call moral pragmatism. As far as I know Sakharov has no religious faith, and yet here is the man who demonstrates, just as Solzhenitsyn, that you cannot-whatever you do and however long you do it-extinguish the spark of freedom in human beings."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

AA: "I think the most fortunate thing that happened to me as counselor to two Presidents was that for both of them one of my main jobs was to travel extensively. And my heart would leap in direct relationship as I got farther away from the Potomac, and as I got into the real country.

In this often uproarious hour, Messrs. Rubin and Rader regret some of the causes they supported then (like the Khmer Rouge) but are unshakably proud that, as Mr. Rubin puts it, "I was part of a generation that risked jail, that risked physical injury ... to oppose a war that was destructive to America." ...

During her trial, WFB explains, "the legal community was especially alerted to the historical point that never before ... had a jury been asked to accept brainwashing as a legal defense." The jury didn't buy it, and Miss Hearst was sentenced to seven years in prison (the sentence would be commuted by President Carter in 1979). Dr. Fort's "dramatic exchanges with Lee Bailey [the head of the defense team] in the courtroom were," says WFB, "the subject of considerable attention," and his exchanges with Mr. Dershowitz here give us a window on one of the more bizarre incidents in that bizarre period. AD: "That may very well be the central issue pressed on the appeal: whether or not Patricia Hearst was actually tried for what she did on the day of the bank robbery, or whether she was tried for what she became after the bank robbery and indeed perhaps in part as a result of the bank robbery." ... JF: "Well, brainwashing on the model of Chinese thought reform done to American soldiers in Korea 25 years ago has very little relationship to the American youth behavior and to American society in the 1970s."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Feldstein concisely explains the difference between his recommendations and their bill: "As far as I can tell, they mean [to achieve] 3 per cent [unemployment] by pushing on demand, cutting taxes, spending more, making money more readily available, and, if that fails, simply hiring people into the public sector; while I had in mind not simply increasing demand but rather changes in the incentives and the structure for labor markets that would cause unemployment to fall without any abnormal increases in demand." Mr. Buckley asks Professor Feldstein to help us out with some definitions (of, e.g., frictional unemployment), opening the way for a rich discussion that includes the effects of welfare and the minimum wage, the situation in England and Sweden, and the effects of increased productivity on quality of life.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On paper, their chances looked good: after all, "the much-heralded constitution of 1936 probably lists more human rights than any constitution in the world," and the Procurator General of the Soviet Union, Roman Rudenko, had been a colleague of Mr. Taylor's at Nuremberg. Even so, the lawyers' initiative failed, and Mr. Taylor explains why in this serious discussion, rich in detail. TT: "In order to achieve heavier penalties and strike more fear into others who would want to emigrate the law is simply distorted and set aside .... A person who wants to emigrate knows that if he gets in trouble with the law it's all up-conviction is certain; guarantees are going to be set aside. This is very much more of a threat to other [potential emigrants] than the possibility of a fair trial."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

STA: "You notice, in this case, the President does not directly order. He can. The sanctions available to him are simply to call the Vice President in and say, 'Look,Mr. Vice President, this is enough of this. I don't want any more.'

Admiral Zumwalt had told Ronald Reagan--who had used the information in a speech--that Mr. Kissinger had frequently said, as WFB paraphrases it, that "the United States was fated to be the second-ranking power in the world and that it was the responsibility of the Secretary of State to see to it that in our negotiations the U.S. came out as strong as possible under the circumstances." Mr. Kissinger had heatedly denied this; Mr. Buckley wonders whether even if Admiral Zumwalt was quoting accurately it was proper to repeat a private conversation. EZ: "With regard to the scruples, the problem is a tough one... In my view the higher requirement is to get the debate out on the terms we need to debate it on; namely, this tragic view of the future which is leading us on a policy course ... which is very hard to understand in the light of the public explanation of it being given by Kissinger. Rather than to dissemble in the public view as he does, I think it's important to raise openly the question of his tragic view of the future and to have it debated."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Thus the meeting between Doris Kearns and Lyndon Johnson" and the beginning of a "long and curious and, by the way, platonic relationship [during which] ... he would talk nonstop about his hopes, dream, fears, and superstitions." One sample from this somewhat surreal but fascinating conversation. WFB: "You had a sense that when he talked to you sometimes those soliloquies were dangerous to interrupt, right?" DK: "Oh yes. I mean, it wasn't that. I mean, if I could recreate his physical presence as it was. He wouldn't be sitting back in a chair like you now, which is not very threatening to me. He would be leaning over, breathing down my neck as he was giving me that soliloquy, which makes you much more terrified to say, 'But sir!'

This show was not intended to be purely a pitch for Ronald Reagan: Mr. Ford's campaign, Mr. Buckley tells us, "has had two weeks to designate a representative but has not succeeded in doing so." Mr. Sears, a moderate Republican, would wind up managing Mr. Reagan's next campaign for the Presidency, too, until his spectacular dismissal in the snows of New Hampshire. Here, he does well at focusing on the details: e.g., on how difficult it will be for Gerald Ford, if he wins the nomination, to put together a general election campaign: "Mr. Ford has no personal constituency in the South ... the only way he could have won there would have been if the Democrats had nominated a liberal Democrat who was not from the South. They did not do that ... that forces [Ford] up into the Northeast and Middle West ... And yet the positions he's taken in order to try to fend off Mr. Reagan's candidacy are not ones that he could drop that quickly to go run the other way.

Here they look at Jimmy Carter, the newly nominated Democratic candidate, and at the economy and our tax policies. Mr. Galbraith on liberals' nervousness about Governor Carter: "Well, liberals have their own establishment, which isn't quite as tightly knit and exclusive a circle as those of you who surround Ronald Reagan perhaps, but of the same sort. And Governor Carter was from outside, an unfamiliar figure--not the sort of man of whom my friends could automatically feel that if he were elected, they would be in." ...

Murrow) of the television documentary, are both close students of the Fairness Doctrine and its metastasis, from modest beginnings in 1949 to the engine of pervasive regulation it had become. But let Mr. Friendly set the stage: "There's a great contradiction in the whole broadcast system. 'Congress shall make no law,' the First Amendment says. I.e., you shall not license printing presses. And yet when broadcasting came along, it was necessary to license some people. Therefore you were giving a license, and you were saying broadcasters must operate in the public interest, convenience, necessity, and you were saying that they had to let other points of view be seen and heard on the air. I think that's a pretty good idea. I think you are a fiduciary. But I think where you get into trouble is when the government tries to be the super-referee."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

AL: "It's a strange policy doctrine that says it's healthy to have a multiplicity of options for students in college, but that we should enforce conformity at the primary and secondary levels." ... LP: "Any effort on the part of government to interfere with the full freedom of religious institutions in pursuit of their sacred mission would be just as much a violation of the Constitution as any effort of the government to promote, through financial grant, that same mission."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"We have a very interesting paradox going on right now. It's something nobody wants to talk about. We may not have in this country right now enough capital to put every American to work. I can give you the analogy in a very simple way: ten machines, eleven people looking for work, and only one man can work at one machine at a time. So you can put people to work and the eleventh guy is going to stand there ... We may be in that problem of having underinvested, overconsumed under an ancient antique concept of the 1930s. Consumption is not our problem. And yet every President that comes along,Congress comes along and says, 'Stimulate consumption; we need more consumption.'... So they keep wondering why they're not getting economic growth."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "But those are the people who usually make the wars, aren't they?" GWB: "Well, that's one of your myths, I know, Mr. Buckley"), but as we roam the Cold War world from Rhodesia to Vietnam to the Soviet Union we get fascinating recollections from someone who has been on the scene since the Nuremberg trials and was now being rumored as possible Secretary of State in a Carter Administration. GWB: "You asked me whether it's ever desirable for the Administration to lie. I can only-- The reason that I hesitated related to a very personal experience." Mr. Ball had been a member of the group within the Kennedy Administration trying to figure out what to do during the Cuban missile crisis, "Well, we had a rational, coherent policy which we did finally evolve and which worked. We couldn't have done it-- I mean we would have been in terrible shape if there had been a premature disclosure. Now ...

GWB: "Well, I talked about economics, but then they got up and asked me about missiles in Cuba. And I gave them as equivocal answers as I could, doing my best to try not to mislead them.... I then went back and spent the entire night as I had been doing every night, in the so-called think tank we had, trying to sort these things out."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

ZB: "If you go beyond simple events, simple facts, the process of defining what reality is becomes enormously complex. Now, we can state as a proposition, assuming we know the facts, that very recently Mao Tse-tung died. And if we have access to information we can say exactly when he died. That's presumably an uncontestable fact, although even sometimes that can be contested. But beyond that, when you begin to assess what this means for the Chinese regime, what its implications are, even before you move into prescriptions, your assessment of that reality becomes inherently more difficult and invariably more subjective."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Both guests immediately challenge the term "burglary": MF: "The dictionary defines a burglary as a break-in with the intent to steal something, and what I authorized were two surreptitious entries to try and get information." (Mr. Felt's break-ins were to offices of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Weathermen)"And I think by authorizing it I saved a lot of lives.") Mr. Cohn concurs: "Oh, these are not burglaries. The term is just completely misused here. Nothing was stolen; nothing was taken." WFB: "Well, nothing was stolen from Dr. Fielding's office, but that was a burglary, wasn't it?" RC: "No, I don't think that was a burglary. I think the correct term here would probably be surreptitious entry... . And I've been on both sides. I worked with the government, and I practice law and defend people where the FBI is on the other side, so I've seen it from both vantage points."

There has been, I think we would all agree, some difficulty in transcribing these positions, which is why we have such expert help here in the studio." They do eventually get to candidate Carter's positions and how they may have changed--on the economy, especially, and abortion--but only after a rich discussion of how his Christianity strikes the opinion-making elite. WS: "We've just had two Presidents back to back, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, both of whom in different ways seemed to suffer from a certain megalomania, and it's thought that all we'd need now would be to have a third one who had megalomania touched with religious afflatus, to borrow one of your words...."WFB: "Is it the provenance of the authority that disturbs your set?" WS: "I think so,yes. Not my set. You're as much of this set as I am. You and I happen to be exceptions in that-- You are still a Christian, Bill?" WFB: "Yes." WS: "Yes.... But I think that most people who edit the news on television or radio--" WFB: "Are atheistic Communists?" WS: "No, just mildly bemused agnostics, I would say." ... HC: "I think Jimmy Carter's religion, to a number of the people who live in the set you may travel in, again more than I, is an affront to a number of hard-earned--as they see it--values that they have, their escape from whatever heritages of their own past, religious particularly, and cultural."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Secretary of State Kissinger and the Panamanian negotiators had in 1974 reached an agreement in principle, but any actual treaty would require ratification by the Senate, and the proposal had stirred up a hornet's nest back home, becoming a hot issue in the Republican presidential primaries (as it would again in 1980 even though the treaty was eventually ratified in 1978--see Firing Line s0306). Dr. Cheveille and Mr. Chapman point out that the Panamanians' demands did not come out of the blue: Mr. Cheveille reminds us that "The earliest treaty, the 1903 treaty, has been renegotiated several times," and that Lyndon Johnson had agreed in 1964 to something very like the current proposal, but the war in Indochina and the war on America's campuses had put it on hold. Today's discussion ranges from the negotiation of the original treaty, to current issues of U.S. national security, to, with Archbishop McGrath, issues of peace and justice.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

In terms of intellectual substance, we get the idea right from the outset that we should not expect too much ("I first of all want to thank the American people for being nice and letting me go into their living rooms through this television set"). But it is fun watching WFB try to drag a straight answer out of his guest: WFB: "Well, let me try to put it differently. Archbishop McGrath, your archbishop, wrote an article in which he said that an example of American exploitation of the treaty is that it created military installations for which it paid money at a far lesser rate than, for instance, it pays money to Spain for its installations. So my question is whether you endorse that analysis of Archbishop McGrath's." DL: "Please, he's our spiritual leader, thank the Lord." WFB: "He's not only your spiritual leader." DL: "He's my very good friend." WFB: "He's my friend too, I hope. But he's also somebody who's perfectly prepared to concern himself with secular matters, isn't he?"

This show is an anthology of memorable clips-some lasting several minutes, others just a couple of paragraphs-from this first decade's shows. But first, a few words from WFB about Firing Line itself: "Our aim is to get people who have something to say. They can say it on Firing Line without having to jump over roadblocks every few minutes. They can indulge their own styles of thought and speech. They can be frenetic or leisurely. They need only to watch their logic, and be prepared to examine previously unexamined deposits of prejudice, if they are burdened by them. Firing Line is devoted to the proposition that interesting people can be interesting through the course of an entire hour. Failures at this level have been very few. But then, to quote the buoyant observation of Harold Nicolson, 'Ninety-nine people out of a hundred are interesting; and the hundredth is interesting because he is the exception.'"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "Firing Line was never conceived as an 'interview.' It was conceived, and indeed the original contract specifically called for an 'exchange of opinion.' The idea was that a conservative position on many matters of public policy tends to be ignored, or trivialized, in a mighty communications industry wired to the pressure points of contemporary and even trendy American liberalism. Accordingly, the producers thought, why not experiment and see if a conservative view of current affairs could survive the battering, week after week, of expert proponents of the Left?"</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

These three old pros give us a tour, rich in detail, of the policies and personalities. WFB: "Do the returns ... suggest that the Republican Party carries a stigma which it appears incapable of a cleansing, so that people who want a crack at public life are extremely reluctant to proceed under the sponsorship of the Republican Party? ..." RR: "I think, yes, there is a stigma ... On the other hand,... the election laws are designed to perpetuate the two-party system, so that once you get the Republican nomination you can do anything you want with it--run as an attractive young alternative, or, as Hayakawa did in California, as an attractive old alternative running against the majority party." ... JK: "The first thing I think I'll say is that... it seems to me to be very very much an un-landmark election ... But in answer specifically to your question, it would seem to me that there are several good indices for the Republicans. First of all, they elected some young, fresh faces--Lugar, Wallop, for example. Secondly,... when a state like New Jersey, which I think has unemployment of over 11 per cent, goes Republican, it seems to me that the Democrats ought to be scratching their heads a little bit and worrying a lot."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The unspoken sentiment is that Venezuela may soon emerge as the principal spokesman for South America." A good-natured though some what slow-moving hour beginning with Venezuela's new redistributionist policies (WFB: "Why should a country like yours, that is so abundantly endowed by nature, require (a) foreign investments, and (b) higher domestic taxes?" DA: "Well, we have to cope with a problem that has been accumulating for many years, which has been the social underdevelopment of the country ... An increase of tax is not only are venue-producing decision, but is rather also a way of teaching the Venezuelans how to live in a society in which both sides have to cooperate.") and going on to OPEC and whether the grain-producing countries should try to emulate it.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

"As we sit here," WFB begins,"it is not absolutely known even whether the widow of Mao Tse-tung is alive or dead. Every manner of crime is imputed to her, and it is even whispered that she permitted the music of Beethoven into the death chamber of her husband." What will the incoming Carter Administration do about it all? What should it do? A rich discussion with two men who know as much about this closed society as one can know from the outside; we go from the ouster of Teng Hsiao-ping to what should be our policy on selling technology, and especially weapons technology, to Peking. DZ: "Simon Leys ... reports... [that] a young man in a Chinese department store walked up to a man who was obviously a foreigner and tried to offer him some assistance in the English language. And this young man, who subsequently defected to Hong Kong, told Simon Leys that about twenty minutes after that conversation took place he was brought into the public security station and questioned at great length as to why he was in contact with this Western diplomat, how long he had known him, and so on and so forth.

A lively discussion of the road to democracy, Latin America's relations with the United States, and experiments by other Latin countries, especially the Friedmanites in Chile. JAM: "Let me ask you a question. Where is the borderline ...between being a demagogue and being a democrat? If there is one, and I think there is one, what we are trying to do here is not simply give a so-called voice to the people. Did they really have a voice in Argentina [under Peron]?" WFB: "Well, they certainly understood themselves as having a voice.... That's why I think that when you talk about strengthening democratic institutions by making the government responsive to the voice of the people you need to make a qualification, don't you?" JAM: "I don't think I said 'responsive to the voice of the people.' I think letting the people express themselves through their institutions--that means congress; that means the executive branch; that means the courts of the judiciary system, even the vote itself." ... KF: "A lot of countries ... do feel it [foreign investment] is imperialism.... They feel that they've really got an anchor around their neck.

MD: "We had lived through four years of Nixon as it was, so it really didn't make an awful lot of difference." WFB: "That's right, but those four years of Nixon's showed your GNP going up rather dramatically, didn't it?" MD: "But it showed our prices going up rather dramatically as well, and our unemployment rate beginning to climb too." WFB: "Well, it's true. It's quite true that the inflation which was the principal patrimony of Lyndon Johnson had to be paid somewhere along the line. However, let's not make this a partisan program."

As Mr. Buckley states the problem, paraphrasing Professor Jeffrey Hart of Dartmouth, "Once they were enclaves of distinctiveness, with their traditions, their peculiarities ...That is no longer the case. Once they were fortresses of academic excellence. That is no longer the case." Our guests genially but firmly reject the premise; some things have changed, but don't, Mr. Ward admonishes his host, confuse "Columbia University or perhaps your university at Yale, a very large recipient of federal moneys," with the small private colleges..." "See, about the only money that comes into a place like Amherst College would be through the National Science Foundation for research projects." And Mrs. Conway thinks "there is a growing awareness on the part of women students, and men actually, that there is much to be gained from the small-college environment that is currently not so easily available in a large university setting."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

(When Firing Line invited Mr. Dershowitz to discuss the case, he insisted on bringing Mr. Reems with him; Mr. Buckley intended to pretend Mr. Reems was not there, though good manners eventually got the better of him.) To Mr. Buckley's questions about the effect of pornography on society (does it foster illegitimacy, rape, abortion?), our guests, the one rather more eloquently than the other, offer a slab of First Amendment absolutism. AD: "I think that there have been major changes in the last ten years, brought about by a complex of factors.... For example, Playboy magazine has probably had more of an influence on the sexual revolution than any hard-core porno films.... You would have to ban Playboy magazine. You would probably have to ban Cosmopolitan magazine ... The point is, if you want to achieve the result, then you have to have much more censorship. If you want to have free speech, then you have to include Deep Throat..." WFB: "I think you are right. You have to sort of revitalize a whole central view of man, which is not easily done by the suppression of anything. But the suppression of certain things is an aspect of one's concern. Just as we suppressed the circulation of racist literature in Germany after the war."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

At this moment it seems to be saying that capital punishment is permissible but executions are not." Two old antagonists go around one more time, each unable to change the other's mind, but each clearly laying out the arguments for his side. One sample: EvdH: "It is clear that this penalty is the only one that could restrain people who are already in prison for life and attack their prison mates or officers...." DS: "You know, Ernest, I must violently disagree with you ... There are other ways in prison. Solitary confinement is a very effective deterrent to many, many criminals. And I think--" EvdH: "At the present time, Don, the federal prisons contain a man sentenced to life imprisonment who, since he is in prison, has managed to commit three more murders on three separate occasions. Not unless we chain such a man in a way that was done a hundred years ago, and that you would not approve of, nor would I, I do not think that there is... Because you are giving them immunity in effect by saying, 'Nothing further can happen to you except solitary confinement,' which I don’t think is that much of a punishment." DS: "Oh, it really is, Ernest, I mean--" EvdH: "I have suffered it for two years. I didn't find it that." DS: "Well, you had your own company, Ernest. I mean, very few people are that fortunate in solitary confinement."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

In his book he had examined three cases where protections (of free speech; against unreasonable search and seizure) that supposedly had been won were not granted. In the first and mildest case--which was also the one where there was the least clear and present danger--a schoolteacher who showed up wearing a black armband in mourning for those who had died in the Cambodian incursion was fired. WFB: "In other words, as far as you're concerned, there is no authority over the subject of decorum in a public school." RH: "Right. The courts have said that you can wear your hair any length; you can wear what clothes you want. Now I don't know what you'd do if somebody arrived in public school without any clothes." WFB: "I know what I'd do." RH: "You'd wrap something around them, as we all would."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Parents of some of the young people who had joined the Unification Church had made accusations of brainwashing" and had kidnapped their children to bring them back home. Mr. Salonen is a true believer ("I found that [Moon] was not only a man who lived according to his teachings, but by following those teachings I myself experienced a kind of spiritual rebirth which I had only before read about"). Mr. Kaufman maintains that the Unification Church's official writings contain "redundant expressions of anti-Jewish feeling and anti-Christian feeling," and he is appalled by the church's doctrine against separation of church and state: "If the Reverend Mr. Moon and the Unification Church achieve their goal, this separation, possibly Satanic, will end in this country."

Released on parole, he joined the nascent Black Panther Party and became its Minister of Information. He was involved in a gunfight in which one of his brethren was killed and two policemen were wounded; while out on bail, he ran for President on the Peace and Freedom ticket, appeared on Firing Line (124), and fled the country to avoid being returned to jail. In 1975 he returned home. In his previous appearance on Firing Line (of which we see a short clip here) everyone was a pig, a lackey, or an imperialist. A few years in Cuba, Algeria, and North Korea have taught Mr. Cleaver a lot: They [rulers of countries like Algeria] use their foreign policy as a weapon against their own people. They tell the students and the other people who disagree with the Boumedienne government that 'You can't change things now; you can't rock the boat now or it will jeopardize the rights of the Vietnamese people'; because during the time that the war was going on the Vietnamese had one of their major operations in the Western world [there]... And again, they will tell the Algerian people that 'You can't rock the boat or you will jeopardize the rights of the Palestinian people'; and so they had an open-arms policy for revolutionaries ... and dissidents from other countries."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Does the CIA fulfill such a need? An absorbing three-way debate among a left-wing journalist who answers "No" to both questions, and two right-wingers who answer "Yes" to the first, "Not entirely" to the second. CF: "I hold very little brief for the activities of the CIA in recent years. . . . But Khrushchev's secret speech denouncing Stalin's crimes was uncovered and got out of Russia by the CIA. And if the CIA had not had an agent working on this, it would have remained just another dirty little Russian secret in the Kremlin. As it was, it caused--and is still causing--severe trouble to our potential enemies. That is a positive triumph of American intelligence." SH: "Nothing's as clear-cut as all that, because it turns out that we paid an awful lot of money. We were offering money all over, through every agent we had. Admittedly, we had people we could go to. But I think Yankee dollars brought that as much as CIA ingenuity." WFB: "Ingenuity and Yankee dollars go hand in hand."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Our guests speak calmly, which makes their tale all the more chilling--from the thousands of people who have "disappeared," to the religious persecution that takes place under President Videla (even though he himself appears to be a committed Christian), to Mr. Cox's account of how a journalist deals with terrorism: "He knows he can't possibly afford to have bodyguards; he can't possibly afford to assume that his life is in danger all the time, so he just assumes his life is not in danger. He takes the ordinary precautions that anybody could do. He looks twice or three times before he goes out in the morning; he does things like that. If you get with journalists ..., they say to you, 'You have to realize before you leave in the morning you might not get home at night.' The funny thing is, having realized that, things are all right. It's when you haven't realized that that people get jumpy and get nervous and get worried."

In 1973 he was called back as president; he died the next year and was succeeded by his second wife, Isabel, who ruled for two more disastrous years before she was ousted by the junta led by General Jorge Rafael Videla. This second show from Argentina concentrates on the country's other great problem: inflation. Dr. Martinez de Hoz--whose policies so far were working--fills in the background: during the interregnum inflation had mostly been 20 to 30 per cent--in the danger zone, but not hyperinflation. By the time of last year's coup it had reached 800 per cent. "What we did was to tell the workers straightforwardly the following--and this has been one of my policies all the time: tell everybody the truth all the time, and don't hold anything back. So we explained to the workers, 'Look, if things go on like this, we are heading into massive unemployment with the whole production of the country grinding to a standstill. Now if you want to avoid this, you must accept a policy, a wage policy... and if you'll come along with us, and don't cause trouble, I commit myself to avoid massive unemployment'--which is not easy to do, because generally countries come out of high inflation and recession with massive unemployment."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

To Mr. Hill, "We have grave moral problems in the United States. You know, I'd like to see our people pay attention to making us a better society rather than trying to tell someone else in the Far East, or in Europe, or in the Middle East, or in Africa how to run their affairs." Mr. Roca points out a special difficulty in fighting this kind of terrorist war: "We really make friendship a basic element of our daily life, and these people are using this friendship to introduce into the families of the members of the government- All of the bombs are not put by people disguised as-how do you say mandaderos?" WFB: "Messengers." ER: "Messengers. No, they are disguised as friends of the family, friends of the institution, no? It's difficult to handle all of these questions in the normal manner."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Janitschek, meanwhile-whose organization's members include Olof Palme of Sweden, Willy Brandt of West Germany, and Bruno Kreisky of Austria-is committed passionately to the cause of socialism, but equally passionately to the cause of democracy. A civil but hard-hitting three-cornered battle. WFB: "Jack Jones,... who is the most prominent labor-union leader, I guess, in Great Britain, finds himself 'at home' in East Germany. Do you know why he finds himself at home there?" HJ: "... Maybe he's got personal friends there. As a democratic socialist I don't think that Jack could possibly wish to live in East Germany under a repressive system."... RM: "I think that we should take people at their word. After all, an obscure agitator in Germany, called Hitler, wrote a silly book called Mein Kampf, which the bourgeoisie shrugged off as a silly book which could never be taken seriously, and he proceeded to carry out coldly most of the things that he put down in writing in that book. I think it's likely to prove the same with our left-wing extremists in Britain today."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"Meanwhile, terrorism was escalating in Rhodesia, with recent reports of blacks killing nuns," as Mr. Buckley puts it, "in the name of 'Majority rule now.' " Mrs. Lestor comes out swinging ("I'd like to comment on your introduction, which I thought was a very biased introduction"), and the pace never lets up.

Mr. Crozier: "I think he may be tempted to follow a path ... of considering the strategic relations between the two superpowers in terms of military hardware and of nuclear technology, and of ignoring the other factors at work, including Soviet subversion ... and the Soviet involvement by proxy, the most striking example of which is undoubtedly the Angola affair, in which some 15,000 or perhaps more Cuban troops were there simply to carry out Soviet foreign policy." ... Lord Chalfont: "I think perhaps the greatest reason for concern was the remark which you quoted,... that he proposed to eliminate nuclear weapons from the earth.... Arms control and disarmament is a highly complex business, highly technical, requiring a great deal of intellectual application, a great deal of experience, and quite frankly, anybody who thinks that he's going to eliminate nuclear weapons from the earth in four years or eight years is, I think, living in some kind of fool's paradise."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

We intend to discuss ... why a party that can score almost 50 per cent for a Republican President is reduced nationwide to 12 governorships, 5 state legislatures, 38 and 143 votes, respectively, in the Senate and the House." Those who remember Bob Dole bumbling through the 1996 campaign may be surprised by this lively and productive exchange. One sample: WFB: "Is there a symbolic case to be made for a party that has attempted to assimilate a great scandal and great reverses deciding that the only way it can sort of publicly expiate is by going out of formal existence, even if it reorganizes the same day with the same people under a different banner? ..." RB: "If I had some evidence that by keeping our principles but changing the name we could be a greater force in American politics ... I would accept that.

The results had been hailed in some quarters, deplored in others; Mr. Wagner's book deploring had been described by Mr. Quinn, his department chairman, as "quite the worst he ever wrote." WFB draws out Mr. Quinn on what could be done to rescue the situation: "Well, suppose they didn't give you the authority to govern educational policy in the high schools. Would you then say, 'Well, I'm sorry I didn't have it; under the circumstances I decline to acquiesce in the policy of open enrollment?' Or would you say, I'll do it anyway'?" EQ: "I'll do it anyway." ... GW: "Actually, I never said that I'm against open admission.... I am against what was called open admission." WFB: "Which was what?" GW: "Which was the result of Pied Pipering vast groups of, as he says, underprepared students at the City's expense, including large numbers of foreign students, into a situation in which somewhat anarchic educational results happen."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Birns is convinced that we have since seen, to quote the title of his book, The End of Chilean Democracy; indeed, he maintains that in terms of the brutality and level of repression that now exists in both countries, "I would say that Chile ... is more repressive than Cuba"--prompting Mr. Buckley to catechize Mrs. Ossa on what you can and can't do in Pinochet's Chile. The plus column includes moving freely about the country, leaving the country "with no red tape," criticizing the government, attending church, and "invit[ing] Milton Friedman to go down and lecture and say what he wants to and deplore tyrannical systems ... Can you do that in Cuba? No. Well, how are we doing?" Miss Geyer adds this fascinating bit of background on Salvador Allende, the hero of democracy: "I remember I interviewed [Allende] in '64 .. . And my last question to him was, 'Senator Allende, if you are elected president'--and he wasn't of course, then--but, if you were elected president, how soon would you initiate a one-party state?'

The show has an often startling "You are there" quality, especially in Mr. Buchanan's recollection of the discussion of how to handle the smoking-gun tape and Mr. Nixon's resignation: "We argued for a two-step thing.... It was our argument that the tape should be released first, so that Nixon's own people would realize the reason why he was doing what he was doing." WFB: "So they wouldn't think he just quit?" PJB: "They would come to the conclusion, right, that he had to go. They wouldn't say that ... Nixon's people all broke and they caved in under pressure of the House Judiciary Committee." RR: "...

" PJB: "No, that was very much in the- We discussed it on the helicopter to Camp David; we discussed it at Camp David. Views shifted. Some argued that Nixon should step up on Monday and say, 'I knew this information ... and I'm going to step down.' And we argued against that. We argued we should drop the tape first and let that hit. And one of the reasons, quite frankly, was there were some in the White House and the President's immediate family who felt it was not fatal. So we said, 'Let's drop the tape first. This will demonstrate- We believe it is fatal, and the country-'" RR: "But you didn't say at that time, 'We believe it is fatal.'" PJB: "Oh, yes we did.

(Full-disclosure-wise, WFB had been a member of the Council since 1974.) WFB: "Would it be fair to say that one could, with some confidence, make certain inferences about the political prejudices of the majority of the membership? For instance, you don't concentrate on isolationists, do you?" BAM: "I suppose if you put the question sufficiently broadly it is obvious that most people who are in the Council--indeed I suppose one could say all people who are in the Council--are people who have been elected there because in some way or other they have some professional involvement that in some way engages international affairs ... That can go very far afield, as for example an oceanographer might be a member of the Council."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley, who agrees with his friend Mr. Mahoney on most things, takes Mr. Gottfried's side in this thoughtful discussion of the medical and legal issues. WFB: "Since more people die from smoking cigarettes than from taking heroin, why would it not follow from your reasoning that the smoking of cigarettes ought to be proscribed?" JDM: "Well, among other easy distinctions, I think that there's a marked propensity among heroin users to become addicted, to go out and rob--" WFB: "But only because heroin is expensive, which it wouldn't be if it were legal."

He was soon arrested in a power struggle, and eventually lost his Communist faith and testified in the famous Slansky trial. A rich discussion of the way Communism has played out in Central Europe and the lessons this might hold for the "Eurocommunism" being talked about in France and Italy. EL: "There are two philosophies which could be the basis of the foreign policy. One is a policy of spheres of interest. That is a game the rules of which are far more convenient for a dictatorship. No parliament, no congress, no senate, no press, no Firing Line ... In this respect, America will be always the weaker partner,... will be always on the losing side." ... WFB: "If you want to say, 'Let's play with the notion of Euro communism and let's focus our attentions on Czechoslovakia,' I say I'm all for it.

SS: "I mean a government in which there are free elections--" WFB: "Regular free elections? I mean, Hitler was elected freely." SS: "... But you don't have free elections, in the sense I think we understand it, in Rhodesia right now. Is that an arrangement that you support?" WFB: "No, I don't support it.

But upon the death of Anthony Crosland the new Prime Minister James Callaghan had thrust him into his current post the youngest man to hold it since Anthony Eden in 1935. The most obvious foreign-policy problems for Britain at the moment were Rhodesia (how to speed up the handover of political power to the black majority while recognizing as Dr. Owen phrases is "the kith-and-kin argument ... Many white Rhodesians fought in the war on the side of the Allies inside the British forces." WFB: "Including the Prime Minister." DO: "Yes. And these things go deep and understandably") and detente (where President Carter's animadversions on human rights in the Soviet Union had led President Giscard d'Estaing to say that he had "violated the code of conduct of detente"; (Dr. Owen: "I would challenge anyone to write a 'code of conduct' in how you handle human rights") plus a fascinating little discursion on Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: "he was a decentralized socialist who didn't believe in statism.

He was released and sent into exile in December of 1976. Besides hearing his thoughtful and shrewd analysis on this show, we get to meet a genuine hero of our times. VB: "Well, I remember in the Cold War, I was a member of the Young Pioneer organization, the Communist organization for children, and they forced us to denounce each other for bad behavior, publicly. And it was disgusting. And that was my first, maybe, impulse to reject- I refused to be a member of this organization. It was long ago, really." ...

We get even more of a feel than in her first appearance (Firing Line s0199) of why she would become so admired, and so reviled: "For years now in British politics you have needed to use the word 'consensus.' ... It's a word you didn't use when I first came into politics. We had convictions, and we tried to persuade people that our convictions were the right ones, and it's no earthly good having convictions unless you have the will to translate those convictions into action. I understand that one time you interviewed Mr. Bukovsky. I was very impressed with one of his speeches. He put it marvelously. Back when he lived in Russia, where they had no freedom at all and one or two like him were determined to fight for it whatever it cost, the view he took was not 'Does my voice count?' The view he took was 'If not me, who? If not now, when?' Now that's the view that I want each democrat--and I use it in the ordinary sense, a believer in democracy--to take in Britain.'

A lively hour with these spirited young people. One sample, from Frank Donatelli: "[Andrew Young] has been unable in our judgment to make the transition from Baptist Southern minister/civil-rights leader to world diplomat. There are two very separate and distinct roles. It is fine to hail various excesses in the world from a pulpit, but when you have to deal with political leaders from around the world in very touchy situations, a change of rhetoric is necessary.

Both are more or less conservative; each is popular in his region. In the event, it was Evelle J. Younger who got the nod and was decisively defeated; but for now both would-be challengers concentrate on the problems of the state under "Governor Moonbeam." KM: "I think ...you're going to find that Jerry Brown is extremely vulnerable with the public whether it be the issue of the economy and jobs and the direction the state is going to go economically, whether it be the appointments that he makes to boards and commissions and regulatory bodies ... or just the idea that the people are tired of governing by a mystique rather than by an efficient administration." ... WFB: "If Governor Brown were to rejoin a seminary tomorrow, what would history mark as his primary contribution. . . ?" PW: "Bill, you must be reading my mind.

In a discussion filled with helpful detail, he calls for a comprehensive agreement between Mexico and the United States: "Then we can keep our people in Mexico.... Then the United States can say, 'Fine. If I help you in commerce and in trade, I in turn need energy.' Then we could talk about energy. We could talk about Mexico needing, say,reforms or changes in certain laws like, for instance, Section 602 of your Tax Reform Act of 1976 that limits the amount that can be spent by U.S. persons that go to Mexico on conventions ...

As Mr. Buckley frames the question, "The shibboleth requires that we normalize [relations with the People's Republic of China], and in order to normalize we're supposed to do something abnormal, specifically to rend our diplomatic and military ties with a faithful ally." Mr. Barnett accepts the challenge: "I would say what is abnormal is that for 28 years we have still not fully accepted that the government in Peking is the government of China.... In effect we are compelled by both sides in the ... Chinese civil war, which is not formally ended, to decide which one we regard as the most important." Mr. Elegant poses a ground-clearing question: "I mean, what is the purpose of normalization?" WFB: "Normality." RE: "Normality....

In fact, this is a formal debate sponsored by Columbia College's Debate Council, on the topic "Resolved: That the Welfare System in the United States Should Be Federalized." Unlike the debates organized by Firing Line itself, starting with the famous Panama Canal debate (s0306), most of the participants this evening are undergraduates, with Messrs. Buckley and Moynihan serving as "guest speakers." DPM: "You had the graciousness, sir,... to announce that we would conduct ourselves by the rules of the House of Commons;... [I] recall that it is the practice of the House to address members by their constituencies rather than by their names ... I would like to introduce you to those designations. The first speaker was the member from Reasonableness. The second speaker was the honorable member from Retrogression.

In fact, this is a formal debate sponsored by Columbia College's Debate Council, on the topic "Resolved: That the Welfare System in the United States Should Be Federalized." Unlike the debates organized by Firing Line itself, starting with the famous Panama Canal debate (s0306), most of the participants this evening are undergraduates, with Messrs. Buckley and Moynihan serving as "guest speakers." DPM: "You had the graciousness, sir,... to announce that we would conduct ourselves by the rules of the House of Commons;... [I] recall that it is the practice of the House to address members by their constituencies rather than by their names ... I would like to introduce you to those designations. The first speaker was the member from Reasonableness. The second speaker was the honorable member from Retrogression. The third speaker with great distinction represents the constituency from Common Sense, and then finally you heard from the honorable member from Inequity. I have not the least doubt that he represents his constituents well, and yet I wonder how often he visits them." ...WFB: "Now [Senator Moynihan] addresses you tonight as though he had not written those words [about the "absurdities" in the welfare system] and speaks again using the old rhetoric about the need of the poor to be maintained, of the thirsty to have drink, of the hungry to be fed, and if I may say so, I would like to take whatever credit is due to Ms. Shahmanesh and Mr. Halpem for avoiding that rhetoric inasmuch as we assumed that there was a general consensus on this floor on the need to look after those who are less fortunate than ourselves."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

My commitment to the Constitution rises paramount to every other consideration. It's not that I love segregation; in fact one of the very painful things that I have to confront is that I find myself in bed with people I detest.

"It is important not to confuse opposition against [centralized] planning with a dogmatic laissez-faire attitude.... In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing." ... "If there were omniscient men, if we could know not only all that affects the attainment of our present wishes but also our future wants and desires, there would be little case for liberty. And, in turn, liberty of the individual would, of course, make complete foresight impossible. Liberty is essential in order to leave room for the unforeseeable and unpredictable....

WFB: "Racial discrimination apart, why should there be a black lobby?" VJ: "Apart from discrimination? Discrimination is so much apart of us and of our lives that it cannot be separated so as to make up, Bill, a different aspect of American life.

(As it turned out, the elections were held, but in the context of martial law, and Mr. Marcos's party won handily.) Meanwhile, Mr. Marcos tells us, Filipinos were rethinking their place in the world, in the light both of their own history and of recent developments such as the death of Chairman Mao and the Carter Administration's rumblings about our defense commitments. A perhaps surprisingly rich discussion--embattled heads of state are not always very forthcoming--ranging from the need for the Filipino--especially the Filipino who was educated in Western ways--"to retrace his roots, and retracing his roots, of course, he discovered that he was Asian," to the achievement of Mao Tse-tung ("the unification of the Chinese people, a people divided, isolated, degraded, colonized, a people that was marked as a sleeping giant even by Napoleon"), to the reasons democracy has not thriven in the Philippines ("We tried to get used to it and we--my predecessors--somehow convinced you that we were democratic, but we all knew that this was some kind of a mask which we had put over our face. We were trying to ape you and yet we didn't have the basic requirements--education, distribution of wealth, economic equality, equal opportunity, and the most important, believing in it").

Philippine democracy should be judged according to the condition and the circumstances of our society, not by the demands that we should be like the American society ... The Philippines was one of the only two or three functioning democratic countries in Asia before 1972. We had sixty to seventy years of experience in democracy. All right. There were problems.

By 1977-after Vietnam, after Watergate-the Republican Party had less than half as many registered voters as the Democratic Party had and a comparable disparity in elected officials, but Mrs. Luce, although no less scathing about the current scene, draws a distinction that, in retrospect, seems predictive of Ronald Reagan's success: "Each time the Republicans come in simply as critics and tinkerers and repairmen ... they go out a little weaker. Because what is needed is not only carpenters to repair the holes in the Democratic roof.

But it is irrevocably ours, as much so as Kansas or Nebraska. U.S. Asian policy, on the other hand, is made at the other end of the American world, in Washington. What does that shift in perspective do?" Actually, not much, according to our three guests: in a nuclear world proximity matters much less than it did in 1941. But Admiral Vasey is disturbed by the Carter Administration's "isolationist strategy," and General Weyand takes on the question of canceling our treaty with Taiwan: "Now if you're talking about totally withdrawing our commitment [so] that we'll stand by and watch them seize Taiwan by force and thereby deny or abrogate all of the ideals and values that we have about force being used to conquer or dominate or dictate men's way of life--" WFB: "Wait a minute.

Each principal was to bring two seconds and a military expert; Mr. Bunker was present to answer any technical questions about the treaties. The result was at once a brilliant duel and a model of civilized discourse on an emotional topic. Two samples: WFB: "Well, let me ask you to give me the answer to a question which you cannot document, but in which I permit you to consult only your insight. Would you guess that the Panamanian people would prefer, or not prefer, to exercise sovereignty over their own territory? Take as long as you want to answer that." RR: "I was just sitting here wishing that I had with me the transcript of the impassioned plea that was made to United States senators at a meeting of the Civil Council a week or so ago in Panama.... The speaker was a black-a Panamanian, not an American. His father, a West Indian, worked on the Canal, in building the Canal. The speaker had worked all his life on the Canal, and his impassioned plea was, even though he was a Panamanian, 'Don't! Don't do this! Don't ratify those treaties!' "... WFB: "Do you mean, Would President Carter, as Commander in Chief-" PJB: "And would the Senate support him?" WFB: "-would he assert American rights in the Panama Canal? In my judgment he would. Yes, sir." PJB: "... With regard to South African and Chilean vessels, or vessels going to and from those two pariah countries?" WFB: "We have a guarantee that antedates this treaty to see to it that nondiscriminatory passage is guaranteed. It's the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty." PJB: "Right, but do you think American Marines would go in to guarantee passage to vessels headed for South Africa?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Gordon Liddy had spent 52 months in prison for his role in Watergate, and had applied his tough-minded view of the world to life behind bars. In prison, he tells us, informers are regarded as the lowest of the low. WFB: "If, for instance, you were a member of a terrorist gang, the business of which was, let's say, to kidnap and mutilate systematically, and one day you woke up the beneficiary of a changed view of life, I understand you to be saying that you would not inform on the continuing activities of your former confederates,... and the rape and the murder would continue rather than cause you to act out the role of an informant." GGL: "No. The way you have just stated it would lead someone to believe that... the only alternative to the continued killing and mutilation and so on and so forth would be my turning informer, and that's not so.

EY: "By what particular measure would you apply your instrumental test to foreign policy ... ?" WFB: "I answer that with an ease that you might find both disarming and simplistic.

PG: "What are the calipers that you use at sunrise to determine each day whether the Soviet Union is a little bit up or a little bit behind?"

The "disdainful title" of his book, as WFB reminds us, refers to "a famous observation by Henry Kissinger, then Secretary of State, that he hoped the Paris Accords would provide a decent interval of self-determination for South Vietnam before what would surely be the final chapter in their struggle with the Communists." This absorbing discussion ranges from why Mr. Snepp felt free to release CIA secrets ("Perhaps I was wrong and this is an expression of hubris, but I believe that secrets must be maintained by everybody, and not merely by the lower-ranking officials of the State Department and the CIA"), to the terms of the Paris Accords themselves (FS: "Viewed as a whole they were a sellout--of South Vietnam to the North." WFB: "So Thieu was exactly correct to oppose them?" FS: "Oh, I think so").</p><p> Availability: Not available.

[Marxism-Leninism] is a ragbag. I think one of the great delusions of our generation is to assume that there is such a thing as Marxism-Leninism just because they label it that.

The question before the house is: "How sectarian should a political party be?" To what extent does its success depend on refining its ideological differences with the other party, to what extent on broadening its base? In a conversation ranging from Lincoln to Lenin to Goldwater, Senator Mathias makes the case for inclusiveness. CM: "Going back a little beyond Lenin to Lincoln, Lincoln recruited the Republican Party from a very disparate kind of political scene in which you had abolitionists and you had conservatives. You had all sorts of different American groups that he brought together on the concept of freedom...." WFB: "Now, Lincoln may be a bad guy to start out with because Lincoln was so terribly eclectic and at the same time so terribly expediential...." CM: "Lincoln may be a hard man to start with, but in fact he is the man we started with." WFB: "He was the first Republican President, but he didn't found the Republican Party." CM: "No, but he brought it to power. He showed how it could come to power and how it could perform."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The Allies quickly rallied and drove them back--but not before America had been convinced that we had suffered a serious defeat. Now Peter Braestrup had written a 1,500-page book analyzing the American press's reporting and its effects. An illuminating discussion, from which one sample. Mr. Braestrup: "Adding to the pressures was the terrible fear among the civilians in the White House. You remember that none of these men--including the President--had ever fought in a war on the ground. None of the whiz kids in the Pentagon had ever fought in a war on the ground. They were all defense intellectuals. They saw the big picture, but when the little picture got bloody and smoky, this made them nervous, and it made the President nervous."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Now that he is Secretary of Energy, the bad news is that there is no energy, or at least not enough of it, or more exactly a looming world scarcity of it." This is not another discussion of OPEC, but rather one of what we can do given continued OPEC intransigence. Mr. Schlesinger places more reliance on government manipulation, Mr. Buckley more reliance on the free market, in this informative discussion ranging from why there is so much bad blood between coal miners and mine owners, to how Americans can be persuaded of the virtues of nuclear energy (Mr. Schlesinger was once head of the Atomic Energy Commission), to how we can become less profligate in our use of energy: JS: "Prices have always been low in the United States. Energy has been cheap. The American character is expansive. It has not recognized these limits, the question of finiteness. The only experience that America has had with finiteness was the closing of the frontier."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Mr. Weinstein is there a survivor who was involved with both Hiss and Chambers who, having remained silent, might now under the prodding of your book speak out with the truth?" AW: "I think there are several who could, Mr. Buckley. I would be very surprised if any did.... Although it should be said that it surprised me when some of the people who spoke to me for the book did. For example, in his own memoir, Witness, Whittaker Chambers calls upon a man he mentions only by the name Paul and ... says he's hoping this man will come defend him... -an old, old, friend. Well, Paul did not at the time. He was a Communist. Paul later broke with the Party and was- I prefer not to mention his name now; he enjoys a certain measure of privacy now.

The two old adversaries go at it, as always, with good-humored ferocity. Mr. Galbraith begins by contending that a free market in oil and gas has not existed for some time: "The market has been extensively superseded by planning, and this planning...has been planning not by the Federal Government, not by other units of government, but essentially by the large and powerful enterprises which bring these products to us." Mr. Buckley counters: "It is of course his thesis, now as always, that the market has been superseded-superseded by natural events rather than by synthetic events. He refers to his kinship with reality and reason by contrast with my own with romance and nostalgia. I do remember nostalgically when an agent of the Federal Government reported in 1885 that under no circumstances would any oil ever be discovered in California."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

[since] 1960 I think Britain has given more, not less, attention to material things"), and the relation between taxation and wage increases (with Mr. Healey defending a 98 per cent top tax rate on the grounds that "if you're to get the consent of people with very low living standards not to ... bargain for excessive wages and to settle for moderate increases, then you have to prove to them that other people are subject to similar limitations").</p><p> Availability: Not available.

DC: "It all depends on what our premises about a national consensus are. To many people the victory of the Red Army or Mao Tse-tung's Communist regime in China in 1949 was not the collapse of China, nor, to use the phrase you used rather significantly a moment ago, was it a question of 'we,' the United States, 'lost China.'..." WFB: "But you see, Mr. Caute, in America we have a system in which there are branches of government, and it is the explicit constitutional responsibility of the Congress of the United States to monitor the activities of the Executive. Now, one of the activities of the Executive was to engage in a series of maneuvers in the Far East which, assuming a causal relationship of any sort, resulted in the enslavement by the Communists of the Mainland and in a war in Korea in which a great many Americans were killed."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

He eschewed violence, insisting on other forms of pressure. He pursued Christian principles." But in Western establishment opinion he had fallen from grace by joining (with two other black leaders) in a Provisional Council with Prime Minister Ian Smith, to shepherd Rhodesia through what they hoped would be a peaceful transition. Revolutionaries led by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe were waging guerrilla warfare, "with the explicit goal," as WFB puts it, "of frustrating the national plebiscite and creating an all-black Marxist-oriented state." So why aren't Americans rallying behind the moderates? Bishop Muzorewa gives us a richly detailed account of postwar African political history, including the terms on which, say, Tanganyika and Zambia got their independence, and how that affects their attitudes towards present-day Rhodesia: "Your State Department... I believe is acting ... to appease certain powers in Africa ... [who] have one person they have decided should be the king of Zimbabwe and they are trying to be kingmakers themselves. This started with Dr. Kaunda [President of Zambia], who is personally committed to Mr. Nkomo, and he has mobilized every front-line state, so called, to support him."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Solzhenitsyn, with those great burning eyes, speaks like a prophet. Muggeridge, with his twinkling eyes, speaks like a benevolent grandfather-but the two men wind up saying much the same thing, whether speaking of the City of God or the City of Man. MM: Every courageous man in the West who believes in freedom and equality will have a go at them [the South Africans], because that's very easy. But-" WFB: "Or Chile." MM: "Chile, not quite so easily, because there aren't many black people there, and it's not within the orbit much of the West; but South Africa is the absolutely favorite thing. In order not to have to do or say anything about the Gulag, it's perfect.... I've been reading Spengler in these dark days. Do you ever read it?" WFB: "I've managed to avoid it."

They have jointly and severally appeared many times since as panelists or guest interrogators; it was thought this time to invite them as guests in their own right. They come through splendidly, in a spirited examination of the differences between British and American public-affairs television and political debate (with an account of, among much else, how Enoch Powell had finally broken the barrier of silence against him on British TV), the adversary tradition in debating, and the merits of public speakers from Edmund Burke to Richard Nixon. One sample: WFB: "Are you supposed to memorize your speech [in the House of Commons]?" HMH: "You're supposed to speak impromptu." WFB: "Well, the great orations of Churchill--as a matter of fact, he did memorize them; but a number... For instance, the speeches of Burke were certainly not impromptu, were they?" RE: "He always emptied the House of Commons. He was known as the dinner bell. He was not a successful parliamentary orator. Lord North was the parliamentary genius of his age, which is why he preserved his majority so long in the face of the rebellion in the Americas; and so was Walpole before him. That was a knockabout House of Commons, impromptu style."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Vin had escaped to tell the tale, and although his English is weak, he is a moving witness ("I don't think that what is reported to the world is exaggerated. What is said about the holocaust, the executions, the crimes, starvation, hardship, and sickness, is true, absolutely true"). To the question why are so many people denying the magnitude of the killing, Mr. Cherne points out that some of those who were initially the most skeptical (partly because of "their previous knowledge of the Cambodians as a gentle people; and it seemed inconceivable to them"), once they saw the evidence, "are today the most impressive among those who have assembled the data which make Mr. Vin's story a modest one."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

He is another breed of rare bird as well: a public servant who speaks plain, and pungent, English. A spirited conversation exploring what is the minimal sort of regulation that is needed in the air lanes, why the government shouldn't be granting monopoly routes, and how competition really can work in the airline industry. HK: "In any case, American Airlines, which was one of the leading objectors to deregulation, has now gone all the way over to the other extreme." WFB: "With cut fares and cut rates." HK: "Oh yes. They just say, 'Get out of our way.' I wish I could say that I had been farsighted enough to have planned it so, but there is a general view now among many airline executives that if the CAB is going to be of so little use to us by way of protecting us, then let's get them out of the way.

[either in Europe or in Latin America] and hence his idea was, 'Let's survive by making friends'"), what the election of Albino Luciani as John Paul I portended, and how the conclave that elected him actually proceeded ("And Wyszynski, this Pole whom the Romans have always referred to contemptuously as 'Our Holy Father of Central Europe,' he sort of steamrolls over everybody. Having dealt with Gomulka and Gierek in the Stalinist period in Poland, he's a strong man. He and Wojtyla of Krakow and a man called Josef Hoffner, a strong arrogant German cardinal--I'm sure his arrogance stems from his desire for the Kingdom of God, but that's his reputation--and Ratzinger and then the four Spanish cardinals ...came in and said, 'No way.

One month later, the voters confirmed Governor Kerr's judgments by giving Mr. Fraser's party a landslide victory. Three years later he was in trouble in the polls, at least partly because, although his government had brought down the inflation it had inherited, it had not brought down unemployment. Today's conversation starts slowly, with Mr. Fraser a little inclined to evasion ("I think it's impertinent for me to make a judgment about the kinds of policies the United States ought to pursue." WFB: "We'd be very grateful, because ours aren't working"), but it improves as we go along, covering matters from economics, to Australia's participation in the World Wars and the Vietnam War, to the proper relations with authoritarian regimes such as Argentina's and Chile's. MF: "We're all affected by the world around us--what the United States can do, the physical power of the United States compared to the Soviet Union. Where does the weight of the hundreds of millions of Chinese fit into that particular equation? And Australia is a nation of 14 million people only, and small nations, I think, have to tread their paths with skill."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This rousing session on the place of trade unions and the power of the press never slows down. One sample, on whether generous union settlements and rises in the minimum wage hurt the workers at the lowest end of the scale: RH: "No, I don't think it's true in America, and it's certainly not true in this country. It's a nonsense theory as far as Australia is concerned.... Because under the way in which our arbitration system operates, when the trade-union movement goes in and conducts cases to improve wages or working conditions, the results don't flow simply to members of trade unions. They go to all people who are employed ..." WFB: "You have a remarkable facility for simply co-opting all idealistic objectives and saying that they are served by your policies. Now, is this simply a polemical habit, or are you willing to give an objective basis for it? In point of fact, every time in America there has been a raise in the minimum wage there has been a huge increase in black unemployment. Now what's nonsensical about that?"

Governor Romero rebuts the charges and defends statehood on theoretical grounds: WFB: "You don't think it is possible to improvise on the Commonwealth, so as, for instance, to give you a negative veto on federal legislation as it applies to Puerto Rico ... ?" CRB: "Bill, if you don't understand really what it means to be a U.S. citizen ... then you might be happy with that.

"Every day," Mr. Buckley begins," a fresh victim of one of Mao's purges is exonerated; tomorrow they may disentomb Mozart at the rate they are going . . ." To help us sort it all out, we have one of the English-speaking world's leading journalists, whose China-watching goes back to the decade he spent in China as a young man just out of Harvard. To take just one sample: THW: "They keep coming back to me, these memories of the Saturday-night dances at Communist headquarters in Yenan.... They would go waltzing around and sashaying, and the commander-in-chief, Chu Teh, would sit there with his wife like a grandmother and grandfather seeing a Jewish wedding, and there would be Yeh Chien-ying, who is now the Defense Minister, and Lin Piao, who has been purged and his throat cut, and P'eng Te-huai, who has been purged and is now being resurrected, I am told... To see these men in that lyrical period when they were the underdogs, when they were fighting the Japanese, when they were behind the Japanese lines and risking their lives everyday--to see their comradeship and their brilliance and their camaraderie was to be carried away by it." WFB: "You sound like John Reed." THW: "But John Reed died too soon to see what happened later, to see Stalin knock off Trotsky, and knock off Bukharin and knock off Zinoviev. I have lived to see these comrades in arms ... poisoned with power,shoot each other down, exile each other. It's a terrible thing. ... I think ours is the only revolution in all history where the revolutionaries did not kill each other off." Alternate title: "What Should Be Our Chinese Policy?"</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

However, it was not highly regarded in terms of civil liberties and democracy, and Mr. Lee was less often described in the Western press as "prime minister" than as "strongman." A low-key but absorbing hour with this dominant figure. WFB: "Somebody living in your country, judging the situation today over against the situation ten years ago, would he say, 'Prime Minister Lee gives me grounds for believing that human rights are increasing in Singapore'?" LKY: "I would hope that's the answer you'd get from most of the people in Singapore." WFB: "And what would they point to concretely?" LKY: "Well, what is it they are prevented from exercising?" WFB: "Freedom of the press." LKY: "I think human rights in a Third World situation have more important facets than freedom of the press. There's freedom from hunger, from want, from ignorance, from disease, the right to education of the young, the right to a job, the right to a life free from fear."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This proves to be a calm and extremely informative discussion of a topic that often reaches the shouting stage, ranging over the history of our immigration policies (as WFB puts it, "In 1797 the Congress argued that since the United States was already fully populated and mature, we should not allow any more immigrants") and the effects of the 1965 law. WFB: "Well, as a cultural question, would there be an ugly resentment in Mexico of any artifact that might be created along the border that would sound like sort of a reversed Berlin Wall, not to keep Americans in but to keep foreigners out?" LJC: "Well, we just went through that, where after the Department of Justice and OMB and Congress and everybody had approved, without a dissenting voice or vote, the construction of 12 miles of replacement fence and a little bit of new fence at El Paso and San Diego, the Mexican newspapers reacted as if we had declared war on Mexico."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What comes next? The non-China Hand may sometimes be left behind as our guests wrangle, but we get enough details to keep us going. WFB: "Now what happens [given that there is no longer a defense treaty] with the next Democratic President or with Mr. Carter when he's reborn on the subject of China?" JAC: "But look, this was true even under the defense treaty. What was the defense treaty after all? It was a commitment of mush.

Mr. Vree outlines the reasons for the schism (Sometimes we say to them [conservatives who have remained in the Episcopal Church], 'We go to prepare a place for you.' " Is the break away church a nostalgic splinter group? Not at all, says Bishop Morse: "I would say we are part of an avant-garde movement--I mean, we hope we are in the tradition of the excitement of someone like Pope John Paul II or Solzhenitsyn. There is a great shake out of orthodox Christians taking place, and if you can reach the Episcopalian, who is a very interesting minority in American life, of a certain decision-making class-- . . . if we can excite your Episcopalian with orthodox Christianity, we hope that with this we will begin a renewal of the reunion of Eastern and Western Christendom--Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and Anglicans."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

I think subsequent events-and it would not be difficult to tick them off, ranging from the change of a hundred years' at least crypto-neutrality for Afghanistan; the coup d'etat in Southern Yemen; untended, unchallenged, and illegal Soviet interventionism in Africa ... -all have tended to aggravate the concerns that have been long-standing and which were intensified by the outcome in Vietnam."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Two and a half years later he had left the Party, and Mr. Buckley begins by asking "Whether he was moved finally to leave the Communist Party after reflecting on the cogency of the arguments I posed on this program." JR: "No, not quite, not quite.... I think basically what drove me to the conclusion that the Communist Party ... wasn't relevant was this: that the structures of the Communist Parties are based on pre-revolutionary Russian experience." Speaking of Euro communism, he adds: "They can change programmatically all they want, but if they have plans for a democratic socialist society, they will have to become democratic socialist parties. And once they do that, they cease to be Communist Parties." Before we get back to the crisis of British trade unions, we have dealt with Hitler and Frederick the Great, Albert Schweitzer and Martin Luther King Jr., and what Jesus meant when he chased the money changers from the Temple.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The election was duly held in May, with the Conservatives taking 339 seats, Labour 268, and the Liberals 11, but meanwhile our guests have much to say about trade unions, the true meaning of freedom, and one another. RB: "Every time something is put in practice, it doesn't work and then you say, 'That's not it.' At one time you could say socialism would work because it hadn't been tried anywhere. But everywhere it has been tried it has been chaos. And as a suspicious man, it strikes me it might be chaos everywhere when it is tried." ...

Although Messrs. Rabin and Tamir are on opposite sides of the political fence, this proves to be a good-tempered discussion of the military situation, the relations among the different Arab states, the Palestinian refugees, and the importance of Anwar al-Sadat. ST: "You have noticed that the last decision made by Egypt was uttered from one mouth without the knowledge of anybody else in Egypt. It was a decision of one man, just as his courageous arrival in Jerusalem was the decision of one man. It was a great step, but of course there is permanent with it apprehension about what happens if he is removed politically or otherwise--as does happen in the Middle East so very often, especially in dictatorial countries, the Arab countries." (For the record, Mr. Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mr. Rabin in 1995.)</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Katz is a hardliner who had just broken with his old associate (going back to Irgun days) Menachem Begin. Mr. Avineri has hopes for the treaty, partly because of Sadat's formal statement to the Knesset: "'I am here to tell you that for thirty years we have not accepted you ...

They also shed some fascinating sidelights on, e.g., Middle Eastern corruption. Mr. Bushinsky: "You have kind of a disguised unemployment in a country like Egypt, where many people are kept working and salaried by dint of their presumed jobs, and you as an individual, foreign or domestic, must go through these people--and they are very jealous of their prerogatives; otherwise their jobs might be rendered redundant. You can call that a form of corruption if you will, but... it wasn't necessary to bribe the air-freight personnel to get your shipment out... Maybe there were a few too many rubber stamps along the way, but not corruption on a scale that John had known in Tehran."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One sample: WFB: "The fundamentalist-" PJV: "Excuse me, I refuse to use the term fundamentalist for Islam. That is a very Christian, canonical, theological proposition. There's no such thing as fundamentalism in Islam. There is orthodox in Islam." WFB: "There is such a thing as a metaphor everywhere." PJV: "All right. Thank you.

Mr. Buckley begins by reminding Mr. Adelman that back in 1973 he had said--on Firing Line, among other places (s0108)--that we had "nothing to fear from the cartelization of oil by the OPEC powers." Mr. Adelman had come up with an ingenious-sounding plan to entice more oil out of the world market; Mr. Spriggs seriously doubts whether it would work.

Professor Beyea explains "the difference between a technological pessimist and a technological optimist.... When it comes down to it, I run scared about a technological device. I cannot guarantee a technological device until I've tested it many times in full scale. Nuclear power we can never test in full scale, and that disturbs me."

Few people remembered that he had been acquitted in court and had been pronounced blameless by the Society of Certified Public Accountants. WFB leads his guest to talk--as he does often movingly and with an amazing lack of bitterness--about his "own efforts to work your way back into the high esteem of the community," about campaign finance in general, and about Watergate in particular. WFB: "The seeds of the hurricane were planted by Nixon." MS: "The seeds of the hurricane go right back to the one incident in the Watergate, a petty burglary, which then was allowed by Nixon and his people to become a cause celebre." WFB: "But it was a justifiable cause celebre, wasn't it?" MS: "Unquestionably, and believe me, I'm not an apologist for Richard Nixon. I don't defend what he did. . . . What I say is that in the search for the guilty there were hundreds of innocent people who were swept into that dragnet and had to prove their innocence, that it was a witch-hunt type of operation that should never again happen in this country."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What must come, what surely will come ... is euthanasia." The conversation with this favorite Firing Line guest ranges from abortion to St. Augustine's City of God. One sample from Mr. Muggeridge: "The earthly city of St. Augustine is a grubby place, but once you see the City of God, its grubbiness somehow seems much less, much more bearable, because you know that every single thing in it, even the grubbiness, is related to this other City of God."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

As today's show was being taped, Pope John Paul II was in the midst of his historic visit to his native Poland. A detail-filled conversation ranging from the election of Karol Wojtyla to, as WFB puts it, "the ritual excommunication of Daniel Patrick Moynihan" by the New York Times (for coming out in favor of aid to private schools), from the tangible effects of prayer on the psyche to the fact that, as Father Greeley puts it, "anti-Catholicism is as American as blueberry pie." Father Greeley on the papal election: "I think the first thing [the cardinals] thought about was a reward to Poland for its strong faith in the face of Communist persecution. The second thing that occurred to them is here was a man who knew how to deal with Communism. He knew how to deal with it intellectually, because he was a philosopher and he understood Marxist philosophy. He sometimes amused himself by arguing with Party members about Marx, whom they hadn't read and he had. But also because he understood it politically."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On this radiant show she has with her both a harpsichord and a piano to illustrate her points about how ornamentation was annotated up until the 18th century, how Bach was mistreated in the 19th century, and how different the same piece of music sounds in different tempi. WFB: "Does what you say add up to an excuse not to do the repetitions in the 20th century, which would have fitted the mood of the 18th century?" RT: "Yes, that's an interesting point, because we think of the so-called 'repeats' as repetitions.... A repeat is something quite different from what we think of as repetition.

There had now been elections--of which Mr. Lowenstein had been an observer, and Mr. Solarz had declined to be an observer--in which blacks were allowed full participation (see the Firing Line with Bishop Muzorewa, s0331), but President Carter had announced that the sanctions would continue against the country that its white rulers still called Rhodesia but the black majority called Zimbabwe. Although both guests want, as Mr. Lowenstein puts it, "a democratic government which would not be racist in its composition and which would be achieved with the least bloodshed possible," they disagree, often heatedly, on the best means to that end.

In this first in a series of conversations with potential candidates, Senator Dole is impressive, as he had been in his first Firing Line appearance (s0276)--this time on subjects ranging from Food Stamps to SALT II to inflation. RD: "I must say that we're in a much different position now than we would have been if Ford had been elected, because we probably would have gone ahead with the B-l bomber; we wouldn't have held back on the MX for two and a half years, then suddenly said, 'Well, we think we're going to do it but we don't know about the basing system yet,' so it's still a non-decision as far as Carter's concerned; we wouldn't have had the hanky-panky with the neutron bomb; we wouldn't have let Iran go down the tube ... There's no question about it: President Carter is perceived to be very weak in foreign policy."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

(Note: When decontrol went into effect, the oil crisis quickly dissipated.) HM: "I'm sure you saw the story the other day where Mr. Schlesinger fears to prod the oil firms. Now isn't that unbelievable that the head of the Department of Energy is afraid of the oil companies?" WFB: "No, not at all. The White House is afraid of the New York Times." HM: "What about Bill Buckley. Are they afraid of him, too?" WFB: "No. However, I have certain rights that the government can't take away from me.

Solid, substantive discussion of inflation and the size of government. JW: "The President of the United States inaugurates an anti-inflation program. He puts no inhibition on profits, he puts no inhibition on interest, there's no inhibition on anything that makes the rich and wealthy richer and wealthier. And he says, 'You working people will take 7 per cent and no more, otherwise we'll use all of the apparent and unapparent power of this government.' So the president of General Motors comes to Washington and he says the program is excellent, goes back to Detroit, raises the price of automobiles, and nothing happens to him.

Whether it was a fast one or not, General Seignious was indeed selling SALT II, not as an end in itself but as a step along the way: "I would like to see us get into very deep reductions and particularly in warheads, because those are the things that kill people and kill cities and kill cultures and kill our way of life." The discussion is highly technical, but both host and guest give us plenty of detail to bring us along, whether on the different sorts of missiles, on the parallels or lack of them between Hitler at Munich and the current treaty, or on the advantages and disadvantages to an anti-ballistic-missile system.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

That is, in real life one occasionally finds a businessman who's not plotting to murder his go-go dancer girlfriend.")

As WFB introduces today's guest, "To the surprise of many Americans, there is a candidate for the Republican nomination for President who is not, so to speak, a Goldwater conservative." Rep. Anderson proceeds to live up to this billing--e.g., on the "segment of the Republican right wing that is so hung up on things like abortion, things like busing, things like the Panama Canal... the so-called 'hot button' issues.... I don't believe, despite their outcry, that they are really large enough to be the swing factor in determining either the nomination or the election. Thereby, of course, hangs the tale. If I'm wrong in that, then I could become one more in a long line of former candidates." And the rest is history.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "It's one thing to account for the fears of people who are governed by superstition, because there's very little that can be done about that, but how do you account for the fear of intelligent people in your own profession who feel that one has to turn one's back categorically on nuclear energy?" ET: "There is a very simple answer to that. All of us are governed by superstition. Intelligence is a rare, singular, perhaps pathological phenomenon. Intelligence is an abnormality. Now people can be intelligent in their own narrow field--and you mentioned that. People who really know about nuclear reactors are almost to a man people who have full confidence. We have an association--Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy. We have a big membership. Of course, Linus Pauling does not belong.

A high point of the show: Mrs. Sagan's account of how, as a young woman in Italy during World War II, she reconciled her pacifism with her desire to take part in the Resistance: "I chose to fight but in a different way than using a gun. ... I chose to join ... a larger group of people who ... smuggle[d] people to Switzerland. If you are caught-- Oh, I did something else. I poured sand in engines, so that when the Gestapo was going to get people, the cars wouldn't run. Or, on trains.

EFH: "Can we say why those troops are in Cuba, and how they're there and what's going on?" WFB: "I wish you would." EFH: "Well, I know you've got to give Secretary Kissinger credit for this one. During his time in the Administration there were suggestions from the National Security Council that we cut out the intelligence overflights--they were too expensive, all we needed to do was send satellites. Henry Kissinger said no, that would be a wrong signal, absolutely wrong. He said if you stop the overflights they'll start taking advantage.

The author of Economists at Bay and The Age of Keynes proceeds in the most genial way to demonstrate the truth of that description: "I would concentrate on the acquisition of wealth even more than the taxation of income.

Mr. Steinfels and Father O'Hare both hold that, as Father O'Hare expresses it, "[The Pope] did not speak primarily as an economic expert. He spoke primarily as a moral teacher,... insisting again and again that we should not lose sight of the primacy of the human person in any social, economic, or political system." But to Mr. Steinfels's assertion that "it is a mistake to separate the human-rights concerns of the Pope from the material or economic rights," because the different sorts of rights are "interlaced," Mr. Buckley maintains that "if you don't have economic freedom you don't have many other freedoms."

This new novel-on the life and death of Gary Gilmore, the murderer who demanded to be executed by the State of Utah-was widely heralded as a masterpiece, and the writing of it had led Mr. Mailer to contemplate life, death, and literature. "I began to feel that I had to change some of my ideas about what literature should consist of. I've always leaned on the side that literature finally is a guide, that it explains complex matters to us, it gives us a deeper understanding of our existence. And I felt that maybe the time had come, at least for me in my own work, to do a book where I don't explain it to the reader." ... "I wanted the reader to live with this incredible complexity that's involved in not just the process of execution, but with that most mysterious fact that we live and then we die."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

As WFB puts it in his introduction: "New York City is both unique--there is only one New York; we could hardly afford more--and representative: representative of the problems of many large American cities. . .. But, even as it surpasses them all in medical research, in opera and ballet, in public libraries and museums, New York City is the largest headache of the mall." Mayor Koch had been in the saddle for almost two years by this point, and "he is controversial--and ubiquitous--and has restored great liveliness to his office." Which liveliness he brings to this show, whether defending the Federal Government's loan guarantees to New York or explaining how he gets to know his people: "I go around the City three days a week. I go on the weekends without reporters, without television cameras, because if you have a reporter or television camera the person you are talking to is no longer a person. He or she is an actor."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Not as rich in detail as one would hope from a literary scholar, but still a good exploration of the modern university scene. WFB: "I am asking you to what extent do you feel encumbered at this moment as the result of the government's playing a role which one of your predecessors, Charles Seymour, conceived of as intolerable. Now you say, 'Well, hell, they're paying for medical research and they're helping with student loans, so what?' " ABG: "No, I don't remember saying, 'So what?' " WFB: "Not quite 'So what?'; but it sounded a little bit so-what-ish. Question: Are they nipping at your heels?" ABG: "Constantly. And so are a lot of other people, but that's all right." WFB: "They have greater sanctions, I suppose." ABG: "To the extent that one is properly accountable for the public's money, one therefore has to account for it."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Breitenfeld: I find those who call us elite implying directly that there is somebody out there due to race, heritage, wealth, social standing, education, and intelligence who is unable or unwilling to enjoy what we have to offer.

S. Eliot, whom all of them considered a great poet, because Eliot was a reactionary in his political views, and also because he was a modernist in his technique, and modernism was regarded as a form of bourgeois degeneracy by the Party. "In Mr. Podhoretz's case, he was first struck by the fact that the "Free Speech" Movement at Berkeley "began shouting down speakers who were in disagreement with its views." He and WFB begin with Lionel Trilling and the Sixties wars at Columbia, and go on to the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the battle against affirmative-action quotas.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

JJ: "I think that what we're talking about is exercising your freedoms in such a way that assures somebody else's freedoms.... And if you're talking about the whole capability of an institution to provide equity, and in this instance sex equity, and... at this point HEW is defining your scholarships as federal money, this is certainly the only way that Congress can influence education." GCR: "But you see, the question here isn't really influencing education in the sense of correcting an inequity. As I say, in four years of constant correspondence and all sorts of litigation there has never been a moment when HEW even alleged that there was an inequity. The issue here, and their insistence, is entirely a matter of control of our campus."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

We know now how to give the individual consumer the widest choice of programming; we can reach an individual television set via satellite in Santa Barbara, California, and see what the resident of Atlanta, Georgia, is seeing, assuming that this is something you want to see." Mr. Ferris's dual background makes him well qualified to discuss the legal and social implications of all of this, which he does with verve: "We're making decisions today at the FCC that I think are determining to a great extent the basic infrastructure of the information of the society of the 21st century, and it bothers me that more people are not paying attention to what we are doing.... We are determining to a great extent what it is we are going to carry from the 20th century into the 21st about the Bill of Rights, about the sense of privacy, about what are the things about our society that we really cherish, that could be infringed by the [new cable and satellite] technology unless some thought is given to it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As Mr. Buckley introduces him, "If he achieves the nomination, he will have done so against the heaviest odds since Jimmy Carter won the nomination, and George McGovern. Which is another way of saying that nobody, but nobody, is counted out in these volatile days, including Philip Miller Crane." Rep. Crane is the third Republican hopeful we have met in this election cycle (after Bob Dole and John Anderson), and WFB puts him smartly through his paces on topics ranging from the labor vote at home to the hostage crisis in Iran to the ongoing oil crisis. PC: "There are literally thousands and thousands of capped wells in the United States, and the reason why is because we've told Americans they can only get $5.90 a barrel for their oil when we're saying that if you're an Arab and a member of the oligopoly or if you're Nigerian or Venezuelan, we're willing to pay $26 a barrel or $35 a barrel or $50 a barrel."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

RR: "Well, I would be inclined to say that that was a problem for the local authorities in Detroit, unless those local authorities were unable to control the situation...." A discussion full of substance-on topics ranging from Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, to the way government bonds should be issued, to the still-ongoing energy crisis, to the still-high unemployment-but also a delicious dress rehearsal: WFB: "Mr. President, the CIA has complained to you that it cannot discharge some of the recent directives that the National Security Council has given it as a result of its having been hamstrung by a number of provisions insisted on by Senator Church three or four years ago. How would you handle that dilemma?" RR: "Why, I'm surprised that they're complaining, because one of the first things I did when I took office was ask Congress to repeal those restrictions that were put on by Senator Church."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Despite the gloominess of the message, this proves to be a lively exchange. PD: ".. . I'm worried about oil. Let 'em have Grenada. You have to have a strategic sense of balance here. The whole of the Caribbean isn't worth much to us. It can be easily neutralized in any time of crisis." RS: "Except that Grenada's 90 miles from Venezuela." PD: "But oil from the Middle East is immediately and crucially important to the whole of Western Europe and Japan." WFB: "Is Mr. Staar's point--and your point too--that if we control the skies over the Caribbean and the water in the Caribbean, whoever has the atolls doesn't matter all that much? ..."

Mr. Ennis takes the activist view; "Mr. Bork holds that this Court and the Warren Court, and indeed prior Courts, have made up the Constitution in large part." ... BE: "The abortion cases are certainly examples of judicial activism. The question is whether it is impermissible judicial activism ... In the abortion cases ... it is harder to see that than in some other area, for two reasons. One reason is that it involves women, who are not a discrete and insular minority totally excluded from the political process... and the other is that the constitutional principle the Supreme Court was relying on ... was the principle of privacy,. . .

Topics range from a potential Nuremberg-style trial of the Shah of Iran, to whether it would be a disaster for conservatives if George Bush rather than Ronald Reagan received the GOP nomination, to women and the draft, to Ted Kennedy's challenging President Carter in the primaries. One sample: JK: "If you make a distinction between empirical differences on the one hand and principled differences on the other, isn't it true that the principled differences are far more divisive in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party?" WFB: "Yes. Yes." NvH: "Right. But not betwixt a Carter and a Kennedy." WFB: "I disagree." RN: "I disagree with that also. Just following up what Joe said, I do believe that Kennedy is very comfortable with the idea of an all-controlling Federal Government... Someone asked him just this week, in a private conversation, how are you, in the Kennedy tradition, calling for sacrifice--asking what you can do for your country--when you're even against registration for the draft? And he said, 'I am for sacrifice. I want the American businessman to sacrifice his profits and to reduce his profits.' "</p><p> Availability: Not available.

DD: "They are highly active and they are visible, quite visible, and some of the atrocities they have committed--they're the kind of thing I don't want to mention on public television.

This conversation is sometimes difficult for the non-philosopher, but Mr. Adler has the gift of choosing illustrations to bring us along. MJA: "Kant made a simple mistake.... He said that a hundred dollars in my pocket is not greater than a hundred dollars in my mind. I think that's just nonsense. A hundred dollars in my pocket will do things that a hundred dollars in my mind will not do. I understand the error that he made. Existence is not an ordinary predicate, not an ordinary absolute. It's not like red or green or large or heavy or here or there. And he therefore thought that existence is not a characterizing term. But to say that that which exists in reality does not have more existence and more power than that which exists only in the mind is nonsense."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This rich discussion ranges from the state of British democracy to the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro, from Salvador Allende to Adolf Hitler. Here is Mr. Powers, on Richard Helms's testimony in Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on his appointment as Ambassador to Iran: "Mr. Helms ... was asked if the CIA had been involved in attempting to prevent Salvador Allende from coming to power. He said, 'No.' The answer is 'Yes.' Having said that, you've only just begun to open up the question, really." WFB: ".. . As a matter of fact, I wrote a novel in which I face the same kind of situation in the last chapter, in which my particular guy cops out, so to speak, by simply declining to answer. I assume you'd have preferred if he had done that." TMP: "Well, there were a number of ways that he could have declined to answer or avoided an answer or given not quite such an absolute and clear and wrong answer; and I think he chose not to do any of those things because the net effect... would have let the cat out of the bag, and his whole purpose was not to let the cat out of the bag."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

It was Mr. Reyes who had first reported the arrival of a new Soviet brigade in Cuba, which Mr. Buckley and Senator Ernest Hollings discussed on Firing Line a few months before this show (s0385). JW: "If we do not confront the enemy in Guatemala, for example,... if we do not construct the barrier that Solzhenitsyn spoke of recently, if we fail to do that in Guatemala, then the battle will be fought not in Guatemala, but in a matter of time on our own shores.

BM: "I think as the recession deepens, which I expect it will, there will then be ample opportunity for tax cuts, which I think will have to be done not in the old way of stimulating consumption, but in a newer way of stimulating research and development, investment, and the things we've been talking about--and that may be the way that we start putting some of these things together and move in the direction of these supply incentives."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Davidson, whose organization was pressing for a constitutional convention to pass a balanced-budget amendment, engages Messrs. Buckley and van den Haag in a lively discussion of specific initiatives and of the more general question of representative versus plebiscitary democracy. Here is Mr. Davidson's metaphor for why the Federal Government overspends: Assume that everybody in this room, including those in the audience, all shared the same Master Charge card... . And, say, if there were 100 people,... at the end of each billing period we'd all have to pay l/100th of the amount that we ran up on the card. And so we might all say to one another, 'Well, wow, the bill could be fantastic. We might all go bankrupt.'... But the question is, Is it rational for anybody not to spend? And the answer is no, because you get 100 per cent of the benefit that you spend, and you pay 1/100th of the bill that you rack up. So the person who acts responsibly and says, 'No, I won't spend,' is the guy who's going to end up paying for other people's expenditures alone and not get anything himself."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Green downplays the left wingishness of the effort ("As for the socialist point, Mr. Buckley, the predicate of every book that I've worked on ... is market economy. It's more competition; it's more small business"); the discussion sometimes reaches the shouting stage as Messrs. Buckley and Bleiberg engage Mr. Green on the subject of regulation of all sorts, from the SEC to the FDA to the EPA.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Specifically, on the conflict between traditionalists (like Messrs. Buckley and Davies) who loved the Tridentine Mass, and reformers (like Monsignor Champlin) who support the Novus Ordo mandated by Vatican II. JC: "You liked the old worship because the 'I' was able to pray, and you weren't kind of impinged by the priest or other people? That kind of notion? ..." WFB: "It gave me a sense that the priest was there as a mediator between me and God, whereas it seems to me that the existing approach tends to be sort of crowd-oriented." JC: "I think that's the key thing right there.... Before Vatican II, when I was ordained in '56, the Mass was very much a mystery. I was a priest with my back to the people, in Latin, there was silence in the congregation.... The Council, then, going back to the best traditions of the early Church, said it's both 'I' and 'we' together. It's a vertical worship, yes, but it's also a horizontal worship."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The program--the first such retrospective on Firing Line (others would be done for Clare Boothe Luce, Michael Harrington, Malcolm Muggeridge, and Barry Goldwater)--is composed of excerpts from Mr. Lowenstein's nine Firing Line appearances, framed by the eulogies given at his memorial service by Mr. Buckley and Senator Edward Kennedy. EMK: "He was a person of impassioned political conviction, but personally he loved so many who so often disagreed with his politics. Who but Al Lowenstein could claim among his best friends both Bill Buckley and Robert Kennedy?" WFB: "Of all the partisans I have known, from the furthest steppes of the spectrum, his was the most undistracted concern, not for humanity--though he was conversant with big-think idiom--but for human beings."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

This riveting discussion focuses on the way the Soviet Bloc conducts disinformation campaigns, with the witting or unwitting assistance of the Western media. Mr. de Borchgrave: "According to what we've heard from defectors--and we've had access to most defectors from the KGB, the GRU (which is Soviet military intelligence), the Cuban DGI, and other Eastern secret services--to a man (because there isn't a woman among them), they all say the same thing: they have successfully over the years anaesthetized Western opinion-makers and Western governments as to their real intentions." Mr. Moss: "The KGB is ... the largest, most ruthless secret service in the world, with over a million employees, and it's bent on our destruction. Yet we can read very little about it, so when we discuss intelligence in our open society, I often have the feeling that we are watching, let us say, a football match in which only one of the teams is showing. The other team has been magically removed from the screen, so we see the remaining team jumping about, striking absurd postures, kicking, pursuing a ball, all inexplicably."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Goldschmidt gives the impression of seeing transportation steadily and seeing it whole, from private automobiles to airlines to long-distance railways to urban mass transit. Mr. Buckley draws the discussion usefully to questions about the price mechanism and the way oil prices affect our relations with our allies. NG: "But there is a flip side to this ... and that is, we have a responsibility not to surprise our allies. We are asking, for example, from the Japanese a pretty severe price for their partnership with us in terms of the Middle East. Their dependence on oil is much greater than ours. We get half of ours here. They get all of theirs someplace else than at home."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Now, Roosevelt and Eisenhower used their Cabinets extensively. Kennedy did not; it bored him to tears. Lyndon Johnson hardly knew the names of his Cabinet members.... And historians seem to be saying that the growth of the Executive is such as to incline a President to deal with his associates--with the people who are right around him--rather than with the people who are, however ostentatious their responsibilities, one step removed." ...JHW: "Many years ago ...

PJB: "I see your argument very clearly. It's an argument that's been made against the Ford idea, which is that it is sort of going back to the past, and Reagan represents a clear break, something new....Whom would you list if you had to list the four or five that Paul mentioned?" WFB:"... It seems to me that Bush is, in virtue of a kind of earned seniority, the obvious candidate, even as Kefauver was the obvious candidate in 1956 to go with Stevenson."

Messrs. Buckley and Chancellor are the co-hosts of the first annual American Book Awards, the successor (not uncontroversially--see the following show, s0421) to the National Book Awards. This show reproduces excerpts from the awards ceremony, with just a short foreword and afterword from Mr. Buckley. One sample, from Theodore White: "I come to present the award for the most unforgiving of all literary arts, the art of autobiography. A young novelist, a young poet, a young raconteur, can hope to do better in his second, third, or fourth time around as he improves his style, but the autobiographer must get it right the first time.

Now the real function, to me, of a literary award--as opposed to something that has to do with the publishing industry--is to discover merit, and to discover merit in books that have not had a commercial success." ... OD: "I think we are trying to compare the TABA awards with the National Book Awards. They are two different events. The National Book Awards is a concept supported by the authors and critics...perfectly valid; I hope it continues in some way. The TABA book awards is a new concept supported by the book community."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It was rather interesting sitting in Governor Reagan's suite and watching various people on the floor of the convention telling us what was happening." ... LG: "Quite apart from the human tragedy of these lost and stunted lives [in the inner cities] is a very significant social dilemma because the working of the complex American society depends upon harmony among all the parts, and the explosions in Miami and the past explosions in other cities are the worst possible grit in the gears of the American system.

The GOP had as recently as the 1976 platform backed the Equal Rights Amendment; this year the platform committee withdrew that plank, over the opposition of Rep. Heckler. This sizzling exchange sometimes reaches the boiling point, but there is also serious discussion of current laws, of working conditions for women, and of the amendment itself. WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Mrs. Heckler whether the statement I have just quoted [from her] doesn't suggest that Mrs. Schlafly, who opposes ERA, also opposes women's rights." MH: "I would have to ask Mrs. Schlafly to speak for herself on the position on women's rights, but I think that those of us who see the amendment as the only vehicle are aware of the fact--as I am, as a member of Congress for 14 years-- that the case-by-case method of dealing with changing the law will simply take another two hundred years...." PS: "I brought along with me a Republican platform that I support and Ronald Reagan supports and which Mrs. Heckler does not support, and I think there's one sentence that... explains the difference between her position and mine. The platform says, 'We support equal rights and equal opportunities for women without taking away traditional rights of women such as exemption from the military draft.' Now I think that one sentence shows who's really for women's rights."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This show offers a thoughtful discussion of a highly emotional problem with, as WFB puts it, "two men who are devoted friends of Israel but who can talk about the subject without shouting." The specific point at issue was Menachem Begin's intransigence over West Bank settlements, but, as Mr. Perlmutter points out, Begin's behavior, and indeed the whole Middle Eastern scene, has to be viewed in the world context: "In the last analysis--God forgive me for this--I really think the Jews are irrelevant, I think the Arabs are irrelevant, I think the settlements are irrelevant, I think the homeland is irrelevant.... It's the United States and the Soviet Union, as primitive as a High Noon movie, walking down that street."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Dr. Rosenthal: "Studies that Phoenix did in New York were showing that... anywhere from 30 to 70 per cent of high-school students were getting stoned three to five times a week. If that kind of regular drunkenness or regular self-medication goes on, I think that it interferes with the kind of maturing process that needs to go on, and we see many youngsters--by no means all, but we can't argue this issue by looking at best outcomes ... --fall apart and regress toward infantilism." Mr. Novak: "I believe that marijuana, like alcohol, should be legal for adults; I believe it should be illegal for kids. I don't think that will stop the problem. I'm not naive. Kids drink. Kids are going to smoke whether it's legal or illegal....Marijuana [is] a weed. It grows easily and in some parts of the country it grows very successfully.

Is Jimmy Carter far gone in narcissism? Are Democratic delegates suffering from creeping economic illiteracy?" This spirited conversation, which treats of both the substance and the strategy, holds up well in retrospect. Mr. Kondracke: "I think that Carter got himself positioned in the political middle in this convention by being booed over the draft registration, by having Teddy Kennedy force down his throat an economic plank that he didn't agree with, and by having militance on the issue of ERA and abortion force things into the platform that he didn't want. He makes himself seem to be the responsible middle beset by the liberals on the left and the right wing represented by Reagan. So, I think he comes out of this convention in much better shape than he went in." ... Mr. Kaiser: "I think that Reagan has this disarming ability to make people feel that he is a regular guy and a plausible guy, which is going to make it hard for the strategy that Michael well describes to take hold. My sense of it is that the election is going to be won by whichever of these characters succeeds in making the other one the issue, and at the moment I think Reagan's got the advantage. But it's his to lose."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Senator Moynihan had just, at the Democratic Convention, spoken approvingly of President Carter's defense policies--to, as WFB puts it, "my stupefaction and that of others." Today's discussion ranges from the bloodbath in Cambodia at the hands of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, to the Soviets' use of Cuban troops as proxies in Africa, to the theory of Mutual Assured Destruction. DPM: "We thought the Russians would build up to our level [in nuclear weapons] 'parity' and then stop, because we thought they had the same view we had. It turned out they didn't.

A ding-dong battle from start to finish: JJB: "In 1977 [Washington, D.C.]put across in the city council the toughest gun-control laws in the country.... The result has been a 26 per cent reduction in homicides by handguns and 22 1/2 per cent in assaults by handguns ... despite the fact that that is just the city, an island surrounded by gun-toting Virginia and Maryland ..." HBC: "... The evaluations of people who in no sense can ever be accused of being friends of ours, the Washington Post and the Washington Star, and another who are friends of ours, the Washington Police Department, do not agree with what Sheriff Buckley just said.

Mrs. Thatcher intended to break that chain, and part of Sir Keith's mandate was to denationalize as many industries as he could. This fast-moving and detail-filled conversation touches on the difficulties of getting from here to there, on the economics of the Concorde, on the effect of Britain's having craft unions (as opposed, say, to the industry-wide unions of West Germany). One sample: KJ: "Our biggest problems come in the public sector, and there are big problems. You are lucky in America. You don't have-- Would you like to have our nationalized sector? Would you like to copy that? I do recommend you not hasten to nationalize." WFB: "No, somewhere along the line the seductiveness of nationalization passed America by. The last time a significant historical figure called for broad scale nationalization was in 1948, and Henry Wallace got about three million votes." KJ: "Yes." WFB: "We go in for a thing called regulation, and regulation is a way of nationalizing without having to preoccupy yourself with a balance sheet."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

During the decades since their undergraduate encounter, Mr. Benn has remained as committed to socialism as Mr. Buckley has to a libertarian brand of conservatism. TB: "Why are people poor in the first place? Why do the people who create the wealth end up poor and the people who own the land end up rich? Now that is the basic socialist position...." WFB: "Why, by current standards, were 90 per cent of the American people poor in 1900, whereas only 9 per cent of them are poor today? Because there has been a universal increase [in the] gross national product which has been made possible by the economic exertions of free men--not men dictated to by the government."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

JBK: "The important thing here is that the emotions, aspirations, that are excited in Muslim breasts, either by the preaching of Islam or by the doctrines of Marxism which are fed to them through different agencies and perhaps in very changed versions--it is not necessary that these two should mix.

Mr. Muggeridge on how he was drawn to faith: "Now why did this longing for faith assail me? Insofar as I can point to anything, it is to do with this profession which both you and I followed of observing what's going on in the world and attempting to report and comment thereon, because that particular occupation gives one a very heightened sense of the sheer fantasy of human affairs--the sheer fantasy of power and of the structures that men construct out of power--and therefore gives one an intense, overwhelming longing to be in contact with reality. And so you look for reality, and you try this and try that, and ultimately you arrive at the conclusion--great oversimplification--that reality is a mystery. The heart of reality is a mystery." WFB: "Even if that were so, why should that mystery lead you to Christian belief?" MM: "Because it leads you to God." NOTE: S0432 is the original 60-minute broadcast.

MM: "I've, believe it or not, longed to be a Catholic.... I've longed for it as though it were the most marvelous thing ... The truth is, I think, that I take a very pessimistic view of the Catholic Church, despite the very brilliant Pope you've now got. It seems to me that it's dropping to pieces; and of course it had a severe blow after the Vatican Council. Therefore, I would be joining something of which I was enormously critical, and this isn't really an honorable thing to do." WFB: "That's never bothered you before." MM: "I've never contemplated anything so serious as joining a church. I mean, even if you were to turn to mundane things-joining a club-if you were to join it quite confident that you were going to challenge all its rules and have rows with all its members, it would be rather a foolish step to take...." WFB: "Well, I'm, to put it lightly, stupefied that you would make a decision whether or not to extend your loyalty to an institution based on the behavior of some of its communicants. I can't imagine any time in history when anybody would have become a Catholic if he had been so easily put off."

The tax burden is the total spending by government, because it's either going to come out as direct taxes on all of us, or it's going to come out through inflation, which is the most insidious tax of all."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Is that correct?" PEA: "You see, that's a complicated thing you are saying and we are more simple than this. We see the people suffering in their material necessities and their cultural and their social and also their religious needs, and when they are suffering they must go out of this suffering by their means and also by the aid of the government and help people prepare to help the people, but not against the people.

Mr. Russell: "A part of this problem [land reform] is a land-title problem, and from what I understand this is really again quite a Brazilian problem.... The survey system of Brazil is still colonial, and a lot of the problems that look like land reform, in a more metaphysical sense of some enormous overthrow of the system, really have a lot to do with getting out there with a theodolite... and tacking down the land." Mr. Cardoso: "There is no particular reaction against America. Multinationals are German, are Swedish, Japanese, American.

We ought to be helping you as allies. The total population of what's left of Europe-Western Europe-is larger than that of the United States, richer.... We ought not to be hanging onto the tail, we ought to be marching proudly as allies of the United States." ...

WFB: You can't just say, 'Oops, I'm sorry that I was supporting Stalin during the period that he killed fifteen million people.' ... I want to prove I'm sorry by cooperating with efforts to spread the word, and the most concrete way to do that is to show that you are willing to identify... the other members of the Ku Klux Klan, the other members of the Nazi Bund, the other members of the Communist Party." ... VSN: "To my way of thinking, totalitarian societies are the ones that are supposed to say, 'In order to demonstrate your loyalty to the state, you are required to demonstrate your disloyalty to your friends.'

BT: "Rock and roll...was a conscious effort by primarily white artists to perform in a way that was black." ...DW: "One difference between jazz and rock is that jazz is not a song-oriented music....Rock is based on songs, and jazz hasn't been, really, for fifty years. There are lots of people who sing, but that's not the same thing. Jazz is an instrumental music.

But there is good discussion, particularly of the recent congressional investigations. Mr. Meyer: "The Church committee investigation did provide an opportunity to educate the American people in a very serious way. This was a chance to lay on the record what the KGB is, what the opposition is up to, what the real world is like out there--and yet so much of the Church committee went forward as if we were living in a perfectly friendly world, with no opposition whatsoever." ... Mr. Snepp: "The agency itself laid the ground for those very destructive investigations. .. --that is to say, [James] Schlesinger's decision in mid 1973 [during his brief tenure as CIA Director] to dig up all the agency's wrongdoings and put them in one particular place. William Colby was assiduous in pursuing these 'crimes,' if you want to call them that, and therefore the docket was there--and the only thing the congressional investigators did was to get hold of it and play it for all it was worth."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Half a dozen lawmakers had succumbed and had been convicted, though sometimes of a lesser charge than "accepting a bribe." Mr. Tigar is of course parti pris, but he is persuasive in explicating the distinction between forms of police action that discover already committed crimes (e.g., asking to purchase previously distilled moonshine whiskey during Prohibition) and ones that provoke a crime. MT: "I would have said that the fictitious character of the government's scripting was enough to carry this beyond the outer limits of permissible law-enforcement conduct."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

PD: "I don't think you can find a people anywhere in the world who are perfectly satisfied or even reasonably satisfied to continue to live in conditions as they were fifty years ago.... Those people are going to have a say in their government. They are going to want to have a say and they are going to struggle until they get it.

RH: "I think that there is a picture in the minds of the Reagan Administration--a picture of the economy as a kind of great coiled spring. It's held down by two weights: one is the weight of government spending and one is the weight of taxation. Take away those weights and the spring will expand, and the forces of growth will unleash themselves. My feeling is that when you take away the weight of government spending, you find that some of the tension goes out of the spring; and when you take away the weight of taxation, you find that the spring doesn't begin to expand to the extent that you thought.".. . LT: "I would be willing, in a world where you essentially shift towards consumption taxes, to bring the capital-gains tax on productive venture capital, plant, and equipment--I would even bring it to zero. On the other hand, I think the tax on non-productive investments--antiques, old silver ... land, gold, second homes--ought to be very high because I think there's a real litmus test as to whether somebody's serious about supply-side economics, and that is, 'Which of the many tax incentives for nonproductive investments would you be willing to get rid of?' If you give me the answer, 'None,' then I say, 'Look, you don't have any real serious interest in supply-side economics.' "</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Three dragons are selected as executioners, and, traditionally, they have done their job with obscene zest, not withstanding diligent efforts, alas unavailing, to bribe them." The topics in this lively and often substantive exchange include abortion, national health insurance, charity (as opposed to welfare), and the reasons why non-Catholic children go to Catholic schools. One sample: HP: "In an interdependent society such as the one in which we live, in which poverty and unemployment is often not the fault of the individual person, is there not a basic principle entitling them to at least a minimum security income without having to beg--which is indecent and inconsistent with the American way, as far as I'm concerned." WFB: "I don't think so. Certainly the Bible does not consider mendicancy humiliating.... I think this: that one should recognize a moral obligation to look after one's fellow man, but for you to recognize that moral obligation on behalf of yourself is different from your coercing a similar moral obligation on the part of somebody else."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Since President Reagan virtually began his conduct of foreign affairs by saying that Russian leaders cheat and lie, perhaps we might examine that statement, as history, and as diplomacy. Mr. Bundy, were you offended by the presidential outburst?" WB: "It was pretty outspoken, but there's no question that you can find support in the statements of all the fathers of Communism and of the Soviet structure ... I thought it was a bit on the outright and blunt side for openers." ... HS: "It seems to me that the two men [Reagan and Haig] together see the world a great deal in terms of... the global struggle with the Soviets--and I think that's the reason why they have picked up as the first thread the war in El Salvador. Somehow they feel there is a need very early on to draw the line."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

MK: "We've sat here over many years talking about the liberal bias of the press. You've written about it [to WFB] and you've written about it [to WAR], and yet we have Ronald Reagan as President. Somehow the liberal press was notable to stop this travesty, so the system is working, it seems to me, and I don't think we need any public or private mechanisms to chain or shackle the press." .. .

Every time Mr. Reagan or one of his principal colleagues takes a position, Mr. Lewis is there to deplore the decadence of the spirit, the decline in public morality, and the disintegration of democracy. President Reagan is fighting a three-front war: against Communist imperialism, against domestic inflation, and against Tony Lewis."(As the participants learned after the taping, this was the very day that he faced yet another antagonist, John Hinckley.) Though host and guest are poles apart, the exchanges--as in previous appearances by Mr. Lewis--are civil and often unpredictable. AL: "We are entitled--indeed, obligated--as the power we are to be concerned about national aggression or aggressive militarism in our hemisphere or elsewhere against our interests. That's one subject. The subject of human rights ... may involve the same countries but it may not. And I think we have to do our best to maintain our moral concern. It's our own soul we're saving. If we as Americans say, 'Well, we don't care about someone being tortured to death because it's being done in a country that's friendly to us,' we are the losers."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Should the state protect an employee who does so? Should employers be permitted to fire employees simply because of mediocre performance? Our guests come from opposite sides of the fence but are able to engage each other's arguments, in a way that brings us along even when the discussion turns technical. RG: "What employee being terminated would not first look to some extraneous, occupationally irrelevant cause for the termination? It must have been unfair because, after all, I am its victim ... I think it is counter-productive and dangerous to put employers in the position of accepting mediocrity because the price of enhancing the quality of employees becomes prohibitive." AW: "There are over 3,500 pending anti-reprisal complaints under OSHA ... I think that's a small figure.

MA: "In our society there are libertarians who think that liberty is the supreme value, and everyone should have as much as possible, without limit. There are egalitarians who [hold] the leveling doctrine of everyone should be equal, without any differences in degree at all.... The only correction of those two errors-the libertarian error and the egalitarian error-is to see that justice is the sovereign idea. You can't have too much justice.... Everyone should have as much freedom or liberty as justice allows, for more than that involves injury to others, and everyone should have as much equality as justice requires."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

EvdH: "Attitudes towards homosexuality have been more or less tolerant, more or less prohibitive and so on, but I know of no culture where it is regarded as a normal, accepted form of behavior." ...

JJK on the Carter Administration's human-rights policy: "I suggest that in politics it's terribly important to focus on the consequences of policy for the people who have to live under the policy. If, for example, we look not at the intentions of the Carter Administration in Nicaragua or Iran--where what they intended was democracy and moderation--but at the consequence for the Iranians or the Nicaraguans, which is not moderation and democracy but Khomeini and the Ortega brothers--that is, a worse condition of unfreedom than they had before--then one would think that policy was not a good policy."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

SG: "With the Human Life Bill we have an exceptional case because the Court declared itself unable to resolve a particular question." WFB: "A factual question." SG: "Yes of when life begins. Now if that factual question is central to the definition of who is a person then a congressional determination would influence the Court." Mr. Bork while no fan of the incumbent Court holds that "If Mr. Galebach is right ... we really have a constitutional revolution on our hands. It means that Section 5 of the 14th Amendment gives Congress the power to say what violates the 14th Amendment and the Court ought to defer....

Host and guest agree that there are serious problems in America--including severe inflation and second-generation welfare mothers--but how to deal with them? Keep the current, admittedly flawed, system and tinker around the edges? Or change it radically, in the knowledge that many people would be helped but many, at least in the short run, hurt? JAC: :What I focused on most in the welfare problem was ... the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, that piece of welfare most odious to the population at large--3 million mothers and 8 million children. Most of those mothers are either teenagers or 30-to-40-year-old grandmothers, who are basically on the second generation, and what do you do about them? It's easy to say, 'Put people to work,' but putting those people to work is an incredibly difficult problem."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In this installment of Firing Line's coverage of the region (first taken up in 040, with Conor Cruise O'Brien, and visited periodically ever since), the discussion focuses on the question, Should the U.S. actively assist guerrillas, like Jonas Savimbi in Angola, whom we judge to be more democratic and less Soviet-inclined than their opponents? SS: "And when the Angolans come to the conclusion that they want the Cubans withdrawn, I think it's not an untenable assumption that they will go." WFB: "I don't understand your assumption that the Cubans would go or not go depending on what the Angolan people want."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What had gone wrong? Mr. Peterson goes through a number of areas in which we have shackled ourselves with excessive government intervention. He also gives a vivid description of the differences--familiar to many Americans now, but not in 1981--between Japanese and American management practices: There have been some fascinating studies done on Toyota versus Ford ... For example, in the Toyota plant they have only seven classifications; the Ford plant has over two hundred work classifications." WFB: "Is that an aspect of union jurisdiction?" PGP: "Yes, this is union jurisdiction. Now as a result, the Toyota employee can handle several assignments; he doesn't have a narrow definition of what he can and can't do. As to layers of overhead and so forth, in the Toyota plant there were about five or six, and in the American plant there were nearly a dozen.... There is a much less adversarial, litigious quality to the relationship."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

GWB: "As far as armament is concerned, I support increased defense expenditures ...The problem in the United States as far as defense is concerned is that it isn't engage. The people are not involved. The people will only be involved, in my judgment--" WFB: "With a draft." GWB: "--when you have a draft, and unless you are prepared to address this problem I think you are talking nonsense.... Today we are faced with a struggle, which is basically a struggle around the world--not necessarily just with the Soviet Union, but looking after all kinds of situations around the world.

But as the Castro regime evolved towards totalitarianism, Mr. Navarro turned from it and joined the resistance movement, under the code name "Tocayo," eventually taking part in the planning for the Bay of Pigs. This freewheeling conversation frequently turns, informatively, to Cuba's place in current geopolitics, but what's worth the price of admission is Mr. Navarro's own story. WFB: "I should like to begin by asking Mr. Navarro ...: Was Castro a Communist when he entered Havana, or did the United States push him into the enemy camp?" AN: "I do not think Mr. Castro was a Communist when he came to Havana. In fact, I don't think Mr. Castro is a Communist today.... He is a Castroite. I don't think he has the discipline, the spirit of sacrifice, the dedication to be a true Communist."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

GRB: "Our disagreement with the [Warren] Commission ultimately is based on supplementary evidence ... What they did they did well; it's what they didn't have access to." WFB: "In other words, if you had been running the Warren Commission, you would probably have come to their findings?" GRB: "I probably would have, yes, on the evidence available to them. For example, they did not know about the CIA-Mafia plots ... to kill Castro. That bore on the possibility of a Castro retaliation.... They didn't have access to the great wealth of information that we did about organized crime, principally the conversations of the mob figures themselves discussing John Kennedy, the hate that they had for him and his brother Robert actually discussing their deaths....

SN: "I don't think we're the kind of country that for very long will tolerate a system that is, in effect, economic conscription, and that's what we have now. We are not getting participation in the military, except in the officer corps, of middle- and certainly not upper-income America. If we ever have a war--and God forbid that--we would see very quickly, I think, very severe protests break out because it would be apparent that the son of the banker is not out there fighting and dying, the son of the mill worker is. That's not the kind of country we've been in the past, and I don't think it's the kind of country we can be in the future if we are going to deter war.

Like Mr. Wolfe, above, he has brought a visual aid: a large map of North America divided not into three major countries (plus the Caribbean) but into nine regions, which he calls "nations," such as "the Foundry" (the industrial Northeastern United States), "Ecotopia" (the U.S. Northwest and the Canadian Far West), and "the Islands" (the Caribbean, including part of Florida).

RS: "My submission is that the values embodied in the 14th Amendment--values of racial equality, values of integration--dictate that there should be a constitutional right to attend a racially integrated school to the maximum extent feasible; that the only justification that a school board can advance for not busing for integration ... is that the so-called neighborhood school is administratively convenient to operate; and I would submit that when you weigh administrative convenience against the values embodied in the 14th Amendment, the value choice should be in favor of the duty to integrate." WFB: "... In the first place, I don't really think that any scholar who probed the origins of the 14th Amendment would come to any such bizarre conclusion as your own ... But you seem to be saying that to the extent that you discover that which you find very valuable ... you feel perfectly free to bend the instruments of the law to that purpose...."

It has been the most conspicuous scandal of two generations that a substantial number of Western intellectuals have been seduced by monstrous social regimes." The "pilgrims" in the title of his book, alas, refers not to people who have made the pilgrimage away from totalitarianism, but simply, as Mr. Hollander's subtitle puts it, to Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba, 1928-1978. He passes along the raptures of dozens of these people, ranging from Anna Louise Strong to Staughton Lynd, from Edmund Wilson to Susan Sontag, from Tom Hayden to Harrison Salisbury. WFB: "Is it safe to say that once you've learned political truths you are not again easily deceived?" PH: "No, I'm afraid that's not quite true, because many people who learned something from the case of the Soviet Union fell again on China and on Cuba, and are now falling for Nicaragua right after Cuba; so I think this quest for a good society outside your own is endless."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "Although we live in an age in which Castro was possible, in which Pol Pot was possible, and in which Ho Chi Minh was possible--and in which you admit that you did not anticipate the direction that the Nicaraguan movement would take--nevertheless, here you are saying about El Salvador exactly the same kind of thing that was said in case after case after case, throughout this century, by people who didn't anticipate what was the ideological fervor of people who are determined to eliminate human freedom."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Why do we simply accept as axiomatic that the Soviet Union would go to war rather than lose Poland? ..." JL: "Well, it would be a dangerous thing to pretend that they won't." WFB: "Well, it would be a very dangerous thing to go to war, too." ... JL: "This entire Cold War grew out of a mutual misunderstanding which has very little to do with Communism; it involved Russia and the United States. The United States, gradually after 1945, seeing the Russians' brutal imposition of regimes in Eastern Europe, believed that this had something to do with Communism. And it had nothing to do with Communism; it had to do with the presence of the Russian army in those countries."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Many of Taiwan's friends, including Dr. Judd, feared a slippery slope ("the Chinese mainland is reasonably convinced that if the United States continues to retreat, we will downgrade our support of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the point where it has no choice except to give in"). Real politikers like Mr. Holbrooke think even the FX is too much; we should accept the fact that there is one China and its capital is Peking, and "American policy must be dictated by our sense of our own national interest." For Mr. Buckley, the issue is that "You can't be friendly with the Chinese people and with the Chinese government. You can't be friendly to slaves and to slave masters.

They are self-described "ordinary people" who were shocked one day by their 16-year-old's account of what was in his civics textbook, and wound up launching a campaign to oversee the content of Texas schoolbooks. It's partly, as Mr. Gabler puts it, "a matter of indoctrination. For instance, in the government textbooks you'll over and over have little sentences about the need for government control, government regulation, government power, etc.--never any emphasis on individualism." But it's also, as Mrs. Gabler says, "the lack of teaching the basic skills. That's not what makes the news. The articles that have been written about us are that we've taken books out of the library, taken dictionaries out. And the interesting thing is that we have spent our lives on the lack of the teaching of basic skills." Miss Bonnell, in turn, is shocked at folks like these presuming to criticize the professionals ("We all have the right to bad taste").

WW: "Not at all. That's exactly the kind of thing that unfamiliarity with facts always breeds. ... We were operating that building at a loss--pure and simply economic loss--and there had not been a rent increase in some seven years ... and so our general secretary/ treasurer ... elected to impose a rent increase that would at least reach the break-even point. Mr. Nader was ... the major tenant in the property ... He resented the magnitude of the increase ..., and we had some words about it, and I finally recommended to Mr. Nader that since he owns a building himself... if the modest rent we were charging was that onerous, he ought to move his whole operation down to his building, where the square footage rent is more than twice as much as we're charging him . . . And his response to that was, 'Well, my goodness, we rent to doctors and lawyers and bankers.'"</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Mr. Gardner, who deeply loves the country where he served as his own country's eyes and ears for four years, explains: "The Italians are a fantastically gifted people. They export in a very successful way. We see it around us, whether it's Italian wines, shoes, fashions, apparel, industrial machinery." WFB: "And they have a very industrious black economy." RNG: "They have an economy some estimate as 20 percent to 25 per cent of the gross national product which is not even recorded. This is the classic Italian way of coping. The Italian people, for centuries, have survived by evading government. Many of the unwise regulations which weigh heavily on the big companies are avoided by the small companies, which either are exempt officially or exempt themselves ..." He adds, with reference to the ports Italy provides for the Sixth Fleet,that "The Italians have been an ally second to none and they don't get the recognition."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

An angel, he points out, is "a purely spiritual being, a mind without a body"; he quotes Thomas Aquinas's explanation that angels must assume a body to appear on earth--"as you would assume a coat or a mask when you go to a masquerade ball"--"because they must make a sensible appearance to the human beings that they are carrying God's messages to." Angelistic fallacies involve assuming that men are like angels: "Socrates keeps saying that knowledge is virtue. If a man knows what is right he will do what is right. Well, an angel, if he knows what is right, will do what is right, but a man won't."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This is a good Firing Line opportunity. I wasn't a supporter of Chairman Mao; I was a reporter of Chairman Mao, and I still am. They had a revolution in China, and it's the thinking that you represent which is one of our chief problems--not to accept the facts of life." WFB: "Well, you say you were not a supporter of Mao's revolution. I will now quote from you: 'The Maoist revolution is, on the whole, the best thing that has happened to the Chinese people in many centuries.' " JKF: "Yes. What was the date?" WFB: "'72. Now, have you changed your--" JKF:"Can you say the opposite?" WFB: "What's that?" JKF: "Can you say the opposite?" WFB: "Without any problem at all, in behalf at least of several million Chinese who were killed by Mao Tse-tung, and hundreds of thousands of intellectuals who were imprisoned by him." JKF: "The present view of Mao is very disillusioned, and it comes from the last decade of his reign, when so many people were damaged and China was setback.... The point I'm making is that you've got to begin with history."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Anything else that needs to be done should be done by the people of the society." A zestful exploration of some of the implications-- from, Can we have a CIA? to Would you let orphans starve? to this exchange, which begins with the examiner*, Ernest van den Haag, saying, "For instance, we prohibit necrophiliac action; in other words, you cannot legally try to go to a cemetery and have intercourse with the dead.

There is freedom in the United States, and I will carry on in the struggle against the military regime in Poland." This proves to be an illuminating exploration, starting with our grain exports to Poland, but soon widening to include the Soviet Union's reaction to Solidarity, the disillusion with dogmatic Marxism, and the state of detente. ZR: "I was seeing in Poland all the time the drive for a change... the very fact that more than one million of the Communist Party members in Poland joined the Solidarity movement. I myself was not a member of the Solidarity movement, but I was not hiding my sympathy for Solidarity. When the Solidarity delegation was coming with Lech Walesa to Tokyo, I received them. I made a reception for them. I invited the Japanese, although the [Polish] government was very unhappy about that....I just was believing until the last moment that maybe they will come to reason, that maybe the system will change, but then I lost hope."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Time in prison is interminable. There is no way to describe it....Corporal punishment would, in the eyes of the inmate, be more humane, but the impact on society would be disastrous."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

He demonstrates here the qualities that make him so popular in the City--he's feisty and funny, he views the rest of the country as duty-bound to support New York, and he has a basic grasp of certain economic realities: "New York is an area that has a lot of very poor people. Now you can say, 'Why don't you tax the hell out of the very rich?' Then the very rich will leave. You have to have reasonable taxation. There was a time when New York City wanted to put a really socko tax on estates, thinking the people who are dead are not going to care. But the people who were living, who worried about that new estate tax, said they were moving out of the City if they imposed it, and started to move--this was under Beame, not under me--and New York City had to rescind that tax."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Dugger loathes him, at least partly on the unusual ground that Johnson was "actuated by pre-nuclear-terror formulations of conceptions like patriotism, honor, courage, and these pre-nuclear-terror formulations, unexamined in a seated President, are dangerous to the human race." Mr. Valenti comes right back: "I recall in two hundred meetings on Vietnam, it was Johnson's inescapable fear of starting World War III... that caused him to do what later critics assaulted him on as a great omission, and that is to go in and win the war. He held back. He fought a limited war ... He never even countenanced the use of any kind of nuclear weapons." Never the twain shall meet--but there is solid information (e.g., on the 1965 intervention in the Dominican Republic) mixed with the verbal fisticuffs.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The first of these shows is in the normal Firing Line format; in the second show, the floor is opened to questions from a dozen other foundation executives there gathered. The topics of this lively discussion include what sorts of things foundations have funded and should fund, and whether, given their tax status, they are in fact spending their benefactors' money or the taxpayers' money. RWL: "The contributions that foundations make do change over time.... In the 1920s and '30s, for example, foundations were critically important in the development of science in this country and in the world, and played a part they could not possibly play today when science has become so much more expensive ...

The resistance that would wind up sinking the attempt stemmed in part from opposition to the amendment itself, in part from fears of a runaway convention that might, as WFB quotes one critic, "repeal the Bill of Rights." JDD: "If three-quarters of the states want to repeal the Bill of Rights, we're in a hopeless position vis-a-vis the Bill of Rights anyway." Mr. Heilbroner addresses the substantive matter of the deficit in this good-tempered exchange: "It's very important to have in mind that there are 'good deficits' and 'bad deficits.' And if one could assure ... that the government only borrows to finance capital projects like the Panama Canal or the Manhattan Project or the national road system ..., I can see absolutely no difference between the government borrowing and incurring a deficit for that purpose and a corporation. Furthermore, corporations do not pay back their debts. They roll them over."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A secret that is supposed to be kept for more than a year will not be a secret from our opponents, may be a secret from our allies, and will help to confuse the American people.... And since they are the decision-makers in this country, they have a need to know": to know, for example, exactly what might be done with anti-missile technology to really defend the country, as opposed to continuing with "an arms race of more and more of the same."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

The thesis he presents in this rich discussion is that, "every generation, America remakes itself," and that the era that began with the GI bill in 1945 came to an end in 1980: "I'm speaking of a particular time in American history when ... we believed that if we could reach the Moon, we could cure cancer, wipe out poverty, stop crime in the streets, and-- the phrase you've heard so often--'If we can reach the Moon, why can't we clean up the air?'

JJK: "I keep coming back to minority rights, the rights of the one individual, which you have defended all of your professional life." WFB "I defend the right of the individual against abridgment, but I don't say the way to assert his right is to immobilize the majority."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Here is Dr. Graham on the making of our first Minuteman system back in the Fifties, in reply to those who say a space-based defense is a chimera: "We didn't know how to make solid propellant rockets of intercontinental size. We didn't know if you could launch these things from holes in the ground, which is a very tough technical problem. In four years we had the force operational."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

An often-moving discussion of the man and of the consequences of his actions. Mr. Reeves: "There are two things that I learned ... in my six years of research ... that I was shocked about.... One, I discovered he was a very warm human being with a lot of positive qualities. But secondly, and this was what really stunned me, I discovered that at least by February 1950 McCarthy became a true believer. He is not the wholly cynical, amoral creature who appears in literature. Not at all, and this makes him much more dangerous."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Hart maintains that the Fifties, so far from being a torpid and conformist time, were full of excitement. (Mr. Buckley, who had founded his magazine smack in the middle of that decade, would scarcely disagree.) JH: "When you have a decade in which the most admired actresses are Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn on the one hand, and Brigitte Bardot and Marilyn Monroe on the other, you have a decade of creatively contradictory impulses." JL: "What I like about [Mr. Hart's] book is that it didn't pretend that the Fifties didn't produce the energy that created whatever happened afterward. There's always reciprocal relations between the generations, and this is splendid."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Think what one may about some of Mr. Kissinger's policies, there is no doubt that one is in here the hands of a master. HK: "One of the dilemmas of foreign policy is that when your scope for action is greatest, your knowledge on which to base such action is at a minimum; if you wait until all the facts are in, then the scope for creative action may disappear. When the Germans occupied the Rhineland in 1936, how did we know that they intended an aggression? Since one didn't know, one didn't do anything. By 1940, everybody knew that the Germans intended an aggression, and they paid for that knowledge with 20 million lives."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

They were largely critical of Mao and of the people who were still siding with Mao, the so-called 'whatever faction'--whatever Chairman Mao said is correct, was correct then, is still correct now. Hua Guofeng was obviously a target.

In 1960, 85 per cent were literate, and during that period we traveled between the debates of Lincoln-Douglas and Kennedy-Nixon." Mr. Adler's preferred solution: "If I could say this without being heard by anybody I would abolish all schools of education." Meanwhile, he advises, cultivate a proper perspective on academic specialization: "No one can be a specialist any longer in more than one field. I feel just as comfortable being a generalist in the 20th century as Aristotle was in the 4th century B.C. ... When I talk about an educated person, I'm talking about a generally cultivated human being, not a specialist."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

JCC: "This idea of the South joining the American mainstream--we always considered that this consisted of the South trudging painfully towards the mainstream; we never considered that the mainstream might move towards the South, which I think there is considerable evidence that it has." ... WF: "One of the things, if not the most important thing, that distinguishes it from other parts of the country is this symbiosis of Afro-American and Euro-American cultures.... It goes back to Twain, to Huck and Jim on the raft, and the black and white presence is very deep. Whether the colleges have been integrated or segregated, the closeness of black and white cultures throughout the South has been a very important part of every phase of life, from our literature to our history to our folk lore."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This is entirely a false alternative.... We can be free and we can be at peace, if we arm ourselves ...

I think it was Macaulay who said it was more important to bake bread than to have pianos.... But that doesn't mean we should all be baking bread and not have any pianos.

Topics range from defense to inflation, with a heavy concentration on Mr. Reagan's tax policies. Two samples: Mr. Buckley: "People paid more [taxes] in 1981 than they paid under Carter." Mr. Kinsley: "Not the people you are most concerned about, the people in the top brackets." WFB: "What makes you think I'm most concerned about them?" MK: "They are the ones whose rates you wanted to reduce down to 25 per cent." WFB: "It's true that they are the ones who agitate most strongly to avoid tax exposure, but 'they' is 37 million Americans, i.e., the people who pay more than 25 per cent." ... WFB: "Mr. Reagan would unquestionably resist an aggressive nuclear attack by the Soviet Union with a counterattack. I don't think anybody in the world doubts it.

We must have issued two dozen invitations, to the people whose names come obviously to mind when one thinks of international banking. They were all tied up. Like their banks. I do not mean to suggest that we settled for second-echelon guests. Merely that an unapologetic defense of banking policies is not likely to be heard." As indeed it was not, nor of the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, which had encouraged the banks in their disastrous lending to Third World and Iron Curtain countries.

Mr. Rostow was writing a series of books, each examining a case in point; one of his case studies is the topic of this absorbing hour--President Eisenhower's dramatic "Open Skies" proposal for arms-control verification, launched at the first Geneva summit conference in 1955. WWR: "So at the moment of the summit your duty was not to say, I'm sure Khrushchev will buy this.' All the objective argument was that he would not. But you should make it in total good faith, and I think Eisenhower did make it in good faith.... If you are playing with issues this big, if you could get a breakthrough, it would mean so much to everyone, your own country and to the human race. You don't simply say, 'My analysis of those folks is that they are going to say no.' You keep your powder dry, but you go out and make a fair offer."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Barnet starts from the assumption that we are the problem, not the solution. And never the twain shall meet.

Monsignor Cohalan explains that for priests, "The problem is very simple.... Canon law, which would take precedence in a matter concerning the sacraments, says with the utmost possible simplicity and finality that the seal of the confessional is inviolable, period"--even on pain of jail. In both the legal and the psychiatric professions the law and the ethics are less clear. As Mrs. Pilpel points out, "in some states there are no privileges of a certain type.... If a person is called upon to make a disclosure, he cannot effectively plead a doctor-patient privilege in a state, for example, like Texas, where there is no such privilege." For Dr. Tamarkin, "Here's the problem about this whole issue: it's between two goods, in a way. On the one hand you want the patient to be able to see you as in their corner, on their side. On the other hand, you don't want to see somebody going around murdering other people. So you are caught in between two allegiances."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

And Mr. Brzezinski is, as ever, hawk like in another sense as well, pouncing fiercely upon points of disagreement, in a conversation ranging from the Carter Administration's "normalization" of relations with China, to Ted Kennedy's behavior in 1980, but starting with Mr. Carter's speech about our "inordinate fear of Communism": "Bill, I was consulted and I even contributed, perhaps in a direct way but at least indirectly, to that very phrase, and therefore let me say what that phrase means. It doesn't mean that one should underestimate the threat of Communism, but it means that in the competition between freedom and Communism, we have nothing to fear--that our system is more viable, more creative, more appealing, that Communism is a waning ideology. And I really think that's historically true."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley points out that "there are more lawyers in Los Angeles than there are in all of Japan," but it is Mr. Harvey--who approves the LSC in principle--who tells of LSC lawyers going into Mexico to recruit immigrants "for the purpose of both employment and the direction of law suits against their prospective employers."

Blame also the social engineers, who, as; Mr. Down puts it, have made the schools into "psycho-social devices for solving the problems of our society."

Prince Hubertus: "I wouldn't be alive today if it hadn't been for the Quaker breakfasts which we received after the First World War. [Then] after the Second World War--" Mr. Livingston: "The present chancellor, Mr. Kohl, will be the last German chancellor who will have a living memory of this.... He remembers and refers often in his speeches to the CARE packages and the Marshall Plan aid that he as a young boy received, but his successor will not have the same memories, and I think this is going to be a significant generational change."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

And why is the deficit so high? "Nine out of ten congressmen and senators that I talk to are for lower budget deficits. They all say that it is a big problem.

If the probability of such an outcome could be reduced at the cost of another 10 or 15 years of the arms race, then perhaps that price must be paid ..." The reaction in Moscow had been, in Mr. Buckley's description--which Mr. Bundy endorses--"near hysterical." This rich discussion, which moves from the arms race to the current state of NATO to the "exaggeration," as Mr. Bundy has it, in President Reagan's hopes for SDI, starts with the letter itself. MB: "This letter is a perfectly extraordinary example of the imaginative and intellectual force of Sakharov's mind and of his independence. As one man thinking for himself, it's, I think, one of the truly extraordinary documents of the nuclear age,... and I think that really it is just that force, the unconquerable spirit of the man and his independence, that is so deeply offensive to our friends in Moscow."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Barron: "It is exceedingly difficult to attract anyone today in any part of the world to the Soviet cause on the basis of ideological appeal. In the Thirties most of the great agents recruited served selflessly out of ideological motivation, out of the belief that they were serving mankind.

Although there are no fireworks, guests and host being substantially in agreement as to the unacceptability both of old-fashioned racial discrimination and of modern reverse discrimination, there is plenty to talk about. MBA: "In 1979 President Carter offered me a seat on the Civil Rights Commission. I said that I wanted the President to understand that I differed with his views about preferential treatment by race and quotas. Therefore, three days later I received a phone call saying I would not be appointed, and I thought it was President Carter's perfect right to do that. It is in the Executive Branch." ... LC: "You have a preponderance of blacks and other minorities who continue to earn a great deal less than whites as a group....

To Mrs. Futrell, who by background is a classroom teacher, and whose commitment to the nation's children is clearly genuine, "If we do not have a voice at the Cabinet level speaking for education, then it is not considered to be a priority in this country." To Mr. Bennett, "I am a bureaucrat.

Mr. Solarz defends his bill eloquently on moral grounds. His host and his fellow guest point out that it is not moral to urge actions that will have predictably counterproductive results.

Mr. Conrad cites Immanuel Kant (whom Mr. van den Haag had early in the hour quoted to make a very different point) as having "argued that the state must never use a person as a means to an end.

But before we knew it, it appeared that the majority of America's newsmen and intelligentsia were discussing not so much should we have gone in as the near criminality of going in without complete freedom of movement by the press." Although Mr. Lewis had been one of the complainers, he starts out by saying, "I share your implied distaste for the notion that the most important thing in the world is the position of the press in life. I don't think that, and any sort of special pleading and self-pity I don't like." To Mr. Clurman, "As to the motive of the military in not wanting the press, that is both completely understandable and in my view completely intolerable." And we're off on a crackling three-way exchange on whether the press nowadays can be trusted as it could, say, during the Normandy landing, and whether the culture of leaking that began during the Vietnam War had become a permanent fixture. WFB: "Mr. Lewis, if you have a Cabinet meeting, and you decide which way you will tilt as between Pakistan and India, and you read about it in Jack Anderson's column the next day, are you excessively worried about secrecy?"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Torres: "It's the paranoia that American society suffers from with the tremendous influx of refugees ... who speak a different language and have a different culture and who just may be taking their jobs." Mr. Etzioni: "There are exceptions to be sure, [but] the American society is extremely open and generous ... Just let's talk about the last five years--the Cuban immigration, and a large part of the population of El Salvador has simply moved north, and God knows how many people from Mexico.... by and large, if you talk about American society, I don't think it's fair to call it paranoiac these days."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Any author who writes about the topic of group characteristics is taking a tremendous risk, but Mr. Sowell (a) is not averse to risk and (b) had approached his topic empirically rather than polemically, presenting data that show how the peoples of various regions of the world have fared in different areas of endeavor. As we have learned before on Firing Line, he speaks as lucidly and compellingly as he writes: "One of the things I wanted to deal with in this book ... is whether a group is formed by the society around it or whether, in fact, a group has its own pattern which follows it wherever it goes.... I looked at groups in other countries--Germans in Brazil and Australia and Russia, the Chinese in Indonesia and the United States and other countries--to see if they do in fact have their own pattern or are they simply reflecting what happened to them in that particular country, and what I found, by and large, was that they had their own pattern."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Various economic and political topics are brought up, but the one the discussion keeps coming back to--and the one with the highest emotional temperature--is immigration. These Texans, differing politically, nonetheless agree that immigration is not a local or even a national problem, but an international one. Mrs. Hutchison, for example, proposes that, instead of looking at ways of keeping people out, we look at ways of helping them build up their economies at home so that they can stay there. WFB: "My own experience with bilingualism is that it is an utter and total phony.

At other times he is less so, as when he accepts the view of his Polish acquaintances that "they are under Soviet hegemony and probably will be for the rest of this century." Mr. Michener gives a moving account of the ups and downs this country, in which he finds so much to admire, had experienced in the previous twenty years; e.g., the "Gulag formula" of keeping a population under control: "give people less and less food until they reach the breaking point, then feed them more so they can work, but be sure to diminish the food so they go back to the breaking point."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "How can that which has manifestly succeeded have failed?" VG: "You don't have to debate me on such a thing." WFB: "I know, but I'm asking you how ... to cope with that." VG: "Well, in the scenario . . . they created the failure ... by the fact that the Russians became afraid because we had placed the Pershing missiles." To Mr. Leonard, the fact that the script writer had said he wanted to hinder our deployment of the Pershing missiles means nothing: "Do you know what a writer is like on television?" WFB: "No, I don't." JL: "A writer can say whatever he likes, but what appears on the TV screen is so far from what that writer originally intended because it's been nibbled to death by ducks to make it palatable, ... to make it seem as though you're being provocative, but without ever really offering a significant alternative."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A crackling exchange between these two natural antagonists. RB: "You are not going to persuade the Soviets that they are the evil empire, particularly by aiming more missiles at them."

To Mr. Buckley, "the bishops were here leaving the moral arena that is their proper realm and meddling in prudential" questions outside their competence. To Father Hesburgh, disarmament is precisely a moral question, because "if we don't get this problem solved, all the other problems in a sense become moot... If the nuclear weapon is unleashed, everything else is all over." But Father Hesburgh does not indulge in secular-style fear mongering: "The world got to a point where it was rather fatalistic about whether it will happen or won't happen. There is nothing worse, I think, than a fatalistic world. We need hope to go on living."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The chain of evidence eventually led to MacDonald himself, and despite testimony at the pre-trial hearings by Drs. Sadoff and Halleck to the effect that it was all but inconceivable that he was the murderer, he was tried and convicted. Mr. McGinniss had begun researching his book on the case with the expectation of proving the verdict wrong, only to find additional evidence that it was right. He is rather hard on the psychiatrists; they reply defensively--but also movingly at times. SH: "There are some ethical things that are just excruciating and probably unresolvable. You are often using your empathic skills which were developed originally totally to help people and then turning around and communicating what you have learned as a result of using those skills to an agency which then uses that to harm an individual."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

When parents, again through religious conviction, want to remove their children from school at age 14? A painful but informative discussion.

The chief assassin implicated two other men, one of them being Norman Butler, now known as Muhammad Aziz. Although the assassin later admitted that he had lied about the other two, they were not granted a new trial. Mr. Aziz speaks about how his religion has sustained him, and even if Christians, including Mr. Buckley, will have difficulty accepting some of the distinctions he draws, his testimony is moving indeed: "Christianity doesn't lend itself to the black man holding his head up, but Islam does. Islam says you don't have to turn the other cheek if you're attacked....

He has an alternative idea, which he states very effectively. Mr. Coughlin, meanwhile, is willing to stick up for his own institution, the legendary state prison up the river" from New York City: "It's a little-known fact that of the eight thousand people who left this system in 1976, only 12 per cent have returned to prison within a five-year period for a new crime as distinguished from breaking parole on the old crime. Sixty-eight per cent are no problem; you never see them again after they leave."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But guests and host use enough concrete illustrations to give even the non-philosophically minded a very rewarding hour. WFB: "Nuremberg really was an appeal to natural law in a way." GN: "Some say so; I don't. In my mind, Nuremberg was an unreasonable thing, simply for the reason that the Soviets sat among the judges." WFB: "What if they had not?" GN: "Even then I think it would have been very much tainted by the fact that the victors sat over the vanquished." ... RM: "There are certain actions which in and of themselves are wrong--they would thwart the purposes of human nature--such as murder and adultery and lying.... These kinds of actions are excluded. But when you have the inclusions ... the positive natural-law precepts--be brave, be temperate, be just--they don't strike one as constraining prescriptions. They open up all kinds of possibilities of variety and diversity."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But the idea that you would give up your nuclear weapons and then whoever...can function in the Kremlin would say, 'Well, it's no use us having nuclear weapons if these people have given them up'--that is pure drivel."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

So far left had the party gone, however, that it promptly chose another radical Socialist to succeed him. High on Mr. Kinnock's agenda, as we learn in this high-energy exchange, were nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from NATO, and expulsion of U.S. military facilities from Britain. NK: "It might be possible for a large country, with expanses of desert or prairies or water, to be able to accommodate [nuclear attack] without the total annihilation of society ... but it isn't plausible in Europe, where we live cheek by jowl, one with another, and we know that the use of any nuclear weapon would lead to the obliteration of our whole society."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

MR: "You have a very large country with a small density of human beings per hectare. When there is too much space you can always abandon some land and let it go back to desert... We have no flexibility at all... . Such a long occupation of this land that we cannot gain any new land, but we cannot either abandon it." ...WFB: "We conservatives do not want commercial war.

The brisk and detail-filled discussion treats of Margaret Thatcher and Thatcherism, alone and in comparison with Ronald Reagan and Reaganism, on specifics ranging from inflation to defense (conventional versus nuclear) to the welfare state (and the fact that, while many Britons would like lower taxation, few would give up, say, the National Health Service). Mr. Knight: "The difficulty that we are finding with the United States is not that it's taking ... a particularly trenchant tone [in world affairs], it is that it's not us any longer that is taking a trenchant view.

He thought that when God died He would leave a huge vacuum in men's minds, and ... that vacuum would be filled by the lust for power,... and I think on the whole that Nietzsche has been vindicated by what has occurred in this terrible century."

Mr. Galbraith: "These weapons prevent the Soviets from their prime weapon these days, which is to try to terrorize Western Europeans into surrender." M. Chevrillon: "[There has been] a huge shift in the French intelligentsia... into some sort of realistic attitude towards the Soviet threat.

Chirac had failed in his 1981 challenge to his former ally, then-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, but, even so, as the wildly popular mayor of Paris and the head of the Gaullist party, he was one of the most prominent figures in French political life. On this show, he apologizes for his imperfect English, but his common sense comes through with Gallic clarity: "We cannot criticize the Americans' economic policies, and also ask them to help us in defense; that is a contradiction." "Our effort is to explain to the French people that the Socialist and Communist system is politically dangerous to freedom and economically failed, and that we do have a liberal system which could improve very much the economic and social situation."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The lively discussion covers the ups and downs of the current race; but it also asks what actually are the differences between the Heartland and the East Coast. Mr. Yepsen: "There are rituals and duties and routines that come from being tillers of the soil.... I'm not saying that it's better or worse, but it certainly makes it different to know in the springtime the issue is rain and getting a crop planted, and that's of concern to a businessman and to the governor at the State Capitol."

This attractive newcomer to politics (his first race had been the one for governor a year and a half before) speaks movingly about the small family farmer, squeezed as always by fluctuations in the weather and, now, by the huge agri-business conglomerates ("You don't have people in agriculture leaving it, taking a job repairing televisions, then when the economy turns around going back.... Once they're gone, they are likely gone forever"). He is also perceptive about the difficulties in governing: "You cannot run a government like a business. My government is a representative democracy, and my business is a benevolent dictatorship."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Regarding defense, if we are not strong economically our defense system isn't going to work anyway." WFB: "Well, that's only half true.

RLS: "The insanity defense really grew out of the attempt by judges three hundred years ago and more to try to explain to juries a very simple concept, and that is that all crimes require not only an act but a certain state of mind... One who is so dispossessed of reason that he cannot form that intent obviously cannot be guilty of a crime." ...

WFB: "Although I would like to conclude that there was something in the nature of a conservative revolution in 1980, I don't think it's true. I think people didn't want Carter to be President."

Valeo), and congressional responses to them. To Mr. Etzioni, sociologist, money is the root of most political evil. To Mr. McCarthy, sometime political practitioner (who to be sure is also a poet and philosopher), "There are other temptations. You see, we're operating as though the greatest temptation was money.

His unpacking of the questions that should be asked before "a single drop of American blood is shed" is masterly, as is his explication of how lines of authority should run in an Administration: it doesn't matter who speaks on foreign-policy matters--it is more usually the Secretary of State or the National Security Advisor, but in the Kennedy Administration it was the ubiquitous Bobby--but it matters greatly that somebody "is designated by the President, and perceived by his colleagues and peers to be the man designated by the President, to handle and centralize foreign policy....

Dr. Keyworth's technical credentials are unassailable, and he proves able to explain difficult concepts so that non-physicists can grasp them: "The Soviets' definition or perception of the word 'deterrent' requires that they maintain a pre-emptive strike, a first-strike capability, whereas for us it is purely the maintenance of a retaliation. If we can reduce those perceptions to a common ground--and I would contend that even a moderately effective ballistic missile defense system does, because it removes any military validity, any validity at all, to a Soviet pre-emptive first strike--if it does that, then we are both left with the threat of retaliation, which is where we started from decades ago, which is far more stable than the situation today."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Walter Mondale was the presumptive nominee, although neither Gary Hart nor Jesse Jackson had formally conceded.

For Dr. Edwards--the man who attempted to organize a boycott of the Mexico City Games in 1968 to protest South Africa's inclusion, and who did inspire the two black athletes who gave the Black Power salute when our national anthem was being played--race is the only issue. Mr. Axthelm focuses on the Olympics themselves, and the way their current size and the media attention that attract are effectively an invitation to boycotts and terrorism. Dr. Edwards: "Jackie Robinson accomplished something. He made it possible for more blacks to be more consistently exploited, more consistently and at a greater profit, than ever before in the history of American society." Mr. Axthelm: "The Soviets proved [in 1980] what I have suspected all along: it is possible to run a perfect Olympics so long as there is no individual freedom in the country." NOTE: The transcript lists the title of this episode as: "Looking Again at the Olympics."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Talbott is one of the "some": "I'm certainly worried about what Reagan has done to Soviet-American relations.... A really serious impasse in Soviet-American relations is not a healthy thing." Mr. Kaiser, while not as unworried as his host, refuses "to hold Reagan responsible for everything that's happened."

Mr. Navarro--whom we had met three years earlier (Firing Line s0475)--had initially been quite close to Castro but soon realized his mistake. This show starts with a few minutes of footage from Improper Conduct and then moves into an extraordinarily rich discussion of everything from techniques of cinematography to the reasons people join a revolution to the obtuseness of French intellectuals. One sample: WFB: "Why, given the ease with which information travels these days, does it take ten or twelve years to find out what Fidel Castro is like if you are a French intellectual?" NA: "Yes, that's amazing, especially when you think that common people, very ignorant people, know what's happening. For instance, the Haitians that leave poverty and dictatorship in Haiti seem to know very well that the country not to go to is Cuba."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Are the guests (and their host) rather one-sidedly anti-Castro? Well, as Mr. Buckley relates: "The producer of Firing Line, Mr. Warren Steibel,... invited six guests known for the enthusiasm they have expressed for the accomplishments of Fidel Castro, but none, mysteriously, was available." A lively hour even so with three deeply knowledgeable guests. Here, for example, is Mr. Luxenburg on the widely held belief that the Castro regime had greatly raised the Cuban literacy rate: "In 1977, in May, a committee of the House of Representatives went to Cuba on a (private) fact-finding mission, and published in their report--and we assume that this information was furnished them by obliging Cuban officials--that prior to Castro there were 187,000 students in Cuba. But there weren't 187,000 students in Cuba before Castro, there were a million. These statistics you can find in any old edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The conversation (particularly between Mr. Lukacs and fellow contrarian Ernest van den Haag) seldom quite clicks, but there are some good moments: EvdH: "The one thing we know about history is that present trends hardly ever continue."

Leach, a moderate Republican, concurs with some of Mayor Koch's strictures on the Republican Convention, although he expresses them more, well, moderately. Indeed, in his taxonomy "moderate" really does seem to mean moderate, rather than being a cloak for liberalism: "Finally, we hearken much like Bill Rusher does to the Goldwater and Taft traditions of individual rights. What we are concerned about today is a party that has moved beyond Barry Goldwater's individual-rights conservatism... towards ideological purity rather than the themes of America which are very pragmatic." Mr. Rusher, meanwhile, takes a relaxed view of the fireworks at the Dallas convention: "The conservative movement today is a pretty big thing and a pretty various thing.... Most of the differences in the Republican Party for the immediate future are going to be arguments within the conservative community ... That is, in a sense, just the sheer exuberance of growth."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The conversation is brisk and entertaining, although there are times when Mr. Green and Mr. Buckley trade volleys of contradictory statistics without any satisfying resolution. Better when the focus is on the moral arena: HP: "... whatever you think about abortion should be your own opinion ..., but the attempt to foist that opinion on the rest of the population would be unfair." WFB: "It's the equivalent of my saying that whatever I believe about civil rights is my business, and if I want to discriminate against people because they are black or because they are Jewish, that's my right. But you say no, it's not your right, because they have rights too.... There is an entire sophisticated culture that says babies have rights too, and they are babies two days before they are born even as they are acknowledgedly babies the day after they are born."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Grace proves to be a fine raconteur, who takes us with him through his excavations: "When we first went down there, we looked into how much the government owed--about $1.2 trillion. How much is the government owed? That came out to over $800 billion, including what they had guaranteed. It's not that bad. When is this money that is owed to the government due, and when is it going to be paid? We found to our horror that no one had ever aged any of that debt ... Nobody knew when it was due or whether it was overdue." The most comical/infuriating example: 46,000 government employees or former employees, who were receiving a government paycheck or Civil Service retirement--and who collectively owed over $60 million in unpaid student loans.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Pastor Neuhaus: "People forget the fact that the great secularizing forces of our time, the Third Reich in Germany and the Stalinist-Leninist movement in the Soviet Union, are emphatically anti any kind of transcendent reference guiding society.

He fled in 1959 after, as Mr. Buckley relates, "an uprising against the Chinese Communists which would result, in the ensuing decades, in a holocaust that ranks with Hitler's and Pol Pot's: 1.2 million Tibetans killed... --one-seventh of the population." The Dalai Lama "attempted, in India, to salvage what he could of the religious and historical culture of Tibet." Now, 25 years later, he had been invited to return and was pondering the invitation. He is an arresting world figure; but his ideas come strangely to Western ears: "if there is a clear-cut dialogue between Buddhists and Marxists it may help the Marxists and they may eventually become more human--less rigidity--for the Buddhists have the message of love and compassion ... and the Buddhists may learn some social and economic theory from Marxism. That is my dream."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Do Christianity and Buddhism have anything to say to each other, or are their claims antithetical? An energetic and frequently entertaining discussion, from which, two samples: Brother David: "You seem to think of Truth as many people do primarily in terms of that Truth on which we have a grasp, but that is always a very small part of the Truth. The much greater and more important part of the Truth, in the religious context, is the Truth that has us." Mr. Lopez: "To say that God and Nothingness are the same thing is problematical to me. Because the reality that Christians talk about is mysterious, and the reality that Buddhists talk about is mysterious, does not by any means suggest that they are the same thing."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Kemp sometimes sounds a little too gee-whiz to be true--but the intervening years have borne out many of his predictions, even if he and his colleagues did not succeed in enacting the flat tax that was at the center of their program. An invigorating discussion of what in Messrs. Kemp and Buckley's hands is a not at all dismal science.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland and Hungary were more or less in between; Rumania too. Yugoslavia was half democratic. We should have been able confidently to assume that they would be democracies today. But now there is just a very slim slice of Europe--Western Europe--which is democratic." And why? "Because we never learn. We are faithful to an assumed--an alleged--international law whose definition goes back to Yalta or Helsinki, which the Soviets simply do not respect." As predictor, M. Revel was fortunately wrong, at least for the short term. As analyst of what ailed the democratic West--inordinate self-criticism, toleration of tyranny--he was exactly right, and his superbly expressed jeremiad is still valid today.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On points where he is sure, he is not shy about saying so: "The preponderance of teleological evidence [on the unborn child] is that you are talking about human life, ab initio.... We would argue categorically, unconditionally, that the taking of a human life is the taking of a human life, and this is morally wrong." On matters where he is less sure, like the bishops' pastoral letters on nuclear weapons and on the economy, he is diplomatic: "There are a great many of us who do not consider ourselves experts on tactical nuclear weapons ... but most people consider themselves pretty close to the business of taxation, of poverty, of hunger, homelessness ..." A good conversation between two people who care deeply about the role of the Church in modern society.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

However, he also wants the New York Times to stop maintaining its more genteel memory hole: "A book by [the Christian evangelist] Dr. Francis Schaeffer... outsold Jane Fonda's Workout Book by two to one, by 300,000 to 150,000, in March of 1982, and yet Miss Fonda's book was number one in the New York Times best-seller list, and Schaeffer's book was relegated to ignominious oblivion ... If you are going to call this thing a best-seller list, then you ought to have best-sellers on it." He and Mrs. Pilpel--although she also wants not to burn books--tend to talk past each other, but there are good moments: WFB: "The Black Plague destroyed a higher percentage of the population of Europe than both world wars, but there we were dealing with a natural menace over which we had no control. But when you get a Hitler, a Stalin, and a Mao Tse-tung, [who] create three societies which between them managed to slaughter people in the tens of millions, you can say that a world that permitted this is a world that's lost its essential sense of gravity."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Ronald Reagan having just become, barring the repeal of the 22nd Amendment, a lame duck, Mr. Buckley asks his guests to focus on "the future of the Republican Party post Reagan." They do so more in terms of programs and philosophy than of personalities, in a crisp exchange. Mr. Green, for example, defends the Federal Government's public-housing program: when it was begun "fully half of the housing in this country either lacked indoor plumbing or was so run down it was a real threat to the life and health of the people... Now, as we've gotten to the point where the housing in this country is much better, a much better case can be made for something like the housing voucher ..." Mr. Gingrich, on the other hand, sees modern liberalism as still "find[ing] it very hard to believe that average people can do anything for themselves, and so they have a tendency to provide more and more professional help, which somehow doesn't help you."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Our two guests explore the doctrinal and pastoral aspects of the question lucidly and engagingly. Father Smith: "Nicaragua is not strong on theologians, but the test case has already been made there and they have failed the test.... the Church there is not for all the poor; it is just for the poor who have a correct ideological understanding of the revolution, and the split comes right into worship. If you are a member of the manager class, or the teaching class, or the bishops, you won't be given communion in certain [of the liberationists'] communities."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Messrs. Hitchens and Tyrrell actually talk more about the past than about the future, and it is illuminating (when they don't indulge in billingsgate) to get such different takes on the same set of events. CH: "I believe that the American Left, in starting the civil-rights movement for black Americans, in combating an unjust war in Indochina, and in beginning the emancipation of women ... changed the way everyone thinks and the way everyone lives... the whole world is in debt to the American Left for these three enterprises."

The ensuing conversation is lively, indeed at times obstreperous, but more enlightening than not. MFB: "Blacks didn't start voting Democratic in Roosevelt's first election; they waited to see what was going to happen that was different from what happened with the Republicans. And as old black people tell me in Tennessee, 'What was different 'bout the Roosevelts was: when they had programs, we could be in 'em.' "... NG: "What kind of interest basis is there for the black-Jewish alliance? The old interest basis has disappeared. It's true in the '40s and '50s Jews and blacks were fighting together for anti-discrimination laws--in colleges, in employment, in housing--but Jews don't have to worry much about discrimination now ... It's not a big thing. For blacks, of course, it's a big thing."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Then President Johnson declared War on Poverty, and poverty--disappeared? Alas, no; it instead began to increase again. The thesis of Mr. Murray's hotly controversial book was that the program had indeed caused the increase--and for reasons that were entirely understandable: "By 1970, without stretching the rules, without imagining some sort of welfare cheat, you had a situation in which a young woman who had gotten pregnant... could quite reasonably say that her best option was not to marry the man, and to obtain an income which was roughly equal in purchasing power to a minimum-wage job in 1960." WFB: "Some of your critics say it may make sense in the short term for the girl not to marry the boy. However, since this almost inevitably catapults her into a perpetual state of poverty, it's a very poor strategic decision." CM: "We are talking about 17-, 18-, and 19-year-olds in many instances ... You can think of it as people making incremental decisions from day to day and suddenly, down the road, they've locked themselves into a situation they had never foreseen.""</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But if we get no meeting of the minds, we do get the two sides' cases clearly presented. JB: "A lot of people put a sentimental value on having people on the farm ... but I think we need to put that in perspective; we need to put a price tag on that. The question is: Are we willing to pay an extra $20 billion a year in order to have an extra 50,000 people living on the farm? ..." RJM: "I am willing to pay a price to maintain stability, not only stability from the farmers' standpoint, but stability from the consumers' standpoint and stability in our industrial production.

(The gentlemen mentioned by name do the talking on this show; they are joined by their colleagues in a half-dozen of the group's favorite songs.) Topics include the appropriateness of song at an academic institution (conclusion: it's at least as appropriate as sports) and--a perennial sore spot with Mr. Buckley--the pervasiveness of rock. WFB: "How is it that if you walk up and down the halls of an undergraduate dormitory, you hear this terrible music that sells billions of dollars worth per year and yet you, singing pretty conventional-type music, are extraordinarily popular? How come the rock-and-roll culture doesn't sort of drown you out?" NK: "Well, you might find a lot of that kind of music playing in any of our rooms when we're not singing." ... SB: "I think that a lot of the appeal of rock music to our generation is found in the dance."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The Republicans now agreed that it was time to address the problem. Our two guests today are old combatants, Mr. Pechman favoring the Treasury Department's plan of, as he puts it, "eliminating preferences and loopholes and unnecessary deductions, and using those to reduce the marginal rates," Mr. Walker favoring a national sales tax. A genial examination of a technical question that has moral overtones. CEW: "I often say that Joe Pechman's difference with me is that he is very much concerned with the tax system and its impact on how income is distributed. Some people would say I am too much concerned with the impact of the tax system on how income is produced."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One of the most resonant moments of the show, in the light of developments just a few years down the road, is the distinction WFB draws between a totalitarian regime and the South African one: "If I were part of the South African government and I thought you were correct [Mr. North, in saying that there would be increased revolutionary violence], why wouldn't I go in the direction of more repression? Take East Germany. Ninety-eight percent of East Germans get their news from West German television, so they know how the other half lives. But years, decades, and generations go by and nobody expects any improvements in East German liberty, so there are other ways to go than gradualism."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Stein: "The source of our difficulty, the thing that got us from a 1 1/2 per cent inflation rate in the early 1960s to 14 per cent in 1980, was not the looseness in the system. The source of this difficulty was that we constantly tried to pump the economy to higher and higher levels of output by more and more monetary expansion, and we would not have done that if we had stuck with any kind of monetary rule, whether it was Ml or M2 or M3."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley starts out with a formal definition: "a system of political thought that tends to comprehend all important social questions, giving the answers to all important social problems." Mr. Minogue offers a number of applications, e.g., " 'Redemptive doctrines' ... are beliefs that the world we live in is the most cunningly disguised form of oppression and domination ..., that the business of life is to become conscious of it,which [means] adopting whatever ideological theory is to be recommended, and in that way to fight for liberation....

But the tone is energetic, the problems have resonance with viewers (urban ones, at least) throughout the country, and some of the prescriptions offered (regarding, say, rent decontrol) have since proved out in practice. RS: "I think the war and the rise of totalitarianism across the world scared New Yorkers and scared Americans. It really frightened the whole structure of society.

All three guests have spent time in Vietnam (Mr. Butterfield was there on April 29, 1975, the day Saigon fell); all have studied the political and military history. They and their host all agree that, as Mr. Butterfield phrases it, "We didn't lose the war on the battlefield, we just left." And that, as Mr. Greenway phrases it: "Wouldn't the real moral lesson be: Don't intervene in a situation and take a people under your protection unless you're prepared to stay with them?" Mr. Butler gives a devastatingly simple answer to Mr. Buckley's question why "Vietnamization" didn't hold in the way "Koreanization" held: "There's no Ho Chi Minh Trail in Korea, and it would have been terribly difficult to cut the trail altogether.

The natural progression of intelligent men and women is to stand further and further back from utopianism and say increasingly [that] what we've got is worth keeping; let's not throw it away until we've got something better."Mr. Carver: "There is a great tendency to mirror-image yourself and project your own views and ideas on other people ...

It's touching to watch them bear out Mr. Massie's diagnosis, above; and heartening to see how Mr. Buckley deals with them. One sample: GG: "Mr. Buckley, here at Yale a Chicano-Puerto Rican concentration was developed under American Studies, which I guess in your opinion qualifies as a meaningless concentration.... I think the history of a people in this country and the progress that they've made is very meaningful." WFB: "Well, I think if you study it as history or if you study it as sociology or even if you study it as anthropology it's interesting. What is not interesting is to study it ideologically, and I have a feeling that an awful lot of ideology is creeping into the study of the progress of Chicanos or blacks or women. That is not only, I think, mischievous intellectually, but I think also it tends to crank up an ideological view of the world that gets in the way of clearer vision after you’ve graduated."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Brookhiser was still an undergraduate at the time of Watergate but was already at that time a keen student of politics. This fine conversation with a man who suffered from his colleagues' transgressions but holds no perceptible grudge ranges from Watergate itself, to the abuses of the press, to the fundamentals of our political system. RK: "What I really tried to do in my book was to write a love letter to our Constitution and to our institutions of freedom. I tried to point out, particularly to young people, that ours is a political society, that politics is a noble pursuit--" WFB: "It's noble and also ignoble."

All agree that, as Judge Bork puts it, "This is a litigious society. It's a regulated society. It's going to remain that." How then to unclog our overcrowded courts? Mr. Bork suggests alternative courts, both to "deal with these simple repetitious claims which now flood the main federal courts and keep people waiting for years to get their case heard," and to try "very esoteric matters" currently being handled by "generalist judges." "Who is against specialized courts?" Mr. Buckley asks, and Mr. Schmidt replies: "I am against them. One of the distinctive elements of the American legal tradition is that it has generally entrusted the important decisions to generalist judges." Mrs. Pilpel, meanwhile, points out that the middle class "has a tough time getting into court very often," both for the reasons Judge Bork mentions and because of her fellow lawyers' sky-high fees.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Supply-side decadence." Miss Eberstadt: "It was only in the '60s that there was a particular break, when people thought it was no longer appropriate to make value judgments--to teach their children to have some kind of fear of God, to obey their parents--and when children were taught that... creative self-expression came before morality." ... Mr. Buckley: "Tell me, why is MTV so mesmerizing?" Mr. Ellis: "I think it is [because] the images are moving so quickly. The images are moving faster than they ever have before in the century in terms of film ... It gets to be like a narcotic....

The question was sparked by the career of the crazed genius Glenn Gould, who at age 31 decided to give up live performance, with all its tension and hassles, and instead only produce recordings, where, as WFB paraphrases him, "you can get it: just right." Mr. Page, who edited The Glenn Gould Reader, is inclined to agree with his late friend that recordings are now more important than live concerts; Miss Tureck, performer par excellence, sees the point but adds: "The communication that takes place between certain artists and the audience is something that cannot be measured. I feel that at such moments one reaches the highest level of communication with human beings." A high point of this spirited conversation is Mr. Chapin's account of sidling into a shop (only after he had retired from the Met) in search of a pirated recording of Nilsson and Vickers in Tristan und Isolde, and being greeted by the shop owner, who said, "Mr. Chapin, we've been waiting for you."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This often moving show takes us through the background and current situation of Nicaragua and its neighbors--including the fact that, as Dr. Alzugaray relates, elements of the Catholic Church (especially the Mary knoll Order) were actively helping the Sandinistas and other Communists. Mr. Reich: "Americans have this guilt feeling about what we have done in Latin America, and it exonerates, frankly, the Latin Americans themselves from any responsibility ... What happened in Nicaragua was a result of the actions of Nicaraguans. They put Somoza in power, they kept Somoza in power."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "That would have ruled out, certainly, making Stalin an ally in the last war." ML: "No, it means that long term it is impossible for us ever to have a stable relationship with a dictatorship....

Mr. Mandy believes--on the basis of evidence, not pious hope--that "apartheid cannot stand up against economic development: Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town--the social adjustments have been made, the economic uplifting is taking place, and the laws are largely not being enforced." ... Pastor Neuhaus reports: "Recently at the South African consulate ... a number of Lutheran bishops, clergy, and so forth were arrested--obligatory arrests, a little two-hour inconvenience--and then one person said afterwards, 'I'm not sure at all it did any good or it's going to help anybody in South Africa, but it made me feel better.'

The three experts address this emotional subject with bracing clarity. One sample, from Mr. Jenkins: "Our response to terrorism can't be to match car bomb for car bomb, assassination for assassination, embassy for embassy.... I say that for moral considerations, I say it because of legal considerations, and let me make the argument for practical considerations. That is not the style of warfare where we would have the advantage. Our opponents in that kind of warfare are hard to identify, hard to locate. We have many targets that they can locate.

Marcos's party had also won the elections of 1984, but he kept putting off a presidential election, even after his principal opponent, Senator Benigno Aquino, was gunned down at Manila airport--on Marcos's instructions, some people alleged. Meanwhile, the Communist insurgency in the countryside was growing stronger. Should we, as Rep. Solarz had urged in Congress, cut off aid to the Philippines unless Marcos implemented serious reforms? What would happen to our military bases there? A serious discussion with two members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who offer parallels ranging from Chiang Kai-shek to the Shah of Iran to election processes in Chicago. One sample: HH: "There are some similarities [between the Philippines and Iran]. There are many more disparities. For example, the role of the church in Iran, the Mullahs, can hardly be equated with the role of the Catholic Church in the Philippines. The reforms that we want Marcos to make are a return, a reversion, to the democracy that for a while flourished in the Philippines, whereas the reforms that were being urged on the Shah went in the other direction. As a matter of fact, the Shah didn't get deposed because he didn't reform quickly enough; he reformed too swiftly and too much."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Pike, who had resigned after nine terms to return to the practice of law, fishing, and boating, puts a lot of the blame on electioneering: "First of all there is a lack of courage in Congress, ... based almost exclusively on this massive need to get re-elected.... It was the alleged reforms of 1975, actually, which required everybody in Congress to cut off all their outside earnings ... In many cases congressmen have to get re-elected to feed their families." Apropos of the deficit, Mr. Dornan points out that President Reagan raised taxes in 1982, "because he made a deal with Congress that for every dollar of revenue raised we would cut three. We haven't cut a plugged nickel."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley begins by asking, "Is it [Mr. Green's] opinion that the waste to which he points would be eliminated if the government took over and ran our basic industries?" MG: "No, of course not. The book points out on the first page that the laws of growth, girth, and waste that represent the corporate bureaucracy also apply to the federal bureaucracy. But because so many people have studied the [federal bureaucracy] ... I thought it ... worth while studying whether that same law of inefficiency also afflicts the corporate bureaucracy, and we found out that was so." He sounds entirely reasonable -- but so does Mr. Frank, who roundly contradicts him: "You mention Xerox as an example of one company that controls their legal expenses wisely. I don't know why you don't infer from that that there are very little hidden profits instead of inferring the opposite." We may be left unsure of the answer, but by the end of the hour we know what the question is.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In 1984, Texas Congressman Phil Gramm had moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party and was elected to the Senate. Would others follow? (2) Governor White was being spoken of as presidential material, and this was his first appearance on nationwide television. Governor White's political hopes were not borne out; Southern Republicans' were to some extent (see Firing Line s0730). A genial and informative hour, beginning with the education reforms Governor White was implementing, and going on to federal deficits, redistricting, and the 1988 elections.

Mr. O'Brien: "Later on, [Kenneth] Bianchi was able to confess in great detail, which could be corroborated by outside evidence, to all the murders in his personality as Ken without ever bringing in this 'Steve' business. Nor had 'Steve' ever been seen before you [Dr. Watkins] talked to him, nor has he ever come out afterwards."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Father Barry sees this as "the first step towards euthanasia, active euthanasia by omission." This is an emotional issue on both sides, and one made both more urgent and more frightening by the tasks medical science has taken on in recent years. Miss Mehling: "Twenty-five years ago, when people were dying at home, you would never have thought about the need to try to shove food down their throats ... It was accepted that people did die."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

NM: "...writers of one country and writers of another country tend to have more natural communion than governments because we grow up and read foreign writers. If we have an affection for Russia it's because we read Russian novelists of the 19th century." ... KV: "[I want to] destroy the will of the United States Army to fight, and I would certainly like to do that with every army." WFB: "Oh, it's antecedent to your wanting to emasculate our army that you would have previously succeeded in emasculating other people's armies, is that the idea?"

One sees the full-blown civil-libertarian at work in Mr. Dershowitz's wrestling with the question of what happens at the local public school if a child is diagnosed with AIDS (Mr. Dershowitz winds up saying that parents of other children could be allowed to keep them out of school to avoid danger of infection, but that the parents of the infected child could not be forced to keep him at home). Is it relevant to ask how a particular AIDS victim acquired the disease? What should be done with someone who knowingly communicated the disease to another? Much to think about here--and although some knowledge has been gained, the problem has scarcely gone away in the intervening years.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Lewis says no--mainly because South Africa is backing Savimbi, and we would undermine our credibility with black South Africans if we did so too. Mr. de Borchgrave points out that Savimbi's UNITA is part of "this incredible new phenomenon called anti-Communist national liberation fronts," and Mr. Buckley amplifies this point: "Savimbi is engaged in Angola in exactly the same thing as the Contras are engaged in in Nicaragua. They're trying to decontaminate a revolution failed. They [the Contras] fought very hard to oust Somoza and bring some measure of liberty and democracy and justice. The whole movement was aborted by, in effect, a Marxist coup"--in Nicaragua by the Ortegas' Sandinistas, in Angola by Agostinho Neto's MPLA.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Harold Macmillan alone would be worth the price of admission: "I've always thought that the peoples of the old Europe, having twice in my lifetime destroyed themselves by a kind of internecine war, like the Greeks did in the Peloponnesian War, must now get together." And then there's Eugene McCarthy, bringing a poet's eye and an offbeat sensibility: "The only thing [Nixon] did [on going into Cambodia] that sort of saved it was to call it an 'incursion.' We'd never had an incursion in the history of the country. It was our first incursion." But Mr. Nixon gives as good as he gets: "We have to recognize that politics is a great drama. And I will give credit to our Democratic friends. Generally speaking, the Democratic politicians, the so-called liberal politicians, have been more exciting and more interesting. Now part of the reason for that is that they can be less responsible." And so on, delightfully.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Some of the "Did-people-really-do-those-things-in-the-Sixties?" vignettes defy simple quotation: Timothy Leary in his flower-child outfit; Allen Ginsberg playing his harmonium and chanting "Ommm."

It's a double standard." PS: "And for this we should make our young women subject to the draft?" Or Tom Wolfe: "If you ever have a preposterous statement to make, and I offer this as a suggestion to anyone who has something they know to be preposterous they have to get off, say it in five words or less, because we're always used to five-word sentences as being the gospel truth."

The zingers come too fast to count, but here is the beginning of Jeff Greenfield's introduction: "Hello, and welcome to a special edition of Firing Line. My name is Jeff Greenfield, and, no, there has not been a bloodless coup. William F. Buckley is alive, well, present, and, God knows, soon to be heard from. I have temporarily fled the sleazy commercialism of ABC News for the purism of non-commercial, taxpayer-supported television to act as your host or guide or ringmaster ... Most television shows don't last a single season on the air. Five years is an extraordinary achievement; a decade is often cause for national celebration. So part of our purpose tonight is to try to figure out the incredible longevity of a show that disdains every convention of the medium of television.... For instance, television is said to be a visual medium. The only element of visual interest on Firing Line I have ever been able to detect is whether Mr. Buckley would someday part his hair with his tongue."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

And the "reforms" of the Seventies have only made things worse. Whatever one thinks of Mr. Peters's own reforms, he does change the terms of the debate: "Practical reforms are also idealistic reforms.... If you ask people to give up public benefits that they did not need, like Social Security for the rich, again you would save billions and billions of dollars. So there are realistic, practical means of meeting the deficit that ask people to be their best selves rather than to be selfish. And I think people are tired of being selfish." ... Mr. Kinsley: "The ironic effect of the contribution ceiling in the post-Watergate reform laws is to eliminate all disinterested large sums of money.... you lose the potential for the occasional rich people who gave money in the old days. In part they were serving their class interests, in part they were one go trips, in part idealistic. Whereas with PAC people there is absolutely no hope."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The Progressive Conservative Brian Mulroney, running for Prime Minister after 16 years of Liberal rule--most of it under the flamboyantly Mao-and-Castro-loving Pierre Trudeau -- had, as Mr. Coxe explains, "achieved something that had never been done before: he won in every single province. Therefore we had, for the first time, a government ... that could speak for the whole nation rather than playing off sections of the nation against each other." And yet he had muffed the chance to pursue a free-trade agreement with the United States, had refused to back his own Finance Minister's brilliant plan for getting entitlements under control, and had increased rather than decreased the Ottawa bureaucracy. A serious exploration of a country that Americans take much too much for granted.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Does it matter how the world manages its currencies? According to Mr. Lehrman, "the 'elegant float' ... has the consequences of producing embargoes, autarky, tariffs, bilateral trading agreements. It causes nations to begin to go to war through economic means ... and thus lead[s] on to war." A stirring debate, whether or not one comes to believe that a true gold standard can be restored.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In fact, Mr. Adler stuns the examiner, Leon Botstein, by saying, "To say 'a wise young person' is equivalent to saying 'a round square.' Wise and young will never go together." (WFB: "Was Robert Hutchins mature when at the age of 27 he was made dean of the Yale Law School?" MA: "No. Nor was he mature when he became president of the University of Chicago at age 30. His immaturity and mine-both immature-caused much of the trouble at the University of Chicago.") This-dare one say wise?-hour includes this diagnosis of our current intellectual woes, unlikely, alas, to become inapplicable as the 20th century gives way to the 21st: "In all preceding centuries-the ancient world, the medieval world, and the modern world up to almost the end of the 19th century-men did not hesitate to arrange knowledge in either an ascending or descending order, some kind of hierarchical [order], so you ... understood the relationship of various parts of life. But in the 20th century that violates neutrality, that violates our detachment. We mustn't evaluate things in any particular way."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It is of course the cost of medical care and the aged." (One of the guests, Mr. Califano, was present at the creation: he did, as WFB puts it, "as much as anyone alive to give us Medicare and Medicaid.") And yet the tone of the show is not gloomy at all, partly because of Mr. Pifer's inherent cheerfulness, even when talking about "the year 2050, with ... 36 per cent of the population past the age of 65 and a median age of 53," and partly because of advances that have been made. JAC: "We've had a tremendous decline in this country in deaths from heart attacks, 25 per cent in 15 years." WFB: "Traceable to what?" JAC: "Thirty-three and a third per cent is traceable to change in diet, lowering cholesterol, one-quarter of the people quitting smoking. Only a tiny percentage is traceable to heart surgery, coronary by-pass."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The resulting Paideia Proposals were received enthusiastically by serious people, but with justified skepticism about their making it through the education bureaucracy. In brief, the proposals assert that teaching is "a cooperative art"; thus seminars should be an integral tool from kindergarten on. Mr. Buckley quotes the commonest criticism-"that we do not have a teaching class equipped to administer [this] program"-and we're off and running: "In every case where there is some degree of the Paideia Proposals being put into practice,... once that happens, that one thing [the introduction of seminars], it changes the character of the school, changes the character of teachers ... their own minds become refreshed.... In one of the worst black ghettos in Chicago, they've introduced seminars.... The children were so excited by the fact they were reading books and discussing them, they brought their parents to school and it changed the character of that community."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

Either we are idealistic like Wilson or we are clever like the politician must be to protect the interests of the country. Unless there is in the idealist some practical wisdom and unless there is in the politician some distant ideal, his world will shrink to the immediate survival, which is too narrow an ambition." "I often thank Destiny and thank my wife and thank everything that's been given me for allowing me to spend part of the day with thoughts that are not concerned with immediate survival, with a great mind like Haydn or Beethoven or Bartok--to be able to cleanse, as it were, to have all of me belonging to the thought.

But Mr. Stockman didn't get where he was by being a shrinking violet, and he defends himself ably. WFB: "How is it that this impression is abroad that you have repudiated supply-side economics when in fact the only tax, as I understand it, you say right now that you would endorse would be a consumption tax?" DS: "Because the media is glib and superficial. If you take this whole book, it's four hundred pages, there's a lot of complicated history in there. There is a demonstration that the choices we face in running this country aren't easy. You can boil it all down in one slogan: Stockman repudiates supply-side.

Mr. Baker maintains that it hasn't failed, exactly, although "it's clear that there is too much volatility ... We're really on an information standard, if you will. If I should say something about the value of the dollar on this program, it would have an effect, and that's why I won't say anything about the value of the dollar on this program. It would have an effect on the foreign-exchange markets. We have got to find a way to relate more to the underlying fundamentals." An illuminating discussion touching on the Japanese economy, the dangers of protectionism, Latin American debt, and the workings of the Marshall Plan.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

And the reason for this, it is generally accepted, it that the public perception is that the Pentagon is already quite stuffed." Mr. Weinberger defends defense, cogently and engagingly, on many grounds: that a nuclear deterrent is much less expensive to maintain than a purely convention alone; that if defense expenditures were cut, that would have knock-on effects throughout the economy; but, bottom line, that "we preserve the peace now by being strong enough to persuade any possible enemy that an attack on us would be far too costly for them to make because of our retaliatory capability." Next step: replacing what Mr. Weinberger quotes President Reagan as calling the "mutual suicide pact" form of deterrence with a real defense: the Strategic Defense Initiative.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

M. Kemoularia's government service goes back to a stint as Interior Minister immediately after the Liberation; as UN Ambassador he had recently joined the British Ambassador in vetoing a censure motion against the United States for our raid on Libya, which some people called a terrorist act. What is terrorism? Can we accept Mr. Netanyahu's definition--"the systematic and deliberate attack, the murdering, maiming, and menacing of innocents, civilians, for political goals"--which has the effect of exonerating the people who fought for Israeli independence of terrorism, since their targets were British military and administrators? A fascinating look at a crucial problem, even if the participants are by no means disinterested.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

In having helped to solve or at least alleviate some of our problems, they have not found solutions for some of the newer problems ...and have been declared bankrupt." ... RR: "We find, starting with Roosevelt's second election, much more class-based politics; that is, Roosevelt got progressively a higher percentage of the vote in each lower economic class ...

An attempt was made to overpower the policemen in the front seat; when it was all over, one of the policemen and one of the prisoners was dead. The other two prisoners, Gary McGivem and Charles Culhane, were eventually convicted of felony murder. A few months before this show, Governor Cuomo had recommended clemency for McGivern, setting off a firestorm (George Bush, speaking to the New York Conservative Party dinner, said that "one difference between Mario Cuomo and Ronald Reagan is that the latter did not recommend clemency for cop-killers"). Our guests on this absorbing show are well acquainted with the case: Mr. Kavanaugh was the prosecutor; Mr. Tigar handled McGivern and Culhane's appeal. MK: "When I look at this case as a professional prosecutor, the first thing I'm looking for ... is why would Joe Singer be lying? To believe [the defendants], Singer would have to be lying." WFB: "... Why would Singer lie, then?" MT: "Because his role in this episode ... was one of total incompetence. This is an inadequately trained, marginally intelligent officer with very little experience who, according to evidence, has reacted in a situation that left his partner dead." WFB: "He panicked?" MT: "He panicked."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Frankel was largely responsible for the 1984 regularization of New York State sentencing practices, but he and Mr. Tigar are agreed, in this deep and often passionate discussion, that those reforms did not go nearly far enough. MF: "Our sentencing practices ... have given unbridled power to judges to fix a sentence substantially without rules." ...

Mr. Sears's is clearly no fundamentalist crusade: what he is going after is material that incites to violence and material that affects children. To WFB's question, "Isn't it preposterous to say that Playboy has never been obscene? ... Nothing would offend them more than to prove that," Mr. Sears stoutly maintains that within the definition of the law, no, Playboy is not obscene. With so un-heavy-handed an opponent, Mrs. Pilpel is more the stock civil-libertarian than she was against Andrea Dworkin a year earlier (Firing Line s0635): "I am very much concerned about other things in this society which the commission was not concerned with; for example, shouldn't we be just as excited over homelessness, over poverty?"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Dershowitz, always good value, is at times breathtakingly candid: "If you start out with the assumption in criminal cases that the vast majority of people charged with crime are guilty, and I certainly start out with that assumption ... and then you follow that with the assumption that the job of the criminal defense lawyer is to do his or her best to present the case for the accused defendant, then, obviously, the criminal defense lawyer's job is not to help bring out the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; it is by all lawful, proper, and ethical means to limit the truth from coming out, because the truth will sink his client."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WL: "If you're a young officer who, say, wants to stay as a company commander ..., wants to stay as a fighter pilot, you can't do that. You have to metamorphose yourself into a bureaucrat...

Mr. Brzezinski: "The problem with population-wide defense is ... what have you accomplished? You have accomplished defense against one way of dying ... from nuclear missiles delivered by ICBMs. But why, in real warfare, should your opponent limit himself to killing you just that way, when he can kill you by bombs, by cruise missiles, by chemical warfare, by bacteriological warfare?"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The hour is less volatile than one might expect given his career (reprimanded by CBS for saying it had fudged its post-resignation treatment of Richard Nixon; fired by CBS for leaking a congressional report to The Village Voice; fired by CNN for reasons not entirely clear). In fact, conservatives are in danger of finding themselves liking their old nemesis, who gives here a pretty convincing explanation of the story he did for CBS in 1964 about Barry Goldwater's reception by Bavarian right-wingers. The conversation ranges from Goldwater and Spiro Agnew to prior restraint and CIA secrets ("with an account of Bill Colby coming to the press at one point and saying, 'If you go with the story now it will do immense damage.' Well, CBS and the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times and apparently everybody except Jack Anderson sat on that story. We are Americans").</p><p> Availability: Not available.

At age 83, Mr. Muggeridge found the subject much on his mind-not in a gloomy way, but from the Christian perspective that he had finally embraced (he and his wife, Kitty, had joined the Catholic Church in 1984). Indeed, the talk during this radiant hour is less of death than of life: "People are inclined more than ever today to speak of the quality of life. They want to improve the quality of life, and they've gone to very great lengths sometimes to do it. But they've nearly totally overlooked what is true necessity, and that's the sanctity of life." ... "Ultimately, we belong to a proposition of love, and that proposition of love will inevitably work if you surrender to it.

Not the fastest-moving show, but a helpful look at a region that North Americans tend to regard as the home of bananas, revolution, and corruption.

There are no fireworks on this show, but some pleasant conversation on topics of general interest--mainly, as WFB phrases it, "Why is the South still preponderantly Democratic, notwithstanding its inclination to Republican Presidents?"

The controversy attracted national constituencies on both sides: Mr. Farris was backed by the Concerned Women for America, an anti-secularist lobby, and Mr. Dyk was backed by Norman Lear's People for the American Way. To the plaintiffs, the "open ended" questions used in the so-called "character education curriculum" are perniciously relativistic; to the defense, as Mr. Dyk puts it, "I think the beliefs are sincere, but I also think they're very, very broad beliefs and they're fundamentally inconsistent not only with the values of public education but with the skills that public education is trying to teach."

Aquino was promptly jailed on charges of murder and subversion, and his sole link with the outside world became his wife, Corazon (Cory), who up till then had played a very private role. In 1980 Aquino was permitted to go to the United States for heart surgery, taking his family with him. In 1983 he returned to resume his political career, and was gunned down at the airport. (On Marcos's orders? Mr. Pelaez: "Well, let's say that he created the environment which led some people to believe that they were doing him a service by eliminating Mr. Aquino.") In an election held in February of 1986 Mrs. Aquino defeated President Marcos; when he attempted to overturn her victory, a military rebellion backed by massive street demonstrations forced him to flee. At the time of this show, Mrs. Aquino had just paid her first state visit to the United States, to wild acclaim. Mr. Pelaez, whom she had called out of retirement to be her ambassador, here recounts his country's recent history--often very movingly--and offers his own thoughts, less on "where is Cory going" than on what the U.S. should do.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A serious (but far from low-key) discussion of a serious problem. EK: "We can't wait! The numbers that are now using drugs are growing every day. The federal figure is that 5,000 people who never used cocaine before will use it today, and 5,000 new ones to be added will use it tomorrow and every single day. Can we permit that to go on?" "I'm a supporter of the military, I believe the Soviet Union's a threat to the free world, I don't want us ever to be second best.

"Obviously" as Mr. Buckley puts it "there was more in the background" to cause this eruption and our guests all superbly well spoken and well informed explore that background here. Mr. Knight: "It is ironical the way the roles have reversed. In the 19th century ... it was the Americans who were constantly belaboring the imperial powers.... Now the boot is on the other foot because we have lost power we're a rather ineffectual country ...

His soft-spokenness only adds to the shock value of some of his assertions; that, plus the fact that he is not some fringe figure: a 1982 BBC poll, as Mr. Buckley relates in his introduction, "found him to be the second most admired man in Great Britain, coming in just after the Pope." Mr. Livingstone: "I think most probably Nicaragua's a more democratic society than the United States of America at this point in time."

Mr. Tebbit's delivery is restrained, but he is extremely knowledgeable and at the heart of current British politics. Samples: "We have decisively changed people's thinking over some of these old shibboleths of 19th-century socialism; the Labour Party ought to be grateful to us for helping to bring them into the early 20th century." "I must say the class structure in Britain has never worried me unduly, coming from my background [straight from high school into journalism, thence to the RAF and a stint as a civilian pilot] to being Chairman of the Conservative Party....

Father Curran is the professor who had been told by the Vatican that he could no longer teach theology at a pontifical university because of the heterodoxy of his views; he says: "The Church will never change and it will never make the word and work of Jesus meaningful and appropriate in the contemporary scene unless theologians are able to raise these questions [e.g., concerning birth control]."

By December 11, John Poindexter and Oliver North were household words, and critics were asking of the President, What did he know and when did he know it? A crackling discussion among four experienced observers, each with his own perspective--for example, Mr. Clurman dissecting the title question: "One, if it turns out he knew about the Contra operation ..., then he's lied about it;... secondly, if it turns out he just didn't know about it at all, then he's wounded because he's not in charge of his government... ; thirdly, if he was inattentive, then, forgive me, he sounds dumb;... or, fourth, if he was told and he forgot about it, that's rather alarming.""</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Our guests, old pros all, advise the President firmly to take a hard line, and Mr. Davidson advises him to take a really hard line ("I would say that instead of concerning himself solely with what is good in terms of his political perspective, I would say let's talk about the true state of the Union. And in doing that, one of the texts that I would advise him to look to is Jonathan Edwards's sermon about the sinners in the hands of an angry God, where he points out that sometimes you can sin a long time and not be brought to justice for it, but eventually it catches up with you. And I think we are in that position in terms of the federal deficit"). A lively four-handed conversation that goes back and forth between political tactics and policy substance.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Halberstam's book approaches the story by offering parallel portraits, of the Nissan and Ford automobile companies. This hour offers no fireworks, but solid exposition and penetrating insights. Mr. Halberstam: "The Japanese worker of today is really rather more like our grandparents or the great-grandparents of people in Detroit. He's someone who takes that job--and he's an immigrant, really: not someone from a foreign country, but from a very primitive peasant life--and he can compare his life as a Nissan worker with the almost feudal condition of his parents on a primitive farm: how poor they were, how little dignity they had, how much illness there was, how little food, how vulnerable they were to forces outside their control."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The summit broke down only when Secretary Gorbachev said, "Oh, by the way, and you'll stop this Star Wars business." General Rowny has been dealing with apocalyptic matters most of his adult life, but it seems to have dampened his spirits not at all, and he takes us genially through the ins and outs of arms control. ER: "The Soviets say that they don't want a nuclear war because a nuclear war could never be won ... Yet they continue to pile up large numbers of nuclear weapons, and how do you account for this anomaly? They must feel that there's some psychological value ... Now if we could reduce the number of weapons so that neither side had a first-strike capability--we don't have one today, the Soviets do--then we have begun to reduce the risk of nuclear war."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Over to our guests, old antagonists, spirited as always. Mrs. Pilpel: "Parents ... know that a dangerous situation exists where there's ignorance ...they do not feel adequate in explaining things to their own children, and they are delighted at the prospect that decent information... will be given in an academic atmosphere, where the children learn about other things." Mr. van den Haag: "Parents are very willing, it seems to me, to abdicate their authority when they are told there are specialists who know how to do these things.

One sample from Mr. Kissinger: "Gromyko was rather rigid and morbidly suspicious. Gromyko was like an African rhino who charged in a straight line, always quite predictably. Now they've got Dobryn in there, who was ambassador in Washington and who must have taught them that what you see is what you get, and you can afford to accept American proposals because they indeed may not be in the American interest.

As WFB puts it, "He was handed a state close to bankruptcy and eight years later, following policies which we will examine during this hour, left a state regenerated." Unfortunately, as the nation would learn over the next two years, Mr. du Pont's charisma level does not match his intelligence or his good nature. PdP: "Gary Hart ran for President for a year and a half, and Walter Mondale turned to him one day and said, 'Where's the beef?' Pete du Pont's campaigning started by putting the beef on the table the first day: ending farm subsidies, tying drivers' licenses to drug tests, researching and deploying the Strategic Defense Initiative, and so forth."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

If not, why not? The two traditionalist Anglicans hold (a) that there is no warrant in Scripture for women priests, and (b) that for Anglicans to go further down this road would block any possible reunion with Rome or Constantinople. (Father Oddie: "A great Episcopal bishop once said,... 'It may well be that it is the historic vocation of the Episcopal Church ... to show the rest of the Catholic Church that [the ordination of women] does not work.' ") Bishop Spong holds that the Bible is not much of a guide, because "the place of women in the Biblical tradition is a very ... sexist, oppressive position ... that reflects the period." A crackling debate on a topic with implications for all the Eucharistic churches.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What would you do if you won this debate today and we didn't have any type of defensive capability?" Examiner Mark Green: "I would say, 'That congressman, he made it more likely the Soviets would launch a first strike because of his insane technology called SDI' " JC: "I asked a legitimate question.

Mr. Eagleburger denies that our allies are unreliable: "In my experience ... and particularly when dealing with Europe, when an American went behind closed doors and said, 'We have had enough, and we're not asking now, we're telling you, this has got to stop, 'ninety-nine times out of a hundred, that in fact happened."

It is alleged he was known as 'Ivan the Terrible' during the terrible days of Treblinka, the most consummate killing factory in the history of the world." John Demjanjuk had been an American citizen for forty years, but had been tracked down by the Office of Special Investigations, established in 1979 to hunt for Nazi war criminals. In this chilling debate on a gruesome subject, Mr. Ryan asks, "Does it shock one's conscience that Karl Linnas, who has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in American courts to be a mass murderer, might now face a death sentence [in the Soviet Union]?" Mr. Zumbakis replies that it does shock the conscience "to take an alleged war criminal and send him to certified war criminals for trial.... I think Americans first of all should be tried here and punished here ... If we're dumping people that we don't want to punish ourselves, we're avoiding a moral obligation."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Aren't you going to be relieved, as a journalist, when your friend leaves Washington, so you won't feel inhibited by friendship to defend what's indefensible?" WFB: "You as a lawyer know what it's like to defend the indefensible, I suppose. But I ask myself: What would be the alternative?

And when they buckle down to analysis, they are acute if not scintillating. CC: "What we were able to do was to differentiate what the intervention of government might be. [Southerners] don't want the Federal Government intervening. They do want an activist state and local government dealing with problems." ... JM: "I got maybe 15 percent of the black vote [in 1984].

This has got to change, for ... a very big event is scheduled in Korea next spring: the beginning of democracy." Mr. Walker is known as a conservative, Mr. Holbrooke as a liberal, but their perceptions of Korea are as one. What this hour lacks in fireworks it more than makes up in vivid description and analysis. Mr. Walker: "The Korean political style is to go right up negotiating ... to the very precipice, and then back off and come down with a practical, pragmatic solution. What worries me is, sometimes we in the United States . . . don't understand some of the dynamics of what's occurring in that society." Mr. Holbrooke: "North Korea is the closest thing on earth today to George Orwell's 1984. It is a true, crazy nightmare of terror and totalitarianism. [South] Korea is a place where income is rising, people have a growing freedom to move around, and things are moving forward."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Still, an interesting and often moving look at the sad state of the American academy. AB: "Since I was in a university, since I began in 1946, the universities were instruments of egalitarianism. It was there that the civil-rights movement was generated. Everybody I know affirmed those American principles and worked for them. And then suddenly, when the movement came to its head, it said that the universities were corrupt instruments of the old accommodation. So the very source, the place where the principles were held, and knowingly held in a scholarly way, where people could affirm them not only with their passion but with their reason, was discredited."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

She is more comfortably positioned opposite the formidable Mrs. Schlafly. Both guests agree that, despite the demise of the Equal Rights Amendment, the feminist movement has changed the face of America--but they sharply disagree as to whether that is for good or ill. HP: "I would think it would be generally conceded that through the efforts of organizations like Planned Parenthood we have done a great deal to decrease the kind of terrible poverty, desperation, and illegal abortions which characterize the Third World." PS: "Well, that's one point of view, I think you could make quite an argument that because of the Planned Parenthood ideology--the promotion of promiscuity with contraceptives--we have all the problems of babies born out of wedlock today. Once you increase the level of people who are engaging in promiscuity, you're going to have more babies and you're going to have more poverty."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

JH: "Europe, in effect, came to an end in 1940." ... FR: "I remember August 1914, and yet I remember it slightly differently with every decade, as things come on. It isn't the same 1914 for me in 1987 as it was in '67." ... WS: "Jeff talks about 1940 as a watershed year, a year that separates the past from the present absolutely in some way. Nostalgic historians are apt to locate that turning point wherever they want." WFB: "Wherever it's convenient." WS: "Well, it isn't just a matter of convenience, it's something the historian feels very deeply--that everything before that point is different from everything after it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As WFB relates in his introduction, General Walters has been on the spot for four decades-from attending the meeting between President Truman and General MacArthur on Guam, to arranging for the meetings of Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho in Paris. One sample from General Walters: "The first thing you have to remember about the UN is that of 159 members, there are about 45 democracies. So you've got to understand that the language spoken there is not the language of democracy. It's the language of the one-person state or the one-party state."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

What ensues is a correspondingly high-level discussion, with a great deal worth thinking about. Two samples: GW: "Catholics have something that the evangelicals, I think are beginning to understand that they need, and that is a way to talk about moral norms in a pluralistic society. We call it natural-law theory; they call it general revelation." ... MN: "The bishop on Long Island said that he had a disagreement in conscience with Bill Casey. As I read the text, it wasn't a difference in conscience at all, it was a difference in political judgment about what’s going on. Now to make that a matter of conscience, I think, is a bit of theological imperialism."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Although our guests don't agree with each other on all their prescriptions, they are both sufficiently opposed to their host that the two sides' positions are brought out in sharp relief. RR: Protectionism is not the way to go because protectionism ends up blaming them for a problem that is fundamentally our problem. Americans are living high on the hog, and unless we become more productive we are simply going to slip into deeper and deeper debt to the rest of the world." WFB: "Well, now, I would maintain, which both of you would disavow, that the principal delirium under which we operate that makes this possible is the myth that any dollar that's appropriated in Washington is self-generating."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Picasso was a great painter, but his views on politics were absurd. Ezra Pound was a great poet, but he was a rabid anti-Semite who should have been hanged." ...

This time he finds himself facing a trio to his right. A delicious hour, with some surprises. WFB: "I tend to be nervously impatient ... and that nervous impatience, for instance, in the American Revolution would probably have had me on the side of Sam Adams rather than John. And in Israel I probably would have joined the Irgun rather than its more sedentary alternative. And in South Africa I would have said: 'To hell with these people, I'm not going to live another day as a slave. I'm going to start shooting people.' I'm not saying this is wise or prudent, I'm saying this is the way I would behave, probably." WAR: "Bill, every once in a while, whether he knows it or not, gets his kicks out of taking the slightly angular position just to watch the ball bounce that way. He doesn't, I think, regard it as that. He'll have an elaborate, almost theological justification for what he's done.

But they speak also of its limits (Mr. Hyland: "When the issue is joined at the policy level, the Sovietologist then really doesn't count for very much, because other interests come into it"), and, under WFB's questioning, they move away from how they know to what they (think they) know.

Two samples: LNC: "Judge Bork['s]... mind, in my own view, is quite open on whether he would overrule Roe v. Wade if he had the opportunity. But if he were to say in the hearing, 'The first chance I get I will overrule Roe v. Wade,-- I think a motion to disqualify him in that case, when it comes up, would lie properly." ...

If it cannot, our view is you need to continue aid to the resistance as the only other method short of U.S. use of force to obtain that goal."

This hour offers a fascinating tour through the implications of the First Amendment and the workings of our civil court system.

That would mean that one-third of our high-school seniors think it happened after 1910 and one-third before 1810." How did this happen? WFB: "Who is the educational establishment?" LC: "Well it's all of us, I suppose. We are all the enemy in the sense that, I think, as a nation we haven't valued history and literature as much as we should." ... DR: "The issue is not, Are we doing better or worse? That would be like saying: Well, let's not worry about poverty, because there was worse poverty 50 years ago ...

Socialism in any of its forms is, it seems to me, a very poor bet." A rigorous look at a fundamental question. PLB: "When ordinary people are given a choice, they almost always opt for capitalism.... It's the intellectuals who are typically those who do not like capitalism and adhere to various socialist ideologies."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Impressive and articulate, Mr. Weinberger has no trouble keeping track of both forest and trees. WFB: "I can understand people who get annoyed when ... the Spanish tell us that they're not going to really let us use their air base--the primary purpose of which is to defend Spain, not Wichita." CWW: "Well, it's to defend NATO. Another purpose that is very close to the primary purpose is to defend the United States. We aren't in NATO and we aren't in Japan for altruistic reasons only. We're there because forward defense is the very best kind of defense. I would much rather defend California in New Guinea or South Korea than I would in Oregon."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But they quickly move from a technical discussion of the candidates to the substance of what was discussed. WFB: "Well, take ... farms. Kemp reacted with horror at the thought effacing Iowa with a platform of badmouthing farm subsidies. Reagan was there a year ago and said, 'I want to remind you all that under my Administration you've been paid four times as much as by any previous Administration.' This, from a party that seeks to shrink federal subsidies and to balance the budget, is intellectually unnerving, isn't it?" CH: "But politically very honest." WFB: "Politically very what?" CH: "Honest." WFB: "Well, I don't really think that's correct." CH: "Or realistic...." CL: "You know, Reagan was also talking about phasing out price supports over a period of time, but the difference of course is that he's not running for anything any more." LB: "Reagan is also making a point that that would be the goal if our trading partners cut down or cut out their support of their agricultural industries in their several countries." WFB: "That's like saying, 'I won't murder anybody as long as I can see that nobody else is murdering somebody.' "</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Now, in Nicaragua, I would be willing to settle for a government that the Nicaraguans were willing to settle for, providing the Nicaraguans were willing to choose that government through some sort of free and self-determining processes. But they have a government that's been imposed by force, that governs by force, which force is provided by a remote foreign power."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As WFB poses the question, "What were [the candidates] saying to American conservatives on the issues? ... Indeed, what is it that conservatives most wish to hear these days?" Occasionally rambling but often insightful. RB: "If the person who wins the Republican nomination has any political intelligence at all, which may eliminate George Bush, they have to take into account the force and the effect that Robertson has had." ... WFB: "The thing [Haig] said that struck me with greatest force is: Look we ought to be awfully happy that we're not living in a nuclear-free world. Fifty million people were killed the last time we had a nuclear-free war.... Now I think that's a very important point to make at a moment when the President of the United States, who is our leader, has taken, in effect, a position that thinks in terms of international denuclearization."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The discussion begins with the Space Shield--SDI--but Mr. Buckley is soon leading his guest into reminiscences. Dr. Teller: "We now know that the dropping of the bomb did not change a single vote in the Japanese war cabinet: three of them were for unconditional surrender before Hiroshima, and three for fighting on for better terms, and not a single vote was changed, except that the Emperor violated the constitution and appealed to the people.... Had we demonstrated, had we dropped an atomic bomb at 30,000 feet over Tokyo Bay that would have lit up the evening sky, that would have been seen and heard by 10 million Japanese--heard like thunder--not a single person would have been killed. I think the Emperor would have acted."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The result is some good moments mixed in with a good deal of floundering. Examiner Christopher Hitchens: "Was I wrong in getting the idea that nothing will satisfy you but the removal of the FSLN--Sandinista--government from power in Managua?" Mr. Ramirez: "No. Only a true democratic system will satisfy us. They can remain with their party if they want. That's not a problem.... So what we want is for them to dismantle the totalitarian system they have been trying to implement... Dismantle the ration cards which they use to control the population; dismantle the security system they have--we call it CDS, the committee of defense in the slums--that they use to repress the people; that they separate the state from the party, the army from the party."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

But there were signs that they might be thinking of pulling out, and the UN General Assembly--in a move led by, among others, Mr. Birch--had voted to condemn the occupation. About one-third of this show is devoted to viewing a British documentary on the war in Afghanistan. Mr. Birch gives historical perspective ("I think that the Russians have come to realize after all these years and the bravery of the Afghan resistance--they have learnt a lesson that we in fact learnt in the last century, which is that you can't have a military victory in Afghanistan"); Mr. Cherne: "I think the Soviet Union knows that it has lost this war. You know that I'm not given to optimism. I wish I were. I would be very depressed if I thought we would be sitting here a year from now facing this situation." (In the event, while the Soviets started pulling out the following summer, George Bush had been inaugurated before they finished--and at that the story wasn't over; see Firing Line s0831.)</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Courter is an ardent advocate of the Space Shield. At times their ardency bursts into shrillness, but mostly this is an exciting and instructive hour. JC: "We and the Soviet Union do not mirror-image each other.... The Soviets will use [on-site] inspection for the gathering of intelligence. We'll use inspection for the purpose of corroborating their compliance with arms-control agreements." GL: "Arms control as we've known it... has been singularly unsuccessful.... They meet over there in Geneva, and they come out...[and] say: We have agreed that we will build no more square weapons, no more round weapons, and no more triangular weapons. That's seen as a challenge, then, to the engineers and the scientists and the militarists to build tetrahedrons."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This had led in turn to a beefing up of the American naval presence there, and some of our ships had been fired on. So: "Should President Reagan go to Congress for permission to continue?" A brisk and informative discussion. SS: "If there's any one lesson we should have learned from the war in Vietnam, it's that in order to sustain a military presence abroad, we need the support of the Congress and the American people at home." WFB: "Which we didn't have." SS: "Which we didn't have then, and which I think the President does have now, but it's important to send that signal to our friends and foes in the region."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Coffin: "I would use moral leverage to insist that it's a great mistake to fight evil as if it were something totally outside of yourself. I think self-righteousness is the most immoral position nations can take." Mr. Pipes: "Why are you insisting on blurring the moral differences between systems, between ways of life, between ideologies? There surely are profound differences. It doesn't mean that one is all good and the other's all evil, but on balance there are enormous differences and I don't see why one has to blur these differences to be moral."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This broad and deep discussion includes the right relation of religion and politics, the nature of worship, and the meaning of true ecumenism. RJN: "What we're moving to is a genuine pluralism, which is not the pluralism of pretending that our differences make no difference.... That's shallow, superficial, and it's finally dehumanizing ... I mean, you can dress it up in all kinds of humane, liberal, caring, compassionate language, but what it's really saying is that I don't take you seriously, and I don't take seriously most particularly what you think is the most important thing in your life: namely, your relationship with God, the meaning of your existence, and your eternal destiny."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A fine discussion of INF (intermediate-range nuclear forces) and related matters, generating both heat and light. Mr. Perle: "One reason why I hope there will be a serious ratification debate is that we have not taken arms control very seriously for a long time. People stand up and cheer any treaty, the concept of a treaty, agreement for agreement's sake--and that, I think, is very damaging. It leads to sloppy negotiating.

Now, would you concede that we have very conspicuous abusers of capitalism right now?" MSF: "Oh, no question. I don't know that they're worse now than they ever were, they're just on a larger take basis, they're dealing with larger sums--Mr. Boesky and Company.

Clear cut. No doubt about it." JZ: "But Israel is involved daily in the destruction of the Palestinian national identity, occupation of Palestinian land, the deportation and expulsion of Palestinian leaders." ... WFB: "If France was prepared to receive the president of West Germany four or five years after the second of those terrible conquests, and if we could receive the people who actually bombed Pearl Harbor, it seems to me that one could hope historically that there might be some means by which the essential requirement of both peoples could be met."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

You want to destroy the FBI, for instance. Why?" RP: "Well, we could point out, first, that the first 125 years of this country existed without an FBI. That came about, I believe, during the First World War. The CIA is a really recent phenomenon, 1947." WFB: "Well, we existed 125 years without an airplane, too."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Buckley and Novak for being, as Mr. Buckley puts it, "susceptible to the argument of moral equivalence; namely, that there are not important moral differences between the two contending blocs pursuing a cold war." Here they have as a foil Father McBrien, who does not by any means agree with his Pope on everything but does agree with him on this question. WFB: "[The Pope] said it is insufferable that people should be suffering from a lack of food anywhere in the world, while in the Midwest they are destroying food. Now I think it is insufferable morally, but I know of no way to avoid that problem. I really don't." RM: "You know what you've done, though? As a theologian I recognize what you've done, and I think it's absolutely legitimate. You've just made a distinction between a moral principle and its application."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Each has excellent arguments, vividly presented. Do we make laws for everyone with the 12-year-old in mind? Does the War on Drugs turn people into criminals, or were a majority of users of illegal drugs criminals first? Has the War on Drugs actually--and contrary to what is often asserted--reduced the number of addicts in the United States?

As Mr. Buckley gives the background: "In Dade County, Florida, in 1987, the average malpractice insurance premium for doctors was $165,000 per year. That was up, in four years, from $30,000. In Palm Beach County ... malpractice insurance for obstetricians ... added $700 to the delivery cost for a baby. Enough, finally, was enough." Doctors walked off the job, until the legislature passed a bill altering the malpractice law. Mr. Montgomery tends to see doctors in these cases as entirely in the wrong; Dr. Fischer returns the compliment concerning lawyers. Still--thanks largely to Mrs. Musgrove--we do get an idea of the points at issue.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Fumento is a serious student of the spread of the disease, and while his findings are far from uncontroversial (he was working on a book to be called The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS), he has the facts and figures in hand for this perhaps surprisingly low-key discussion of a highly emotional topic.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Haven't you invited the same charge to be made against yourself? Because before the New York primary you said that under President Jesse Jackson the country would be broke in three weeks and defenseless in six. A few days later, you said that if it came to that alternative, you would vote for candidate Jackson against candidate Bush on the grounds that a President Jackson would do 'less damage' to the country than a President Bush. Were you suggesting that under President Bush the United States would be broke in less than three weeks?" And we're set for the usual delicious mix of substance and chutzpah. EK: "... regrettably, what I did was to use words that were too sharp. Jesse Jackson is more than a candidate, he is an emotional symbol to large numbers of our population, and they did not want to hear my commentary, or did not want to hear the sharp rhetoric."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Perhaps even more startling, the Pinochet regime agreed, and the system has been a fabulous success. Mr. Pinera explains why, lucidly and engagingly, also explains why it would be a good idea here, and talks about the prospect of re-establishing democracy in his country. One sample, which takes on a haunting resonance in the light of the campaign launched against Augusto Pinochet eight years after he stepped down as president (see Firing Line s01190): "Basically, what the military has said is: Look, in 1973 there was this Marxist government; they were violating the constitution, it was like a tiger going around creating problems. People asked us to mount the tiger. We have mounted the tiger. We have dominated the tiger. Now we ride to decide how to dismount the tiger without being eaten."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As the hour plays out, Mr. Adler spends more time-as engagingly and cogently as always-on education in general and some of his own concerns in particular, though when he turns to his fellow philosopher he is illuminating: The two great political philosophers that Bloom admires most are Plato and Rousseau, and neither is a democrat in my sense of the term.

As it happens, each of these guests is something of a Johnny One-Note (Mrs. Gore: "We have to show that we respect the First Amendment and artists' rights ... but at the same time be sensitive to young children." Mr. Simmons: "The record industry ... would love to get rid of [heavy metal].... Why worry about it?"), but Mr. Buckley is on top form: "To whip up community sentiment, whether it's against acid rain or against child abuse, is a legitimate function of social invigoration, and to suggest that because you might stumble into something that was intended to be artistic is to ask for a kind of protection that you can't legitimately hope for.""</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

(Most of the running-mate discussion is on the plausibility of Jesse Jackson, though Mr. Maslin does mention Lloyd Bentsen as a strong contender.) MG: "One point I would like to make, if I could, that we are leaving out of this equation: ... Democrats are frustrated because they have been out of the White House 16 of 20 years, and are extremely united behind Dukakis because they don't want a Reagan successor. Therefore, there will be very little moaning if Dukakis picks someone that's not ideal, unlike the Republicans, who are already complaining that Governor Tom Kean is the keynoter [at the convention], and you have Republicans like Howard Phillips and Richard Viguerie bitterly attacking Reagan and Bush. I don't think you will see that phenomenon in the Democratic Party this year."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Farer takes a laid-back, laissez-faire view of the Soviets' potential installation of missiles in Latin America ("We have the means to act directly and immediately to deal with it, which ... makes it very unlikely that it would be attempted"), Mr. van den Haag takes a more pre-emptive view ("It may not be a reasonable thing for the Soviet Union to place nuclear arms in Cuba, but they did it. And I see no reason to believe they may not act equally irrationally in some Central American republic.... We should be ready"), and Mr. Buckley keeps them on track ("One can't reasonably assume that the Soviet Union is going to invest a billion dollars a year in Nicaragua, which I am told has been done for the last four years, unless they intend to do something other than to Bolshevize the bananas").</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Dr. Grinspoon would legalize drugs but tax them heavily, to pay for the social costs of drug use; Mr. Buckley was developing his "federal drugstore" idea, to provide drugs cheaply enough to get organized crime out of the business, but in a regulated fashion; and Dr. Szasz calls any sanctions "scapegoating." One sample: TS: "Let's take some heroin addict who, at age 25, ODs. Look at the amount of money he has saved society by not being on welfare for the next 60 years, and not being in jail and not mugging people." WFB: "But suppose he wasn't going to be on welfare.

What we have done in our society is to separate puberty from marriage by ten to fifteen years with no corresponding ethic to tell young people how to deal with sexual energy ... Do you think they're going to refrain from sexual activity? I think they're not, and therefore I suggest that we find a way to enter into that world and provide a relationship that can be a committed relationship and have an aspect of holiness about it"). Pastor Neuhaus does not pretend to take a detached view ("Why do you want to take a Christian position when the argument of your book is that there is nothing normative about the Christian Scriptures or the Christian tradition?").

Was the secret of his success a "laudable politics of inclusion"? Or was it--as some Republicans protesting his choice as keynote speaker argued--that he was a Democrat in Republican's clothing? Or was it simply his personal attractiveness, which comes through clearly on this show? A low-key but interesting discussion of a moderate's views: "I found a simple fact, and that is that crime is much greater in the black community than anywhere else in the state, so if you stress law and order, blacks are just as concerned about that if not more concerned than anybody else."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Some had expected the Rehnquist Court to take the opportunity to modify the "New York Times rule" on libel suits involving public figures, but instead of softening the rule it held that obvious satire does not constitute "reckless disregard for the truth." This show offers a crackling debate on the whole subject of civil liberties versus individuals' rights. JF: "Had the ad been of Harriet and her mother or father, I rather think she might be sitting where I'm sitting today rather than there defending the issue." WFB: "No, actually she wouldn't, because Harriet is a very principled woman, and she would, I think incorrectly, feel that this was a sacrifice necessary to sustain the vitality of the First Amendment."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Callahan starts from the fact that a tremendous amount of money is spent on medical procedures in what proves to be the last year of a patient's life. He also points out that, "by constantly trying to extend lives and find more and more ways to apply the technology to the elderly ... we're not getting a happier group of elderly, we're getting an elderly more fearful of growing old and more fearful of death." He finds the expenditures essentially unfair to the young and would "set limits"--apparently an arbitrary age--after which certain procedures could not be done. Mr. Etzioni fairly sputters with indignation but makes some good points about allocation of resources. We may not wind up completely agreeing with either, but we will be left with a great deal to think about."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Our extremely knowledgeable guests are worried but non-apocalyptic. JFP: "There was a time when there was a certain opening of France towards the Soviet Union. This has changed. There is a lot of reluctance, a lot of caution in assessing the Gorbachev experiment. Our feeling is that a close coupling with the United States is necessary for our defense, although we have a deterrent, want to keep it, and want to modernize it."NW: "I think that the French have become the most anti-Soviet people in Europe."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What should the United States be doing? According to Mr. Roett, "The Nicaraguan situation needs to be looked at in the context of 1988-1989, not in the context of President Reagan's inauguration, when he himself took on the Contras as a very personal cause. He is finished; they, too, will soon be finished." To Mrs. Purcell, "When you set up a negotiating process between one side that is heavily armed by the Soviets and the other side that really doesn't even have food and boots, it is a very unequal negotiation." Mr. Buckley, taking issue with Mr. Roett, asserts that "There is no such thing as a nice clinically, hygienically, hermetically sealed Soviet satellite in Central America." Heat but also light on this subject of protracted American consideration.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This week we have Quayle under glass, but on the other hand we had fried Geraldine Ferraro much worse when she ran for Vice President." ...

The Republican Party made a great mistake in that we said: 'Okay, they've got it, we don't need to try.' Well, we're not saying that any more.... We don't need to alter what we stand for, we need to sell what we stand for").</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One sample: MK: "Mr. Buckley ... were you saying, and I hope you were, that the Republicans ought to try to get black votes by telling black voters, 'Listen to Charles Murray; we want to cut off all your social welfare, and it'll really be good for you'? You recommend that as a political strategy?" WFB: "Well, it's obviously useless as a political strategy, because it would be no more useful than if I were to tell you to start going to church every Sunday. You would deeply resent it, even though it would do you a lot of good. But I do think that slowly there's got to be a penetration."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

I mean, I've been in a number of forums with Jews talking to blacks and it is striking to me still the kind of patronizing tone that Jews bring to those dialogues very often.

RS: "I don't think this Pledge of Allegiance issue [Governor Dukakis had vetoed a bill punishing schoolteachers who failed to lead their charges in the Pledge] has much to do with liberal or conservative." WFB: "It's part of a syndrome.... [Dukakis] is so clearly on the side of that part of the Court... which seeks to attenuate the responsibility for inculcating civic--and it used to be also religious--values, that I can't think of anything more important for people to focus on, as distinguished from what the minimum wage should be, $5.45 or $6.45." RS: "It's probably not important to you what the minimum wage is, but it is important to lots of other people." WFB: "No, because in the long run you're going to get conclusions about the minimum wage based on more fundamental characteristics."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Miller speaks of the Congress of the United States as if it doesn't represent the people. The people elect the Congress of the United States just as they do a President...." JM: "May I ask one question? How much money has your political-action committee spread around on Capitol Hill on this issue [privatization of the Post Office]?" MB: "That doesn't mean you're buying votes! Your party doesn't get political contributions? Political contributions are not being made to Mr. Bush?"

Messrs. Buckley and Kissinger begin there and take us on a brilliantly lucid tour of the current state of arms control and much else. HK: "Arms control, which started about 25 years ago under totally different circumstances, has become an esoteric numbers game which is almost its own purpose and whose contribution to stability and security is growing more and more elusive." ... HK: "If we have seen how Gorbachev has treated his own colleagues on the Politburo--every one of whom that voted him into office has since been purged--it would be rather reckless for us to stake everything on one man." WFB: "Recent polls ... have shown that the majority of Europeans believe that Reagan is a greater threat to the peace than Gorbachev. Now you can dismiss this as an eccentricity or ... some sort of schoolboy iconoclasm, but there are, I think, deeper implications that Gorbachev's road show carries with it a terrible and conceivably even fatal psychological potential."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In this session, we see three segments each from George Bush's and Michael Dukakis's performances, with Messrs. Buckley and Kinsley commenting after each pair. MK: "My main reaction to both [of the autobiographical segments], especially the Bush one, is: I remember seeing them at the time and thinking: 'This is so excruciatingly contrived and phony I can't stand it.' But my standards have really plummeted about artifice in politics since then." WFB: "You now think it's sublime?" MK: "Well, I wouldn't go sublime, but it seems tolerable, which it didn't at the time. I think my standards have sunk quite a bit because of the way this campaign has gone."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Rep. Bryant was the author of a bill requiring all foreign holdings in the U.S. to be registered. Was this the first step towards protectionism? A fast-paced and engrossing show on a topic that many of us might expect to find overly technical. WFB: "I'm trying to get a philosophical fix here before we go into the economics of it. Is it your blanket position that any foreigner doing any kind of business in America ought to have exactly the same license as an American?" JP: "Yes.

The Communist insurgents were still active, and Mrs. Aquino's vice president had recently urged her to step down and call new elections. In this spirited debate, Mr. Solarz argues strongly that "Mrs. Aquino has not only succeeded in establishing democracy and reviving the economy, but in winning the confidence of the Filipino people." SS: "What you have in the Philippine press is the background music of democracy. As someone who edits the National Review magazine, you should be entirely comfortable with that proposition." WFB: "Not if it's atonal. Background music has got to be harmonious for democracy to work."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

CM: "We have tended to [say]... we don't know how people enjoy themselves, we don't know how they get self-esteem, but let's take care of the money and then let people take care of the rest of their lives as they see fit. I think that's only true for a very small segment of the population.... For a great many people, the way they go about providing for their material resources is intimately bound up with their self-esteem, bound up with the way they enjoy themselves, bound up with the way they form their communities, and it has been fundamentally unhelpful to say that we can tie off this one area of life and deal with it independently."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This sometimes painful and often profound discussion revolves around what Ru-486 actually is (an abortifacient or a contraceptive?) and how, therefore, it fits into the abortion argument. HP: "If [a woman] took the pill she would not know whether she had been pregnant or not; therefore, if she had any doubt as to whether she wanted to have an abortion, she would not have to confront that issue...." WFB: "I don't really see how morally you evade the responsibility by cultivating ignorance. If you lean out of your apartment building with a .22 rifle and shoot into a crowd without any idea as to whether you hit anybody, I don't think you're entitled to feel better." ... WFB: "You'd like to make it [abortion] illegal ... but in a society in which it's not illegal, is there a presumption that because it's distasteful you want it to be difficult to consummate?" JO: "I don't want it to be dangerous, if that's the drift of your question. I don't want to punish people who have abortions by making it more likely that they will perish or suffer some dangerous illness."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

He gave rise to a school of thought that effectively undermines the Constitution." ... WFB: "It' s also Oliver Wendell Holmes who says: 'If my fellow citizens want to go to hell, I will help them; it's my job.' Do you consider it his job as a Supreme Court Justice to help the American people go to hell?" ... ML: "I go along with the fact that there are natural rights, but who decides what they are? The Warren Court liberals, Justice Brennan now, Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Harry Blackmun have a very different notion of natural rights--don't they, Walter?--from your notion of natural rights?"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

BF: "If this [the 1986 revision of the tax code] was the big reconsideration of our tax system for fifty years, which is what it was billed as being, we should have used that opportunity to get away from an income tax towards a consumption tax." ... WFB: "It seems to me that if the government goes to you and asks you for $100 from your savings, and then ten years later gives you $110, but [it] can only buy you what $45 used to buy you, somebody has swindled somebody without having to answer to the SEC ..."

WFB: "The reason I don't dwell on Quayle is that the gravamen of your case doesn't rest on his shoulders." AS: "It's pre-Quayle." WFB: "...But you'd like to adduce Quayle to fortify your argument, wouldn't you?" AS: "Why not? ... The selection of Quayle brought as much dismay to the Republicans as it brought glee to the Democrats." ... AS: "Originally the Constitution only provided that the Vice President, in case of the death, removal, resignation of the President, should inherit the power and duties of the office, but not the office itself. John Tyler staged a constitutional coup in 1841 when he seized the office. John Quincy Adams wrote at that time, 'Contrary to the views of the Constitution, we now have as President of the United States a man who was never intended for that office.' "...

The show suffers from Mr. Fox's tentativeness as a debater, but we still learn a lot. In Mr. Buckley's summation: "Let's by all means say to the government: Find out what's going on. And say to the scholars: Find out what did go on, and attempt to distinguish between the two.

In the second place, Chernobyl is a reactor that's totally unlike any reactor we have in the United States.... Chernobyl is a terrible example. Three Mile Island is a good example." WFB: "On Three Mile Island you would make the point that after all there wasn't a meltdown, and therefore, what?" JBB: "It was an economic disaster, but it was a technical wonder.

Today's conversation doesn't always connect, but there are interesting bits along the way. Father Maholy: "If at any time I became convinced that Father Junipero Serra was not a saint in his own day and in his death, I would have asked to be relieved of the job, because there are too many valuable things to be done and important things to be done." Mr. Buckley finds it, well, outrageous that an "Ad Hoc Serra Outrage Committee"-- according to a newspaper headline, of "Indian and leftist and atheist groups"--was presuming to tell the Church who was and wasn't a saint.</p><p> Availability: On archive.org.

Mr. Horne had been named his official biographer--but with the stipulation that his book not appear until after Macmillan had died, which he had done, at the age of 92, in late 1986. One sample from Mr. Home: Macmillan felt passionately about the Falklands and said he wished he were still there in power. He wrote to Mrs. Thatcher and said: "Can I be of any help, just give you support in the country? Though the country was not divided as it was over Suez. To his amazement she called him in, and he was there for two hours. She actually asked him how to run a war and, in fact, took all his recommendations.

NS: "In World War II, if... George Patton gave you a briefing on what was going on in the Battle of Normandy, it bore a pretty good relationship to what was happening. Suddenly, in Vietnam, you were in a situation where ... you were seeing one thing when you went out in the field, and the command [in Saigon] was telling you another--and you were trying to reflect the truth.... We thought as reporters our duty was to report the truth about this war so that the President would change policy and win the war." ... RC: "You've had the experience and I've had the experience ... of hearing people blame the press for losing the war in Vietnam. It's an argument that I totally reject...." WFB: "I think that the press became anti-Vietnam partisans, and to suggest that the press didn't influence domestic attitudes is to undermine the power and the prestige of the press.

Since the guests on this show are considerably closer to one another politically, we don't get the fireworks that the Special offered, but we do get a solid grounding for the American audience. Mr. Welsh's opening question sets the tone: "Now, Mr. Buckley, I'd like to ask you whether, in general, the American public knows that there is quite a live, vital, liberal opposition to apartheid in South Africa by whites." Mr. de Beer: "I submit to you that what unites black people in South Africa today is the common experience of oppression, and the day they cease to be oppressed, they will be at least as fragmented among themselves as the white people are now." ... Mr. Worrall: "Democracy is a very delicate plant. We know this. I mean, South America, much of Asia-democracy hasn't grown easily. We're fortunate in South Africa in this respect, that we have certain advantages. We have a parliamentary tradition which is very well established. We have a very well developed legal system, a proud legal system, an excellent judiciary with independent judges. And we have a reasonably highly developed economy by African standards. So those are all factors that work in favor of democracy."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

I'm simply saying that one needs to understand why it is that organizations which in all other respects are democratic, are committed to a democratic ethos-that organizations like those have found themselves in a position where they had to take up arms.

As Mr. Olle frames the question: "Australia is one of the world's misfits. Physically, of course, we're part of Southeast Asia, but psychologically, emotionally, ever since whites' settlement some two hundred years ago, the bonds that bind have tied us to ... the Motherland, Great Britain. And ... we tended to contrive an immigration policy aimed at preserving a white Australia, a fact that conveniently ignores forty thousand years of pre-occupation by Aboriginal Australians." ... GB: "I think that a country which sees itself as the defender of the free world but can't control its own borders is not necessarily a country sufficiently in charge of its own destiny to give assurance to its allies." ...

I would like to think that I would suppress any opinions of my own that differ from Mother Teresa's and I propose, therefore, to be inordinately, gratefully quiet as we listen to her." Some of what we duly hear is what we might expect from this holy woman ("We deal with the lepers, we deal with the dying, we deal with AIDS.... It is an opportunity for the people to share in the joy of loving"), but there are also surprises: "Once I met a lady who was in terrible pain of cancer, and I told her, 'This is but the kiss of Jesus, a sign that you have come so close to Jesus on the cross that he can kiss you.' And the lady, though she was in such great pain, she joined her hands together and said, 'Mother Teresa, please tell Jesus to stop kissing me.' "</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

CWW: "If you only went on what was politically realistic, the Falklands would belong to Argentina and probably NATO would be confined to somewhere west of France ... You can't just look at things that seem to be politically impossible or military impossible and then shrug your shoulders and give them up." ... "We can dismantle and the Soviets can apparently dismantle. They can take these 500,000 troops out and they can turn them into farmers and say, 'You go work in the wheat fields.' But in 24 to 48 hours they can have them back in uniform armed and trained again, and we can't do that. We would debate such a change for ten or eleven years."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

I don't think she was wrong about Bach, but I am very much afraid that she overestimated the musical curiosity of our youth, since, as I look out of my window, I don't see students in Tiananmen Square clamoring for more Bach." The conversation this time ranges delightfully from--once again--affinities between rock and Bach to the differences between performing earlier centuries' music on contemporary instruments and performing it on modern instruments: "There's a certain exoticism in seeing and hearing, say, an early-18th-century instrument ..., and although it's tremendously important for musicians to know them ... we are negating our 20th century altogether and erasing our present selves."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Now, play that on your piano as follows. We'll test it as a proposition. Think the opposite: 'We ought not to seek what is really good for us; we ought to seek what is really bad for us.'

And that's what the First Amendment is about." ... WFB: "May I make a confession? I frankly don't much worry about the flag issue, but here's what I worry about tremendously: that is our disposition to say, 'If the Supreme Court says it's so, it's so.'

Would it go further yet in its next term, in which it had agreed to hear three more abortion cases? This is an exciting though not always coherent show, as the combatants occasionally all talk at once, but light as well as heat is generated. MK: "Are you really prepared for the full legal implications of the position that all fetuses, even two-minute-old fetuses, have every human right that you and I have?" ... WFB: "We're entitled, are we not, to say there has been a certain evolution in moral thought during the past two hundred years? The Declaration of Independence is a morally historic document, and so is the Emancipation Proclamation. And it seems to me that in the past 75 years there was a feeling that not only did the mother have rights, but so did the unborn child."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

WFB: "I'm not equating them; I'm saying there are things in common, namely an evolutionized moral attitude towards that institution."

In this tribute to an old friend and adversary--the third such tribute on Firing Line, the others being to Allard Lowenstein and Clare Boothe Luce (Firing Line s0415 and s0770)--Messrs. Buckley and Kinsley reminisce and comment on clips from Mr. Harrington's Firing Line appearances. From WFB's summation: "Michael Harrington is a marvelous example ... of the extent to which the rhetoric of social gentility tends to help the left-winger. He reaches to Adam Smith for a quote that says, in effect, even the father of modern conservatism can care for people. Conservatives have never, I think said that people should not care for other people, with the possible exception of Ayn Rand, with her war on altruism."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WvR: "No, I didn't say it was synthetic. I think the scenario is good. I don't think it will be carried out.

Mr. Flanigan's organization puts together poor students and sponsors who not only pay for them to go to private (mostly parochial) schools but also serve as mentors. Guests and host are agreed that the public schools are a mess; the question, in this provocative discussion, is the best and most politically feasible way to fix them. ML: "There is a movement now in this country for public-school choice [choice of schools, but limited to public schools]. I regard this as a big banana peel. Some conservatives favor it because they think it has some resemblance to the free-enterprise system, but the notion that you're going to get the benefits of free enterprise from choices offered by a public monopoly, I think, is ludicrous on the face of it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Reproductive Health Services (see Firing Line s0825) was a case originating in Missouri, where our guests have been longtime combatants. Although the topic is hot, the discussion here is civil and insightful. SHL: "Over and over you see the majority of people ... particularly if you're focusing on Missourians-believe abortion is wrong.... When it comes down to specific restrictions they may be in favor of abortion for rape or incest or the hard cases, but when it comes down basically to abortion as a backup for birth control, the majority of people are opposed." ... FS: "Before Webster you had the pro-choice forces who enjoyed the status quo and were clearly the 'ins.'...It's easier to mobilize and energize those who are on the 'outs,' ... and that was the 'antis.' This is the very first time in 16 years ... that both sides have fielded teams.

The Soviets had made a big show, back in February, of withdrawing their troops (see Firing Line s0759)--but since then, as Mr. Tomsen tells us, "they have been massively supplying their puppet government in Kabul--It's the biggest Soviet airlift since World War II." ... HK: "We have a country that's divided into so many ethnic groups and so many tribes and so many political parties--there are eight political parties in the coalition government in Peshawar--there are bound to be differences.

On this show we look at American education through the prism of Mr. Hutchins's ideas about it. HAS: "Hutchins took the position that the distinction of American education that set it apart from that of the older universities on the continent was that we had no ruling class here, and the problem was to educate every citizen to perform effectively in a democratic society.... It was an article of his faith that any child above the level of moron could be educated. And he felt that the burden of educating children who came from diverse backgrounds, particularly those who came from inferior backgrounds, rested upon the educator."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The first of these issues is civil rights: "You voted with 21 other senators against the civil-rights bill. Do you have reasons to regret that vote?" BG: "I still agree with my vote, that you have the right to rent your house to whoever you damn please-black, white, green, or purple."

WFB: "It began with a letter sent by the manager of this orchestra--some people suspect he was drunk when he sent it--but in any event, he asked me if at any time in 1989 or 1990 I would consent to play a harpsichord concerto by Bach with this symphony orchestra. I read it a dozen times wondering whether he were serious, and ... well, you get sort of a Walter Mitty rush, and here I am." ... SC: "If you name the three oldest continuing orchestras in the world, two of them are American. This always startles people, but it happens to be true. I'm not now talking about orchestras in Europe like the Gewandhaus or the Leipzig or whatever that have come and gone and come and gone.

John Silber has elicited all of these flattering comparisons"). Here, he is consistently interesting on the modern American academy. Two samples: "There is no way to make ideas safe for students. You have to make students safe for any and all ideas." ... WFB: "Would you consider it reason for disqualification if somebody were in fact a Marxist--i.e., would you not hire a Marxist?"

Is it because of "the cool resources of very bright people" determined "to render the law nugatory"? In this return visit by one of those very bright people, we get an illuminating discussion of crime and capital punishment. MT: "For every Ted Bundy you point out, where the process took so long, we find that there are three or four people who are in the seventh or eighth or ninth year, and all of a sudden a competent principal lawyer gets a hold of the case and finds that there's some reason there that this penalty ought never to have been given." ... WFB: "The lawyers have [made it]... an almost impossible epistemological question to establish basic guilt or innocence ... This makes a travesty of the law and a travesty of the democratic process."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In this fascinating session, Dr. Nuland informs us of the centrality of animal research to virtually "all research as we have known it in biomedicine in the 20th century"--from vaccination to heart surgery--and he and Mr. Buckley discuss the moral context. SN: "There's a difference between ... animal welfare and ... animal rights. The difference, of course, being: Do animals have rights in the true theological, moral, philosophical, sociological sense as human beings do, or do they not?" WFB: "I would say animals have no rights, but we have an obligation not to amuse ourselves by treating any animal sadistically or wantonly."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This rich discussion disposes of the simplisms and places war in its full context. PF: "I really wrote the book for younger people. I wasn't aware ... that I would get so much flak from people my age, because I thought it was fairly obvious that I thought the [Second World] War was a war in a good cause and a necessary cause. Obviously the Nazis and the German armed forces had to be destroyed. No question about it." "I was trying to make it impossible for people to talk again about body counts,... as if the people being killed were not human beings with, forgive the expression, souls, no matter how loathsome or offensive. I killed a great many Germans, and I doubt if I killed a single Nazi, actually.... Even in a good war you have to do terrible things." "I don't really object to war, in a sense.

Mr. Cousins is careful here not to overstate his case ("It would be a mistake to encourage people to believe they can ha-ha their way out of any serious illness"), but he maintains--genially, and from the perspective of the informed layman--that how doctors treat their patients in the human sense can be nearly as important as how they treat them medically. NC: "The question is not whether we should tell [the patient] the truth, but how do we tell the truth? This is where the doctor's art comes into play. You can tell the truth in a way that will devastate a person and actually impair the environment of effective treatment, or you can tell the truth in a way that challenges."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

"They're going to be surprised, most of the people [in Eastern Europe] that think ... all they need to do is vote and then they have an economy. It's going to be disappointing. But I think the West is going to be surprised by the degree to which, when people are freed--and most of those people have had an education; they're not coming from centuries of blackness and darkness and chaos.

Defeat doesn't seem to have dampened his spirits, on anything from the ACLU ("I liked them when they supported the rights of other people to advocate whatever they wanted to ... But [then] they became ... advocates of the bizarre ideas") to the difference between ethnic pride and racism. WFB: "Bloc voting is in part the kind of ethnocentrism which doesn't offend us ... But ethnocentrism which is really a reflection of hostility to the other race is something more ... Now what kind of ethnocentrism was it that brought Mr. Dinkins in? Both kinds?"

He proves here to be a likable apologist from the Evangelical point of view, dealing with-even if not managing to solve in half an hour-questions such as the problem of pain and the sense in which the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible are true. "We can only embrace by faith what we understand at least in part by the mind. This is when Augustine says that rationality is a necessary precondition for authentic faith. A faith without rationality he defined as credulity, and I agree with him. That's where superstition comes into religion, and there's a great deal of that."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

If you could just install a czar or a king in Moscow it would not solve problems.... What has to be recreated is something that has been partially lost... It's a national feeling, a feeling of pride, historical pride, national pride ...

WFB: "Yes, I understand that, but at the same time I simply decline to think of you as entirely passive... I believe that you do get indignant.

The mystery is how the country not only survives but prospers when "it seems to violate all the rules": it has four official languages, its cantons make their own laws, and "it is the most militarized country in the West in terms of per-capita obligations, and hasn't fought a war since the days of Napoleon." It's easier to ask than to answer; M. Freymond is doubtless right in saying, "You have to explain that through the history. Switzerland is the oldest system of collective security in the world--seven hundred years. And it has worked." Mr. Galbraith adds the banker's perspective: Switzerland has "a long tradition against protectionism," "a bank secrecy ... which is enforced by criminal laws," and a combination of "hard work and capital." All in all, a pleasant tour of this lovely country.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

An article in Mr. Kinsley's magazine had said this was the wrong direction: the answer was to permit "gay marriage." After a lively discussion of the new modalities, Mr. Buckley speaks on behalf of old-fashioned common sense: "Permit me to be square enough to say that one of the problems we face today ... is the problem of the broken family, and the problem of the broken family has to do with a feeling of only tangential loyalty when people live together. Eighty-three per cent of the people who were born in the Bronx the year before last were born to single-parent households. Now it may not significantly change that situation to restore the old orthodoxy, but I should think it would move in that direction."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The city of Amsterdam, as Mr. Kinsley reminds us, had decriminalized possession of marijuana; Britain had a policy (partly abandoned) of giving maintenance doses of heroin to registered addicts. Mr. Gazzaniga has the facts at his finger tips and gives us a detail-filled counterpoint to the recent Firing Line debate on drugs (See Firing Line FLS107): "You have to remember the magnitude of the problem was slight [in Britain] compared to the United States. In 1968 there were only 2,000 [heroin] addicts in all of the UK, while probably in New York at that time there were 150,000.

McDonald's hamburgers and American nuclear bases." ...

But he had spent the intervening years thinking deeply about the role of monarchy in the late 20th century, and this show proves as instructive as it is moving. MK: "Mr. Buckley,... a lot of people may be thinking you're verging on conscious self-parody here. Are you actually a monarchist? ..." WFB: "In respect of America I'm a republican with a capital R and a small r. I don't, however, feel that it's ever correct to assume that the cultural institutions that are natural for a particular country are natural elsewhere." ... King Constantine: "The tremendous success of the king and his two prime ministers ... in restoring democracy in Spain is a wonderful example of what can be achieved in countries like mine."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In 1973 her family had her committed to a mental institution as a manic-depressive, and her story since, recounted in her new book, was one of doubting her own sanity and finally examining the nature of sanity in general. A disturbing and fascinating show.

You should look people in the eye. Your eyes should never waver, because the minute you look away, even if you look away to think, you've broken attention--attention and tension -- You have to look straight in the eye, and at the same time the wavering of the eye can appear to be a lie."

One goal of today's program is to prove him wrong." Whether that goal was achieved is debatable, but it certainly is unusual to hear someone who says, as Mr. Tribe does, "I think it's awfully hard to deny that forcing a woman to remain pregnant against her will, to make a use of her body that she has come to find profoundly offensive,... is a deep assault on her freedom and, indeed, on her equality," also say, "The fetus surely is alive. There's no doubt that it's a member of the human species. Its very helplessness cries out for protection." An unusually thoughtful and thought-provoking discussion of a topic that often incites to a trading of slogans.</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This program offers a genial and instructive conversation about the whole question of support for the arts. Two samples: WFB: "When you consider that the record of the public critics is so dismal--I mean, Van Gogh couldn't sell a single canvas; ninety obituaries were written about Bach, only two of which mentioned that he also composed music--what makes us feel that the NEA is spurring on the kind of critical judgment that makes us satisfied that the money is being well spent?" SC: "Part of the answer is simple: You never know. But because you do not know, I do not think it is plausible to withdraw patronage, which in one way or another has been key to the creation of art." .. . TM: "Patronage has always come with strings.... It's unreasonable for an artist today to think that funds that come from the Federal Government won't have some strings attached."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This show offers a serious discussion of a tangled moral and geopolitical problem. WFB: "We tend to ... [be] so contented by the general evidence that the Communist enterprise is self-discrediting that we assume that... it is everywhere discredited. Unhappily that is a false and optimistic epistemology." ... SS: "We have to recognize that this is a situation in which our influence is at best highly limited.

There's a rabble of ideas ... from the Left, and there's quite an organized and interesting set of ideas from the Right. And I'm not from the Right." ...

That is to say, however intimate Israeli-American relations become, it seems to me only prudent that to the extent that we can get information about Israel that Israel hasn't given us, we proceed to listen for it, and vice versa." . . . DR: "When it comes to operational capabilities, simply getting a job done, I've heard it repeatedly from CIA veterans: 'Nobody does it like the Israelis.' ...

Not all conservatives, though, which lays the groundwork for today's profound discussion. RJN: "In one of the most callous statements ... in the recent history of Court language, he [Scalia] says we will recognize that this will create a certain disability for minorities in our society, namely those that aren't able to muster a majority in the legislature." ... CF: "A lot of countries ... proclaimed freedom of religion--for instance, Revolutionary France and the Soviet Union--and what they meant... was: you're free to be religious so long as you are intensely private about it....

JJK: "I don't know, speaking as a conservative, exactly what I would want a conservative Justice to do. What activism would I ask of him? I'm not sure. . . .

Mr. Kinsley: "Suppose that Bush got Souter into a room before he picked him and said to him, 'Now just whisper into my ear. Would you or would you not overturn Roe v. Wade? ...' Which answer do you think Bush wanted?" WFB: "I don't know, and I'll tell you why I don't know. Because a lot of people who are against abortion are afraid of overturning Roe v. Wade?... They feel it would create, at least for a while, close to a civil-war atmosphere in a lot of states, places like Missouri and Louisiana." ... Mr. Pakenham: "It seems to me that the position you've taken on the decriminalization of narcotics has got to be either true loony libertarianism, which I find hard to scan but am delighted to hear you defend, or it's a very neat way--as is being increasingly perceived by minority leaders--of keeping a troublesome underclass comatose."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Fliegel (who was formerly a superintendent in the New York City public-school system): "You can't allow the bureaucracy to become an excuse for not doing anything....

Fifty-five million people were killed in World War II. We should have prevented it, right? Now if Hussein is allowed to develop a nuclear arsenal, it seems to me that he is of a temperament that simply casts aside normal humane considerations, as he did in Iran ..."

I defy you to travel anywhere except a remote Pacific island to find an atmosphere that's as clean as ours is." ...

REW: "Even though the Reagan Administration sought to eliminate the Appalachian Regional Commission several times, four times on an overwhelming bipartisan vote it was approved. Those were a lot of representatives not from Appalachia, but they recognized the importance of this program and they also recognized how little it cost in terms of what it brought back."

Our guest is, as Mr. Kinsley puts it, "a notorious figure in ... American relations with China." As a Stanford graduate student in the 1970s, Mr. Mosher was allowed to visit a small Chinese village. The reports he brought back--of forced abortion and infanticide--infuriated the Chinese officials and led Stanford to expel him. He here fills us in on the often grim but fascinating story of what has happened since. WFB: "I don't think it necessarily follows that people who are sadists,... even genocidists, can't be charming, do you? I experienced Chou En-lai very briefly, but I did find him absolutely charming.... This didn't mean that I was going to go back home and write that he was other than what I knew him to be." . . . SM: "I don't believe that the [Communist] ideology has a great hold in China today. ... On the other hand, the institutional apparatus of Communism, the oppressive secret police, the use of the army to inhibit and, indeed, if necessary, actually kill people to force them into the political line, that's still very much in place."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB's book Gratitude had proposed a year's national service between high school and college. Fasten your seatbelt and watch these two old comrades-in-arms have at it. MF: "You, of all people ... somebody who's spent his life trying to fight the overgrown government, who's spent his life defending the virtues of individual freedom, of the free market, and here you come up with a program that's the opposite of everything you've stood for all your life." ... WFB: "We live in a society in which young people and older people don't give any evidence of gratitude for what it is that we inherit, and I'm looking for the redevelopment of an ethos that causes people to show that they are willing to reciprocate." MF: "The question is, why is it that we have had so much of a reduction in the sense of gratitude? In my opinion it's primarily because we've been doing so much through government ... and as a result we have destroyed a sense of individual responsibility and responsibility to one another."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

They didn't approve of it, and yet they felt that the cause which Bolshevism represented was in some way progressive, whereas the cause of capitalism was regressive.... So, for example, during the critical civil war, the socialist intelligentsia sided with the Bolsheviks and not with the Whites." ... "There are signs that the right-wing groups [i.e., the hard-liners] are becoming very impatient with all of this [perestroika and glasnost], and it's entirely possible that they will, in the next few months, strike, and by means of a Putsch impose a right-wing dictatorship, with or without Gorbachev" (as in fact they did attempt, eight months after this conversation).</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

LC: "What troubles me ... is that somehow we seem to be talking about bloodlines here. ... In fact, in the United States what is most remarkable is that these ethnic divisions disappear over time, and it is now more common for Eastern and Southern Europeans to marry outside of their group ... And I think that is increasingly becoming true of Hispanics, and we even see some increase in intermarriage rates between blacks and whites." ...

WFB: "And do you predict-" MA: "That in due course people will be aware of the fact that acting and living and using the truths of these transcultural elements in their culture requires them to face up to the inconsistency between what is asserted logically in technology and physics and mathematics, and what they hold in their religions." ... WFB: "If you can foretell the collapse of the non-rational aspects of the religions you cite ... then why can you not forecast a recognition of the truths of religion within our own culture?"

It is Mr. Martin's thesis, backed up by newly declassified British files, that Churchill was deliberately misled by a Communist sympathizer in British intelligence, who convinced him that Mihailovic was a fascist. SS: "Traditionalist conservative figures in nationalist movements are not those with which Americans can immediately commune.... It has always been easier for us to deal with Communists, who were internationalists, who could talk to us in slogans that we would understand."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

He takes as a locus classicus of academic corruption Dartmouth College; the only weakness in this show is that Mr. Spengemann, who defends his institution, doesn't speak up more. When he does, the sparks fly. WS: "I don't understand, Charles. On the one hand you say that students ... are told that nothing is more right than anything else, and then in the next breath you tell us that they're being told continually what's right and what's wrong?." CS: "You have hit on one of the paradoxes, which is that the politically correct approach to these issues begins with the idea of deconstruction--the idea that if we can't undermine the state structures we'll undermine the structures of language. We'll tell you that all beliefs are equal.... But the idea is not to leave a blank slate. It is to clear the field for the imposition of often very, very draconian ideological perspectives."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Two of the shows featuring him, "How Does One Find Faith?" and "Do We Need Religion or Religious Institutions?" (Firing Line s0432 and s0433), had been rebroadcast every year at Christmastime, a tradition that would continue throughout Firing Line's own life. But this masterly redaction brings in Mr. Muggeridge's comments--which are often, as WFB points out in the newly taped introduction, "mischievous"--on much outside the scope of those two session. One sample: "I regard liberalism as the great disease of our society, and when I said that people like Mrs. Roosevelt, admirable though they were in their intention, would be seen to have done more damage than people like Hitler and Stalin, I meant precisely that."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Mr. Solarz was one of a comparatively few congressional Democrats who had voted in favor of going to war, and he uses his position of strength to launch a superb defense of his wounded brethren: "I think it's entirely legitimate to question the judgment of those who opposed the resolution authorizing the use of force in the Gulf. But I think it is ludicrous for some Republicans ... to accuse those Democrats... of representing the party of appeasement."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As Mr. Shogan explains, "What I tried to do ... what I think would be valuable is, since the Presidency affects all our lives greatly, to understand what are the factors that allow Presidents to succeed in certain situations and what inhibits success." Two specifics: Reagan's success with the economy stemmed from the interaction of "his ideology, the feeling that freedom is the greatest good and government is its enemy; his values, his respect for the American past; and his kind of personality, which took so much of the sting out of his rhetoric." LBJ was "a consensual President"--meaning that "He pretended that there was just a common agreement on nearly everything. ... He did that because he didn't want to have to explain himself."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

If we accept his construct, it has major implications for where poor blacks might be on the assimilation curve. NL: "There's a whole theory that I just disagree with, which is: the key to individual economic success is empowerment in American society.... I don't accept the paradigm: Grandpa came to Ellis Island and he became empowered as a hod carrier, and then Dad became empowered as an IBM junior executive. It sounds like a wacky concept to me, and the real question is: Do people get the skills they need and the motivation to get a job and join the mainstream of American society?"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

DD: "When universities practice preferential admissions, and when students ... are outmatched by their peers, there's a great temptation to believe that the reason I am experiencing some difficulty in reading Hamlet by Monday is not because I am not well enough prepared, but is because Shakespeare is a white male." ... DD: "The argument is not that Bach wrote bad music, but that Bach wrote white music, and that in a curriculum that is open to all groups there should be ... representation for other forms of music .. ." WFB: "Yes, but of course that gets into the way of the principal operative axiom of the melting-pot society, which is that people of your ethnic background, and of mine, and of Michael's, and of everybody's in this room, can adapt to a culture and exploit its special resources."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The "political funding" of the title refers to the way government funding is used as a wedge to impose affirmative action on private colleges. That is why Mr. Roche famously established Hillsdale's policy of refusing any government funding. GR: "We had matriculated blacks and women on the Hillsdale campus for over one hundred years before the government took any interest in the question one way or another." WFB: "Back when it was passing the Fugitive Slave Laws." GR: "That's right. In fact, for equal treatment irrespective of race or sex, Hillsdale was the first institution in the United States to formally write that into its charter."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mrs. Cheney is the perfect guide to this debate, outlining what other countries do and explaining the difference between aptitude tests, which attempt to test what the student is capable of, and achievement tests, which find out what the student has actually learned. LC: "Any time you have a high-stakes exam, teachers will teach to it and students will study for it. The point is to get an exam in place that is worth teaching to, that is worthy studying for." ... "When you try to explain to a Frenchman or a Japanese or a German that we test for this thing called aptitude, they're very puzzled that we even think you can test for it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Hollister thinks he has the answer: sea mud. His verve in describing his idea (actually, an idea worked out in a 15-year study by scientists from 8 countries) is matched only by his lucidity in explaining it. CH: "To me the key is predictability. As you correctly point out, the key is going to a place where nothing has happened for the past 60 or 70 million years; therefore the next half-million years looks like a pretty safe bet, because the world is a probabilistic world."... AM: "The Department of Energy has been singularly unsuccessful politically and scientifically in managing nuclear waste. In 1970 they said: We will have a repository in 10 years. In 1982 they said: We will have a repository in 16 years. In 1990 they said: We will have a repository in 20 years."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

For the 25th, the excerpts are triple-distilled into one glorious half-hour, framed by brief comments by Messrs. Buckley and Kinsley. Two of the excerpts remind us that not only does Firing Line comment on events, occasionally it shapes them: the Panama Canal debate may have been a factor in Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980; and it was on the Republican candidates' debate in 1988 that George Bush referred to Pete du Pont as "Pierre."

SZ: "To say that Jordan is not Palestine is just a historical lie ... It was Palestine until 1946 ... That should be a starting point for Palestinian nationalism. In 1947 they rejected that state. In 1967 they used that territory that they said they'd be satisfied with to launch a war. And then they said that the PLO is their sole and exclusive representative, and the PLO is dedicated to the destruction of Israel--and they say so." JZ: "That's not true." SZ: "From that territory, from that land that they were never satisfied with, you want to set up another state. It would be quite suicidal for us to do that.

But where a nominee has set his face against all that black Americans have struggled for for 100 years, he cannot expect them to embrace him. He may go to the Court, but if so, he should go without our imprimatur." ...

Host and guests trade stories about libels here and in Britain, and argue about the two countries' vastly different laws. Mr. Lehmann-Haupt is serenely confident of the lightness of New York Times v. Sullivan; Mr. Buckley, who has both sued and been sued for libel, asks, "Why, if you're elected as a congressman, ought somebody be free to call you an adulterer or a thief?"; and the raffish Taki (who had written a book about his imprisonment for cocaine possession) finds himself on unaccustomed middle ground: "There must be balance. I think that in America the fact that you're a public person and anyone can write anything about you is just as unfair as in England, where you can't write anything about a public person."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

If a Democrat is ever to be elected President again, the party will have to figure out a way to appeal to the South." The two Southern pols who are our guests aren't conceding anything. WFB: "If you have to point to a single problem it's illegitimacy, risen by a factor of 280 per cent in the last 15 years.... Now, licentiousness and permissiveness is associated with the Democratic Party." DLF: "Well, I guess we Democrats do get criticized for being overly concerned with sex, and you Republicans are overly concerned with money--and I don't know who gets the better side of that...." JPR: "You use the term 'domestic agenda,' and that's too political sounding. I'd say the American agenda, when a President walks in ... and talks about illegitimacy in a leadership way.

The resistance was led by Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Republic, and on August 22 the coup collapsed. Mr. Buckley starts off, "We all burst out with spontaneous joy on the 22nd of August: We had won.... Now, between the time of Hiroshima and the time that we won, I went from being a minor to being a senior citizen, and it seems to me that those years in between, relatively painless for me and for you, were climactically painful for millions of people. So we are entitled to ask: . . . From what we now know, how might we have accelerated the demise of this great totalitarian monster?" Mr. Pipes answers straightforwardly: "I don't think we could have done much about that. It had to collapse essentially of its internal crisis. And I think, if anything, we accelerated it by the policies adopted by President Reagan. I would not give him credit for the collapse, but I think he contributed to it by his psychological willingness to stand up to Communism." And we're off on a splendid discussion ranging from the history of Communism around the world to the likely "balkanization" of the Soviet empire.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

To Mr. Donley, that's just fine: "It's a small percentage of the amount of money that the business community spends in retraining people to make up for the deficiencies of the public education.... We're going to have a massive number of experimental efforts attempting to determine in a practical, daily, working world of education whether there are ways to do it better. That appeals to the business community." (Indeed, his Pennsylvania 2000 is part of this effort.) Rep. Pursell doesn't have a great deal to say, but Mr. Donley is quite capable of carrying the ball.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

LBB: "This man [Ted Kennedy] undertook the most scurrilous character assassination campaign against Judge Robert Bork ... These same people ... said: We're going to 'Bork' Thomas.

DH: "The Hippocratic oath is the nonsense of the medical world, devised two and a half thousand years ago by a group of Greeks.... In this age it has no application." ... "I broke the law on two occasions: when I helped my wife to die; when I helped my father-in-law to die. I regretted doing that very much, the actual breaking of the law. I was glad to help them.

SLC: "The President, of course, said that race played no role in the selection process, that Clarence Thomas was the single most qualified individual. I don't think many people took that claim seriously. I think the President probably could have done a lot of work toward binding up some of the racial wounds in America had he said what was probably true: 'There were many outstanding candidates, people I thought would have done a good job, and I used race as one means of sorting among them.'... You know, the President does have a bit of a problem there since he was engaging in exactly what he opposes--" WFB: "That's right." SLC: "--but that's not a knock on Clarence Thomas.... The President seemed to be under the impression that unless he could make a case that race played no role in the selection, there was something wrong with the selection process."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Messrs. Buckley and Glasser--longtime friendly antagonists--argue civilly but seriously, focusing principally on the First Amendment and religion. WFB: "The fanatical interpretation of the ACLU ... is that it is your holy responsibility to protect any human being from the normal pressures that he ought to identify with being a minority. I'm a Catholic; I'm a minority; but it doesn't bother me at all that a Protestant version of the Bible might be used by somebody who says a blessing at an event."

AL: "The real essence of the First Amendment... is the right to disagree with the government.... And I'm confident that conservatives and liberals alike would think that was an essence of democracy." ... WFB: "Hugo Black thought there ought to be no libel law at all. If the Founding Fathers said, 'There shall be no law... abridging the freedom of speech,' then there should be no law.... Why should this right transcend other rights?" AL: "You want me to defend the proposition that it should. But I'm not an absolutist on the First Amendment. I didn't agree with Justice Black, and moreover he didn't agree with himself....

Mr. Osnos stoutly disagrees, and we're off and running. PO: "I can tell you, sitting here as a representative of a major publisher, that it is incredibly hard to get your books, even your best books sometimes, reviewed. . . . The New York Times is inundated with books. There are roughly 45,000 trade books published in the United States each year, and about 5,000 of them can actually get reviewed one way or another in the New York Times.

Here the philosophy is political philosophy, and the bracing discussion centers more on Marx than on Aristotle, and on how the Soviet Union got to be the way it is and what we can hope for in the future. MA: "A capitalist economy, free-enterprise economy, with pluralistic agencies of enterprise, with workers and owners being in the same class for the most part, would achieve a socialist democracy." WFB: "I regret very much the use of the word socialist, because it invokes its own history, and its own history is one of a dogmatic, anti-capitalist position... Moreover, distributive justice has never been understood to be equal." MA: "Not equal now. Remember, the point is: All haves, but some have more, some less.

But it quickly moves into larger issues, because (a) this was taking place on the eve of Quebec's secession referendum, and (b) the Crees and Inuits who live on that land were raising constitutional objections to Hydro-Quebec's plans. This show starts slowly--at least for American viewers, who are unfamiliar with the issues--but quickly picks up steam. Mr. Coon Come: "If Quebec were to achieve its sovereignty, then it must recognize other peoples' sovereignty. If they have that claim, why should there be a double standard?"... Mr. Cote: "The Crees, and in fact all the aboriginals in Canada, are under the protection of the Queen...and I don't think that the Crees will allow themselves to be transferred from one country to another without saying a word."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One such group is feminists, well represented in this fast-moving exchange. CH: "One of the differences between Canada and the United States is that there is ... a general social agreement that sharing some of the risks of life in a communal way, through the state, makes sense. That's the reason that we have the kind of Medicare that we have in this country and you don't have it. That's one of the reasons we have maternity insurance and maternity benefits and various other programs. It's a different culture." ... WFB: "Isn't the discovery of any right also the discovery of somebody else's duty? If you're going to get paid when you have a child, somebody in this room's going to have to put up the money ..." MD: "I want to quarrel with the language of 'discovering rights' as though they're sort of brute facts.

But... in Canada the great political success story... has been the New Democratic Party, the only party in Canada which is avowedly socialist"--although not in the sense we may think, Mr. Rae is at pains to explain. This highly informative show is not the debate suggested by the title; rather, Mr. Buckley and his guest continue the previous show's exploration of the differences between Canada and the United States. WFB: "Could you tell us the extent to which the socialism that you represent is an evolutionized form of socialism, over against the orthodox socialism that we grew up with?" BR: "The word [socialism] connotes many different things ... and the fact that it's been used by Stalinists ... has meant that in North American terms it's not always the most popular word to use. But the evolution that's taken place ... has been a stronger commitment to markets and a commitment as well to social institutions which promote solidarity."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

MH: "The United States would never tolerate the degree of foreign ownership that exists in Canada.... Today, in 1991, there's not one single industry in the United States that's majority foreign-owned and controlled by any non-residents ...; whereas in Canada the automobile industry, electrical-apparatus industry, transportation industry, rubber industry, tobacco industry--I could go on...." WFB: "Money is fungible. Whether a Dutchman owns it or an American owns it is entirely immaterial as far as I'm concerned. All I want is prosperity." MH: "No, you're totally wrong. So much depends on where the profits end up."... MH: "We love Americans in many ways, we admire you, we are fortunate to live next door to you ... but we don't want to be Americans...." WFB: "In the first place I didn't invite you to become an American. However, I married a Canadian and after 41 years she became an American, so we'll give you time to think about it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

AD: "Since the history of your country mandates that there should be the freedom to bear arms ... shouldn't there be an equal priority for the freedom to health care?" WFB: "No. "Why should there be? If it mandates your right to free speech does that mean it mandates your right to free abortions? They're unrelated." . . . EB: "Why can't you use compromise? Why do you have to use force?" WFB: "Because we want to look after you.... Who's going to say to North Korea day after tomorrow, 'You can't have a nuclear weapon.' Canada?" . . . KG: "Would it not be more advantageous to follow the lead of Canadians and be a little more socially responsible in your economic policy?" WFB: "Well, I think in certain respects that's absolutely true. For instance, in Canada there is no ban against using public money in schools or universities that are church-related. I think that's highly civilized."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Breaking the No New Taxes pledge, however, and signing what conservatives called the "quota bill"--the Civil Rights Act of 1991, making it easier to sue for job discrimination--had soured them, and National Review had just printed an editorial welcoming a challenge to President Bush in the primaries. On this show Mr. Sununu does not give an inch in defending his boss. WFB (on the Civil Rights Act): "He vetoes and vetoes and vetoes, and then he yields. Now, he may yield because of what the French call force majeure." JS: "No. He yielded because he won.... The President vetoed a piece of legislation that was quota producing.... When he gets legislation that meets his criteria, he accepts it.... It is a good, non-quota bill." ... JS: "When you take a good, hard look at what George Bush has done in detail, conservatives will begin to understand that this is probably the most conservative President of the 20th century."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

VW: "One of the things that governs in Germany ... is the measure of guilt felt towards different countries. The greatest measure of guilt is felt, I think, towards Poland--justifiably. The second greatest measure of guilt is France--unjustifiably. The French were treated better than almost anybody else who was occupied by the Germans...." WFB: "What about Russia?" VW: "That's where you'd expect the largest one to be, and there's some, but it's a recent phenomenon. . . . When the Soviet Union was threatening and still blockading Berlin and keeping the Wall up they didn't feel any guilt." . . . VW: "Every time somebody in Europe would say to me: 'Why don't you put your financial house in order?' I would say: 'How do you think it got out of order? It got out of order defending you! ... And you Europeans--just remember that we are the only country in history that ever financed its competitors into competition with us.' I know, I was in the Marshall Plan administration and I saw it happen." WFB: "And no regrets?" VW: "I think not, overall. We've won the long war.

A thoughtful discussion on the way our political campaigns are run. WFB: "Do you have any philosophical or political reservations about the coincidence between forensic virtuosity and civic wisdom? Can't you envision a situation where A is clearly a better man than B, but just doesn't quite make it on television? ..." NM: "Well, many people say, Could Abraham Lincoln--he was not telegenic, he was not a good-looking man, they say he spoke kind of slowly--could Abraham Lincoln have been elected in a television age? My sense is that if a candidate is on long enough--let's say if there were three or four debates--the American people are wise enough to size him up. If it's 30 seconds--no. But I think if there's enough of a time period and a chance to see, I think the American people can judge that."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On the tape we just saw, we heard a Haitian man give much the same reason for coming to this country. The Cubans were heralded as defectors, the Haitians were intercepted and taken to Guantanamo. Do conservatives think this policy is moral?" A serious discussion, but one that cannot solve the dilemma that Mr. Buckley describes: "People who make heroic efforts to gain freedom--the boat people in Vietnam come especially to mind--show the intensity with which freedom is something people want, and they ought to be applauded and encouraged. But it's also true that you run into situations ... in which the nature of the existing organism is threatened by an unregulated inflow....

They will not die. The city will not die because it provides something special for us." He and his host discuss the grim topic of potential civicides--welfare demands, labor-management disputes, high taxation--vigorously and entertainingly. EK: "... a table in the New York Times ... showed what the costs were amongst the 50 states for mental health per capita. My recollection is that New York was spending $140 per capita for mental health, and New Jersey, right across the river, was spending $50.

In contrast, this is a civil and productive discussion of why--feminism apart--rape is such a difficult crime to prosecute justly. PJ: "I have heard proposals that we lower the burden of proof in rape cases to something like a preponderance of the evidence, and it horrifies me. It makes me wonder what other crimes and what other classes of people we are going to rule out of the presumption of innocence. .. ." MIC: "Rape in some ways is a different crime ... For one thing there's essentially no other crime where the consent of the victim is a crucial element of the crime.... To say: 'I thought he wanted me to take his money, he was inviting it,' is simply not relevant in robbery cases."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Both guests clearly know their stuff; unfortunately, neither, despite Mr. Buckley's questioning, rises sufficiently above generalities to teach us much we didn't know. LR: "We have, in fact, a double standard. We don't say we do, we don't mean to, but we have it de facto. We have a hidden tracking system that begins in kindergarten or first grade that's very difficult to break and that allows certain children to slide through with low expectations for them."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Like Mr. Botstein (cf. #FLS112, above), Mr. Levy believes we're in a "contained depression"; Mr. Reynolds believes a few changes in the law would work wonders. Both guests give us plenty of specifics to hold onto as we follow them through their arguments. DL: "We try cutting deficits, we try increasing spending, we raise taxes, we cut taxes. One important reason why we keep incurring these huge deficits is ... because the private investment engine is temporarily stalling." ... AR: "Who are we losing jobs to? The unemployment rate is 9.4 in Britain, it's 9 something in France, it's 10 1/2 in Canada.

Good fun even if there aren't many surprises. WFB: "I would like to ask Mr. Clyburn . . . whether it has ever occurred to him . . . that to the extent that you have this unanimity which you have had in the recent past in black reliance on the Democratic Party, which is the statist party, that there might be some overhang there of a plantation mentality. . . ." JC: "I find it very hard to figure out how you will apply an individual remedy to a harm that was heaped upon a group. Now if the group was the recipient of the harm, then it seems to me that it's the group that needs to find the remedy, and the remedy must apply to the group. . . ." AW: "As an African-American, I think that anybody can see that the welfare system that the New Deal put in place -- even the President at the time said, 'I pray to God that it doesn't become an opium to the society' -- I think it's a tragedy that the welfare system has been put in place to the extent that it still exists. Because I'll tell you, it is the worst form of slavery. What you do is you enslave people's minds."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

GM: "Number one, we've got a 7.3 per cent unemployment rate. That makes any incumbent President vulnerable, particularly when you have one who is widely perceived as being vitally interested in foreign affairs and being bored about the domestic problems of the American people." . . . CC: "It would be difficult if the economy went down for any President to do well in the fall, including George Bush. However, I think we need to recognize that the Congress of the United States, particularly the House of Representatives, has been controlled by one party since the early 1950s. And that one party has been a party to the development of all of the programs and the debt of this country because the spending and the taxing start in the House of Representatives."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

He gets no pleasure out of life. He just lies there in bed and stares. Shouldn't we just kill him?" ... FK: "What we have in America on this subject are two overlapping majorities. You've got a majority of Americans who believe that the government should not interfere in the decision of a woman to have an abortion, and that same majority of Americans also is disturbed by the number of abortions ... by the reasons they think women are having abortions, and therefore they do support regulation and restriction of abortion."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

RMC: "In addition to disclosure, it would make a big difference if the directors were really independent--if they didn't sit on each other's boards, if they didn't, indeed, sit on each other's compensation committees, because they all have a stake in raising the level of what each of them gets paid."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Han, discussing past attempts to institute democracy in Asia: "Generally the presidential system has been more difficult to maintain. Either the president becomes dictatorial, as it happened in the Philippines, as it happened in this country, or the president becomes very weak and subject to takeover by the military or other factions. Now we've experienced both of these situations, and I think because we have had these immunizations we have a fairly firm ground for democratic development in the future." ...

So the longing for unification was so much more intense, the anguish of having to live under conditions of division was so much deeper.

Hyun and Gregg agree, in a detail-filled conversation that goes on to examine the current texture of that alliance. Mr. Gregg: "The Koreans have had a magnificent economic success by a formula which is quite interesting, which is strong governmental control from the top, and free enterprise working very vigorously from the bottom.... People like Paul Volcker ... think it is now time for Korea to really free the market,... but like a parent trying to teach a child to ride a two-wheel bicycle, the government is a little reluctant to let go of the back of the seat." ... Mr. Hyun had been in Los Angeles just after the Rodney King riots, in which Korean storekeepers were hit especially hard. WFB: "When you spoke to Korean victims of that lunacy that lasted three days, did they feel that America has betrayed them?" HCH: "Actually there are three kinds of conflicting emotions now prevailing . . . Some of them would like to come back to Korea, the American dream soured; some of them would like to move to a safer place to do business, the suburban areas. But the majority of the people there would like to stay there and to rebuild.""</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Buckley recounts the reaction from Pyongyang: "'The South Korean puppet government has committed a grave provocation, seriously getting on our nerves by fabricating a false report after creating an incident.' It is," comments WFB, "like a time warp with just a little echo chamber in Castro's Cuba." General RisCassi is no polemicist, but he has a quiet authority that gives weight to his assertions. WFB: "Are you free to tell us to what extent our technology permits us to establish whether North Korea is actively engaged in the development of a nuclear weapon?" RR: "I can tell you from all the means that are available to me that we are convinced that they have constructed a facility that will allow them to fabricate a nuclear system within two to three years."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

How, if you're the Republic of China, do you deal with that same country, which wants to place you under its totalitarian regime? A rich discussion of the changes that have--and the changes that haven't--taken place in the People's Republic, and of the best way of nudging Peking in the right direction. JCH: "... at least they probably are no longer proud of themselves being called Communist. In fact many of their economic policies are turning more or less market-oriented.

Then the clouds rolled in: in 1971 Taiwan was expelled from the United Nations in favor of Peking; in 1978 the Carter Administration withdrew diplomatic recognition. But instead of collapsing, Taiwan, as Mr. Buckley puts it, became stronger and stronger, more and more powerful, more and more attractive." This show is an often moving account of how Taiwan reached the point where, as Mr. Chien puts it, "No longer are we talking about mutual defense treaties; no longer are we talking about political alliances; we are talking about trade, investment, environmental protection, technological transfers. In all these fields the Republic of China is a country to be reckoned with."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Sometimes there are language difficulties and Mr. Ma doesn't quite seem to grasp the question he was asked, but mostly this is a fine exploration of the political and economic possibilities ahead, looking towards the time when, as Mr. Rusher phrases it, "Deng Xiaoping is dead, the other older leaders of the Long March are dead, and a new generation has come in, much softer...and serious change is under way there...."

Other parties had been allowed to contest the 1990 election, and the Mainland-born Mr. Hau was Premier to the ROC's first Taiwan-born President, Lee Teng-hui. This is only the second Firing Line in which the guest has used an interpreter (the first having also been from Taiwan, #S309 with then-Premier Chiang Ching-kuo). The result is a slower pace than often, but it's well worth it for the view from this unique vantage point. HP: "Sudden overnight change such as has taken place in the Soviet Union could not happen in Mainland China ... because 80 per cent of the population of Mainland China are farmers. For the past ten years Deng Xiaoping's so-called agricultural village reform guaranteeing income to each household has been quite successful. It has allowed ... a great improvement compared to the days of Cultural Revolution and the People's Commune. But because they are quite cut off from news of the outside world, basically 80 per cent of the population ... are in a stable situation.... This is a basic difference between the reforms of Deng Xiaoping and of Gorbachev."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Under reapportionment, his district had been redrawn with the aim of electing a Hispanic; in the event, he found himself running against five Hispanics. This half-hour starts with the question of whether only a Hispanic can represent Hispanics, only a Jew Jews, and so on, but deepens into a general discussion of the theory of representative government and the way the Executive and Legislative Branches are supposed to play off each other. WFB: "The late Professor Willmoore Kendall... in a famous essay called 'The Two Majorities,' remarks that the role of a Chief Executive is to appeal to certain Utopian instincts or appetites among people, and the role of Congress is to apply mechanical brakes." ... SS: "While I disagree with many of his policies, there is no question that Ronald Reagan was able to effectively push his program through the Congress. I think part of the problem we've had in the last four years is that President Bush simply has not been actively or effectively engaged in the effort to push his domestic program through the Congress."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One sample from Mr. Shrum: "If we were going to be dispassionate I would tell you that what this election reminds me of is the 1980 election. We have a President who has severe economic problems; who appeared to have a big success in the Middle East, which is now a very modified success at best....And the Republican tack here is to assault the character of the Democratic nominee-very similar, I think, to what was going on with Reagan in 1980 when we were being told that he had an unnatural affinity for pushing the button and starting a nuclear war."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

JL: "I would say that family values is part of the social issue, and it is an issue that is not gaining any salience in this campaign, I think because of the excesses of the Republican convention. Chattering about witchcraft and demonizing homosexuals is not the way to present this issue, but--" WFB: "It's a good start, isn't it?" JL: "No, I don't think so. No, I think to have Newt Gingrich jumping up and down about Woody Allen is not the way to open up the family issue." Mr. Gigot concurs: "It began to be perceived ... by a lot of people as, 'Anyone who is a homosexual, for example, is not welcome in our party,' rather than making it an issue that, say, 'Should you subsidize through the tax code somehow, or through affirmative-action programs, the homosexual lifestyle?'" A good-natured and productive conversation that moves from family values to the abortion debate to the way Democratic convention delegates were chosen.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

One sample: WFB: "We went longer than at any time in postwar history without a recession. Now, was this simply the magical accomplishment of Ronald Reagan, or is your profession learning something about governing business cycles that we didn't know ten years ago?" JKG: "That is an important question and I'm not going to attribute further blame to Ronald Reagan, much as I enjoy doing it. We have entered into something that is new, dangerously new, and that is a high-unemployment/low-performance equilibrium. We had that in the 1930s. This is much less serious than it was then, but the notion that there is an automatic recovery process is something that we must now question."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

A collegial and informative conversation, starting with the tax issue. Messrs. Brookhiser and O'Sullivan both date the unraveling of the Bush Administration to the 1990 budget deal--partly because, as Mr. Brookhiser puts it, "the tax policies that they decided on were bad and contributed to lengthening the recession"; partly because, as Mr. O'Sullivan puts it, "you couldn't trust Bush--not for any discreditable reason of personal character, but because [of] the tax issue ... 'Read my lips. No new taxes,' as a lot of people have pointed out, is saying, 'Look, this isn't just another politician's promise. I really mean it.' So when you break that pledge and when you then in addition go on to say, 'Read my lips'--in other words, 'I'm treating your astonishment, shock, and disappointment with contempt'--I think at that point he lost his grip on the character and trust question.

Messrs.

This vigorous discussion helps us focus on just what we mean by "federalism" at the end of the 20th century. WFB: "As an economist, are you worried about the increasing size of the wedge ... which is the difference between what it costs me to hire you and what you get? ... It costs an employer 35 per cent more than its employees get because of Social Security, medical insurance, sick leave, etc.--and that, of course, decreases our competitive mobility." AR: "I think one of the real competitive problems is the high cost of health care in the United States." WFB: "Sure. GM pays more for health care than for steel."

Miss Noonan had written celebrated speeches for both men, including the line "Read my lips"--brilliantly effective at the time, devastating in retrospect after President Bush broke his no-new-taxes pledge. This half-hour offers a stimulating conversation on the modes and substance of presidential public appearances. PN: "I sometimes thought that [Mr. Bush] might have been somewhat traumatized ... He saw in the Reagan White House a great deal of attention being paid by Mike Deaver and Jim Baker to--almost the aesthetics of an event: to the balloons falling; to the Dover Cliffs; to where the President will stand. I think Reagan could look at all that stuff and think: 'Well, here we are communicating, and this is how you do it in a sophisticated world.'

Mr. Eastland's book, subtitled The Case for the Strong Presidency, is the springboard for a discussion which, although polite in tone, goes in substance beyond the level of quarrel" to total war. ML: "I find it rather disturbing that in recent decades conservatives, because they happen to control one branch of government, the Executive Branch, started recycling ... the anti-legislative arguments which the authoritarians in the Weimar Republic, for example, rehearsed. Their argument was: The Reichstag is nothing but a collection of special interests, it's completely corrupt, whereas the President, Hindenburg, or the Chancellor somehow stands above parties ..."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

So one has gone beyond philosophy. The leap of faith is not from less sure grounds for the affirmation of God's existence to more sure grounds, but it's from the affirmation of God's existence to belief in God as benevolent, caring, just, and merciful." WFB: "Your discovery of God was in the nature of an epiphany rather than in the nature of philosophical deduction." MA: "Absolutely." WFB: "But having had that epiphany you then proceeded-I know from a knowledge of your books-to make certain deductions which in your judgment directed thought about God in a fruitful channel, but not necessarily led to His discovery." MA: "No. The leap of faith involves going beyond argument to what cannot be proved, and the sign that one has made that leap is asking God for help." (Note: Mr. Adler would become a Catholic in 1999, at the age of 96.)</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

It's more pious than political correctness. It's more evangelical than any rainbow coalition. The painfully sincere tone and rigidly mandated diversity of this week's inaugural events constitute a frightening new movement in American politics; the Religious Left.' " Mr. O'Sullivan explains this development by reference to an argument by Tom Bethell that "when people stopped believing in God or they lost an old-fashioned secular faith like patriotism or nationalism, there was a vacuum, and people can't stand that kind of philosophical vacuum." Is it, asks Mr. Buckley, " 'Do your own thing,' or is it 'Be your potty little self? Because after all, those come from two distinctly different patrons--Woodstock and Chesterton." Mr. Sobran: "No, this is much more 'Do your own thing.' But the thing you do must be in some kind of conformity with the things that other like-minded people are doing too."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Now, in our century we have seen the vote given to women. Good. We have seen the vote given to blacks. Good. We have seen votes given to illiterates. Bad...." MG: "Why in the world shouldn't illiterates vote? Just because they're not literate or intelligent by your standard? They have interests that are as important to them as yours are to you...." WFB: "I put it once this way ... It was established ... that 20 per cent of the American people had never heard of the United Nations.

Ann Landers provides wonderful insight into American culture, and Ann Landers now and again will print a letter which shows that many wives believe that they live in a state of community property--that is, they do believe that everything that's acquired in the course of the marriage really does belong to the two of them.

Mr. Recchia--a Detroiter whose experience in the auto industry includes stints with Chrysler, Fiat, and Ferrari--takes us on a brisk tour of the worldwide economic scene from the automaker's perspective. WFB: "Why doesn't the market provide cheaper new cars? ..." RR: "In order for you to provide a low-priced car, it really has to have tremendous volume and worldwide appeal. As long as you restrict the number of cars that are imported into the United States, none of the worldwide producers like Toyota are going to spend billions of dollars to produce a low-priced car... So Toyota and all the other Japanese companies moved the type of products that they import into the United States to the higher-priced models. That took the pressure off the domestic industry to answer with a lower-priced car."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

What Dr. Wennberg studies is not so much "overmedication" as the appropriateness of one treatment as against another, and the extrinsic factors in prescription: "The chances of having bypass surgery if you live in New Haven are about twice that if you live in Boston, whereas about 75 per cent more people with arthritis of the hip end up with surgery if they live in Boston than if they live in New Haven"--just because of the biases of the respective teaching hospitals. JEW: "Do you prefer the risks and benefits associated, say, with surgery compared to the risks and benefits associated with drugs? They're very different, and the differences are subjective, and it requires the involvement, the engagement of the patient in the decision process--which essentially flips Western medicine upside down in terms of the traditional roles between the doctor and the patient."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

"I spent some time living in public housing and a lot of time going around to inner-city public schools.

Everyone invited pleaded conflicting engagements, and so we proceed with Mr. Brock." It would have been a more dramatic show, certainly, if the woman who had accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment had taken part; but Mr. Brock is as clear an exponent in person as he is in print, and he reminds us of salient points concerning the Judiciary Committee's hearings on Judge Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. DB: "In my view, most of Anita Hill's supporters would find that almost everything they believe about this case and about Anita Hill is actually false.... We can go right to the question of: The men on the Committee just didn't get it. That is provably false, and I lay out the scenario in my book to show that the Committee actually did ... everything that it could have been expected to do to take the charge seriously."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Blankenhorn is earnest rather than sparkling, but he has a lot to say. "In our interviews we've found the most severe critics of the current welfare system to be the people who are on it.

Won't you begin your generality by accepting an empirical limit on it?" RB: "Not as an ideal." Dr. Abernethy comes along with a bucket of cold water: "Remember, Hong Kong may be much closer to a libertarian society than we are.... We have a government that has undertaken to provide health care, food stamps, subsidized housing, cash payments in the form of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, plus public education... So if we are libertarian in implementing just one policy, and that policy is open borders, we become a welfare magnet for the whole world."

ZB: "If 'Never again' has any moral imperative attached to it, it has to be applied to new circumstances.... If 'Never again' means only that it is applicable if Hitler appears and there are Nazis with swastikas killing Jews in Kristallnacht and thereafter in Germany, then it's never going to happen again. So there is a moral obligation here [in Bosnia]. After all, this is happening in what is considered to be the more civilized part of the world. If legality and decency collapse there, the implications of that are far more consequent than if it happens in those parts of the world where violence is more pervasive and legality is less entrenched." "The great struggle today in Russia is really not between democrats and Communists. It's between those Russians, like Yeltsin, who say that Russia ought to be a normal, post-imperial national state, and those who say: 'No, inherent in the notion of being a Russian is an imperial mission.'"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Not one ever denied a noble reality, an intelligible reality. Kant's Copernican revolution is the worst disaster that's happened to philosophy in modern times, and the professional philosophers accept it without a murmur." WFB: "How do you account for that?" MA: "I'm afraid I have to say something that's cruel. I think they're uneducated. They have not submitted their mind to the literature properly. They haven't read Aristotle properly, they haven't read Aquinas properly, they haven't read Plato properly."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

There are several college presidents in the audience, and some of them accept Mr. Buckley's invitation to break in with questions and comments, bringing other perspectives to an already lively show. The question before the house is why, since 1980, the cost of college tuition has risen, as WFB puts it, "at twice the rate of overall inflation and higher even than medical inflation." RZ: "All the data says that if you want a robust earnings over your lifetime, go to college. There is just no doubt about that. And that's the good news. The other side of it is public policymakers have said, 'If that's true, then let them pay for it.'"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

And Miss Hamrick, a la Mortimer Adler, reminds us that "the mission of a liberal-arts school is not to fill someone's head up with all the knowledge that is there; it's to instill a thirst for knowledge and the techniques of learning."

But this show offers a particularly rich exposition, not least because Mr. Colson had just visited a prison in Brazil that truly rehabilitates, sending out people with a recidivism rate of about 4 per cent. The catch: it's explicitly Christian. CC: "Jack Eckerd, a wonderful philanthropist, spent half a million dollars to explore the feasibility of doing it here and concluded, because of the ACLU and separation of church and state, that we would never be able to do it." WFB: "You mean they might fall in love with God instead of with Mammon, and we wouldn't want to run that risk?"

Are we indeed facing a reprise of the Sand L mess? Mr. Brendsel says not and gives details to back up his assertion. As he explains, although taxpayers' money is involved in Freddie Mac, it is only temporarily so for each mortgage: what Freddie Mac does is buy up mortgages at the low end of the housing market from private-sector lenders, combine a bunch of them from different parts of the country in a diversified package, and sell these "mortgage-backed securities" to private investors. As of this writing, Mr. Brendsel's expectations have been borne out.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The main point at issue: ought "a dictionary to exercise any normative functions"? Mr. Mish answers ably, but this show proves far richer than a mere tussle over "ain't" and "hopefully." WFB: "I remember years ago reading that when Ronald Knox translated the New Testament he took 13 different Greek words and conjoined them all into the single word 'righteous.' In doing so, I was told by this particular critic, he set back ethical research by two thousand years. Now, if there is not a felt need for a gradation of a word, do you rule that the time has come to jettison it? ..." FPM: "We wouldn't jettison anything if it were still in common use or if it had been used in important literary works of the past. You can't take a word out of a dictionary that calls itself 'collegiate' if Shakespeare used it in Hamlet, even if no one has used it since Hamlet."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The events of the day before this taping--Boris Yeltsin had dismissed the Russian Duma--certainly bore him out. This thoughtful discussion ranges from the current fiasco in Yugoslavia--where neither the United Nations nor NATO was able to put an end to Slobodan Milosevic's "ethnic cleansing"--to "the major diplomatic mistake of the 20th century--and that's a field that has a great many major diplomatic mistakes ... : the 1918-1919-1920 period in Russia when we should have helped, obviously on a very large scale, the promising new democratic regime of Prince Lvov and Kerensky to succeed. The Allies, exhausted by the First War, made a few feeble gestures and then retreated and allowed this cancerous development of the Soviet regime to take place."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

D. Laing." Mr. Magnet takes it from there: "The great magic of America is that we rest not on any kind of racial identity, not on the history of a single people, but on the great American liberal democratic idea. And it is being so devalued by talk of how we have a culture which victimizes people, which oppresses people, the thought that all those American values are elitist and racist or sexist... I think what we need to do is restore what was the unique American idea... that anybody who relies on himself, is energetic, will work, and will take care of his family, can be anything he wants to."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Firing Line's previous look at health-care reform (Firing Line s0987-s0990) concentrated on the public policy and political aspects. This series, with an array of thoughtful and cogent guests, concentrates on medical aspects--in this first show, the relative paucity of general practitioners. Dr. Davis: "For me, being an internist meant a variety of things, one of which was intellectual satisfaction in diagnosis, problem-solving, which is one of the traditional hallmarks of internal medicine. But how I found that was in medical school, being exposed to a group of people who practiced medicine." ... Dr. Bowman on the possibility of retraining: "A neurosurgeon who has always been a neurosurgeon I perceive as having more difficulty becoming a primary-care physician than an infectious-disease specialist, for example."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Drs. Sanders and Janeway emphasize portability (the ability to retain your medical insurance if you change jobs) and insurance for catastrophic illness--which, says Dr. Janeway, could be taken care of for "not a huge amount of cost to the American public per year." Dr. Kurad--who was driven out of active practice of his specialty by "the paperwork mill and the hassles with insurance and Medicare"--tells persuasively what business can do to cut the red tape."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

WFB: "Isn't medicine walking into a situation in which it will almost certainly devise terribly expensive technological forms of relief, in which case there is a rationing aspect built into the situation?" WH: "I think one of our difficulties is, in point of fact, that era is already here." ... CL: "Most people in their later years approach the issue of death with one eye on what it will mean for the finances of the family, especially the younger generation." ... MH: "I think it's very clear looking historically that the medical establishment was very reluctant to honor patient requests to not resuscitate or to withdraw feeding tubes, and it took the courts to force the medical establishment to comply with patient wishes. And I think that that has led an attitudinal shift. In fact, the complaint now is that the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction, that now physicians and hospitals are insisting on withdrawing treatment because it's futile under their definition of futility even though the family wants to continue treatment."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

And yet here is Dr. Nuland, who is no Kevorkian or Derek Humphry: "Until about ten years ago, one could literally ask a nurse for an overdose of morphine or whatever it may be and walk to a patient's bedside and put it into an intravenous solution and sit by the patient's bed until the eventual ending had occurred. [Now] everybody has become so conscious of suits--most particularly, interestingly, the nurses. So you can't do that any more....

MK: "Since you've had this program you know many more people than you did before you started it. You've had a parade of felons that would make the average criminal-court judge feel that his calendar was overburdened. But you know them all. I mean, you make a distinction between G. Gordon Liddy and Huey P. Newton... You recognize honor in some people, Bill, and you recognize its absence in others. There are very few people who have honor." "The great aim of life is to have as few apologies to make as humanly possible."

WFB: "A lot of people slept around with JFK and a lot of them kept quiet about it during the summer of 1960, and I think that was probably the right thing to do." SA: "I'm not sure those two examples are comparable." WFB: "It has to do with character. He was committing adultery. If it had been exposed and put on 60 Minutes that he had done so, it almost certainly would have affected the elections." SA: "Oh, certainly. It would have affected the Clinton election as well if Paula Jones had in a timely fashion brought her charges." ... MG: "He's an extraordinary President, I think. You know, a lot of people, Bill, under this pressure would get vindictive and angry. I saw Richard Nixon do it....

The question before the house: "Is President Clinton right in claiming credit for the current recovery?" Or is he simply collecting the legacy of Reaganomics? Mostly the latter, say our guests. Mr. Rubenstein explains how lowering the top tax rate brought money out of shelters into productive use; Mr. Kudlow explains the importance of the huge increase in real net worth among all income categories. But the Reagan years weren't perfect: as Mr. Kudlow points out, "the 1986 so-called Deficit Reduction Act was the source of the stalled economy during the Bush years. The other thing I wish the President had erased was signing on to the 1983 Social Security fix ... because this launched another serious of punitive payroll tax increases which has done a lot to hurt middle-class families, it's done a lot to hurt small businesses, and it's been a big discouragement for jobs."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A delightful and quite out-of-the-ordinary conversation about a topic host and guests all love. One sample, from Mr. Morris: "Music is not necessarily--I am going to choose my words carefully in a way that I hope you will appreciate--it's not so much a competitive art as an emulatory art. And I like to think that in music we ... are spurred on to our best efforts by the best efforts of our colleagues, and therefore, competition, naked competition [as in the Cliburnor Tchaikovsky competitions] is to some extent anti-musical, because it causes you to concentrate only on those elements of music which make a naked appeal to the guts of the audience, and there is a lot more to music than that, as of course you know."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

AH: "I think they would have made it extremely unlikely, extremely improbable. Just take a remark made by General Bradley at midday on the 6th of June--this was after the invasion had been going for less than 12 hours--and he said, 'I think we have an irreversible disaster on our hands,' given the appalling carnage on Omaha Beach. ... I think today you would have had CNN on the beaches, and I doubt if it would have been acceptable to have had a D-Day plus 2. Now ... I met Norman Schwarzkopf and I asked him after [the Gulf War] what his biggest problem was, and he said it was quite simply the media ..."

So he would never allow his mask to drop. I think it's true to say that if Monty had not been appointed to command the American and British and Canadian armies at D-Day, D-Day would have failed."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But they both get a chance, in this high-energy discussion, to explore the way the Soviet Union ran its propaganda operation in the West and the reasons people fell for it. WFB: "One critic of your [Mr. Koch's] book said that what made your book essentially incredible is that, after all, one need only ask the question: Given how manifest was the terror and the horror in the Soviet Union, obviously nobody would side with it if they had access to the truth. You answer that how?" SK: "... of course the horrors of the regime were leaking out, seeping out in one way or another. At this point the apparatus would come forward and make an argument that would run roughly as follows: The Soviet Union stands for certain crucial things; for one thing it was anti-fascist. It stands against Hitler. You are making a choice, and the choice must be between Hitler and Stalin...." RC: "Well, I think the atmosphere was very much in all those circles--and it's difficult to think of it now--the enormous euphoria about the Soviet Union ... Although, as you say, the facts were around, they were not believed."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But what is cause and what is effect? Is there even such a thing as deterrence? Mr. Bronstein doesn't think so: "We have the most punitive, incarcerative country in the world, ten times as much as most Western European countries, and our crime keeps going up." Mr. Goodman points out a racial discrepancy: "The homicide rate among Caucasians in the United States is lower than it is in England, and on a par with most European countries. What's taking the United States off the map in these international comparisons is the very high crime rate in our minority communities, mainly in inner cities, where the victims as well as the perpetrators are often black." Mr. Hightower seems to agree, although with a twist: "Most auto theft is not about getting a car.

But what is cause and what is effect? Is there even such a thing as deterrence? Mr. Bronstein doesn't think so: "We have the most punitive, incarcerative country in the world, ten times as much as most Western European countries, and our crime keeps going up." Mr. Goodman points out a racial discrepancy: "The homicide rate among Caucasians in the United States is lower than it is in England, and on a par with most European countries. What's taking the United States off the map in these international comparisons is the very high crime rate in our minority communities, mainly in inner cities, where the victims as well as the perpetrators are often black." Mr. Hightower seems to agree, although with a twist: "Most auto theft is not about getting a car. Most auto theft is about carjacking, is about crack cocaine, is about none of the rationality that six white guys sitting around this table here know anything about." So why should we keep trying? Because, as Judge Sanders puts it, "I don't know of anyone in this room here who feels safe."

In 1969, however, in response to pressure from student militants, the college instituted "open enrollment" (see Firing Lines s0277 and s01171). As Mr. Traub puts it, "It was not only a laudable motive in some ways, it was almost unavoidable ... But the fact is, once that was done, nobody could really admit that the consequences were going to be disastrous for City's own standards."

Pro-choicers had swung into action on this target of opportunity, and pro-lifers were, mostly, trying to limit the damage. Mrs. Stover comes perilously close to justifying the killings, but Father Neuhaus firmly brings the discussion back to orthodox moral theology: "What the Paul Hills have done is that they have confirmed precisely the logic of the Roe v. Wade decision, and that is that lethal violence can be a matter of private preference or of private conviction.

But don't go away--it is a half-hour devoted to the implications of the O. J. Simpson trial." In fact, this show is a sort of microcosm of the adversary system, to the audience's benefit. MT: "You and I, as persons of good will, would agree that unreasonable delay is wrong. You and I, as persons of good will, would agree that the truth-seeking process ought to have a primary importance. Where we part company is that you started the program by saying that the Simpson case reflects that the whole thing is rotten to the core and ought to be overthrown--the kind of polemical style that we associate with the young William Buckley of 1950 and not the more mature and conservative William Buckley--" WFB: "Who, by the way, was prophetically correct about everything he said."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A genial session exploring why Americans are so uncomfortable talking about their Maker. DW: "I've had the feeling that people who know now that I've gone back to church, that I've reclaimed my faith and so on, that they're afraid that I'm going to try to convert them ... And I have to suspect that behind that fear is the fear of the 'hound of Heaven'--that people are particularly afraid who know that that's back there, that that's in their own persona somewhere, and they want to push it away." ...

And that means that all words at some point must have been slang, and words like 'mob,' 'bully,' 'sham,' 'jazz,' all were decried as horrible violence against the language....

In this low-key discussion, the Governor explains cogently why, in his view, spending cuts have to follow restructuring (in, say, welfare), and how the Federal Government fits in. WFB: "What is the advantage of the idea of block grants as distinguished from simply assuming the authority to tax and pay for your own welfare system?" GP: "I wouldn't have a problem with bypassing the federal requirement completely." WFB: "Because you'd be a winner." GP: "Because we'd be a winner. Right now I think it's somewhere between 14 and 18 billion dollars more each year New York taxpayers send to Washington than we get back."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Their exchanges on this show are civil, and it is clear that they agree on more things than not; but as to the points of disagreement, neither is going to convince the other. GL: Is the point here that there's a much higher rate of teenage births to black girls, or is the point that American society is plagued with a problem of young, unmarried girls having babies?" DD: "I certainly don't disagree that we're faced with certain problems that are American problems.... And yet, in a sense, the rain doesn't fall evenly in all communities....

Still, Hollywood is a left-wing place. CH: "The other explanation that has occurred to me is that actors and writers make their livings with their imaginations, with their feelings, and thus they put a great deal of faith in them. I may play a part in which I may have to burst into tears at the death of a character that hasn't even been cast yet... It seems to me plausible that therefore actors rely on their emotions for making intellectual decisions, which is not a wise move."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The conversation starts with democracy per se, then moves to the uses of government. MK: "There is a role for society, through its proxy, the government, to slightly rejigger the economic consequences of unalloyed capitalism. I am a great believer in free-market capitalism. It's the most efficient way to produce prosperity, but it does exaggerate or exacerbate the workings of fortune, of luck. And there is nothing wrong with society deciding we are going to even it out a little bit--not a lot, just a little bit."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

So how do we get young black men to marry and work? A splendid half-hour, even if Messrs. Buckley and Koch don't entirely arrive at an answer. EK: "The fact is that we have a system that says if you're married you can't get welfare and therefore it was a stupidity to set the welfare system up that way." WFB: "Now, you were part of the Democratic establishment...Why, in the dozens of years that these laws were accommodated, didn't you struggle against them?" EK: "Well, I must say that I have always been someone who has taken on my own party ... but to expect that I could change the welfare laws in this country is expecting a little too much even from Ed Koch."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The question before the house is: "What's up with Barry?" It is Mr. Edwards's contention that "Senator Goldwater has personalized these issues--influenced by his first wife (a founder of Planned Parenthood) and by a gay grandson. Nonetheless, I call him the most important loser in American politics.... Nobody's going around saying: 'I'm standing on the shoulders of Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern.' And yet Republicans are going around and saying: 'We're standing on the shoulders of Barry Goldwater.' "</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Messrs. Sacks and Thiel had chronicled the result in The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford. Mr. Robinson, meanwhile, had suffered through the Stanford MBA program and found traces of multiculturalism even there. PT: "The kinds of things one reads in the new multicultural curriculum are not things like the Koran or Confucius, but they are things like Lee Iacocca's Car Buyer's Bill of Rights as a comparative study to the United States Bill of Rights; the writing of Chief Seattle contrasted with Plato and Aristotle." ...

Ninety per cent of the instinct of powerful political reporters is, when any issue comes up, the subject doesn't become the issue itself but the handling of the issue: not Chechnya, but Yeltsin's handling of Chechnya, and Clinton's handling of the budget. And handling becomes this great sluice into which all attention goes as opposed to the fundamentals of the question." ...

Simpson trial in midstream (see Firing Line s01053) and now comes back for the aftermath. As Mr. Buckley frames the question, "The intention ... is not to prove that O.J. killed his former wife--in a half-hour, we couldn't prove, against a disputatious guest, that John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln. The intention is to focus on the racial question"--i.e., the fact that some 70 per cent of blacks believe O.J. was innocent, while some 70 per cent of whites believe he was guilty. Think what you will about Mr. Dershowitz's role in the trial, this show offers a brilliant exploration of criminal law from the viewpoint of the criminal lawyer. AD: "Think about what a blunder [letting Simpson try on the glove] was on the part of the prosecution.... They gave the defendant an opportunity to go right up to the jury box, look them straight in the eye, and say: 'It doesn't fit; it's too small, see?' At that point any doubts about whether he had to testify were obviated. He didn't have to testify--he had already testified without a cross-examination.

A session worthy of its subject. WFB: "During the big debate on the Panama Canal Treaty,... Senator Goldwater was in favor of the treaty but he voted against it. Somebody said to him: 'Why did you vote against it?' 'Well,' he said, 'I had 10,000 telegrams on the subject, and 9,900 were against the treaty.' Now is that a form of expiation that satisfies your criteria of integrity?" SLC: "See, the trouble is, it depends on how Burkean you want to be about representation. I deeply believe in the vision of our representative as the trustee, as the person who we elect because we trust his judgment and we want him to bring his moral capacity and intellect to bear on the problems of the day.... The trouble is that the Goldwater comment reflects what most representatives in fact do, which is very much the opposite."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Professor Lefkowitz had aroused a hornet's nest by attacking that myth, but, as she reports in this absorbing conversation--which ranges from Cleopatra's parentage to Plato's philosophy to modern cultural relativism--"the fuss was subsiding and the myth was crumbling." ML: "If we want people to learn about Egypt and ancient Africa, the place to begin is not with Eurocentric mythology.... It's with real Africa and what we can know about that through Egyptian documents and any other information that's out there."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "My point is that all these rich people to whom you constantly make reference are not people who, because they become rich, hurt other people." JKG: "I wouldn't be so sure of that, Bill. It seems to me that as one looks at the modem corporate structure, there is an allocation of income to the upper brackets of the corporation which has been growing enormously in return as compared with that going to the mass of the workers. And I can't but think that that has been to the advantage of the corporate executives and to the disadvantage of those whose income is stable or declining." WFB: "There weren't any workers till Bill Gates quit school, went into his garage, and invented Microsoft. Now there are 40,000 of them. I think that's good, and if he ends up with $13 billion, I couldn't care less."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

This genial and substantive discussion ranges from the difficulties of being a Democrat to the unconscionability of the Boston busing decision of 1974, which "was unjust because it only came in upon the children of the poor, and it was unnecessary because it came in upon the people who were living the most integrated lives, the people who lived within the borders of the city of Boston." ... WFB: "You have a hard affiliation with a political party that has given you the most trouble in respect of a concrete situation." WMB: "That's true.

This is a fascinating story, beginning with the first meeting of the President and the Pope in June of 1981, while each was recovering from the assassination attempt on him. As Mr. Bernstein recounts here, "Reagan said to the Pope: 'Look how God has saved us for a special task in the East.' And the Pope agreed." CB: "This Pope, with all his spirituality, with his mysticism and the fact that he wanted to be a barefoot Carmelite monk, nonetheless thinks also in the language of geopolitics. And this is the source of his greatness--the ability to do both."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

It is a development that Mr. Califano deplores: "I think [the voters] were sold a bill of goods. I think they were bamboozled." He argues persuasively that the referenda were written much more broadly than proponents portrayed them. WFB argues persuasively against the slippery-slope argument: "Let that person dying of cancer have one whiff of marijuana and everybody's going to die of a morphine fix." You pays your money and you takes your choice--but the two men lay out the choice with crystal clarity.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Our guests are almost too far apart to engage each other's arguments. For Father Fitzpatrick (whose doctoral dissertation was on personal autonomy and the right to commit suicide), it matters deeply that, "if physician-assisted suicide were legalized, for the first time in American society, and probably in the West, we will now have private killing authorized by public law." For Dr. Brock, "I think simply that that Christian tradition, powerful though it is, shouldn't be imposed on all of society, because a significant portion of society doesn't accept at least that part of the Christian tradition."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In some aspects it is related to, indeed constitutes one strain of, conservatism; in others it approaches anarchism. One sample from this lively conversation: WFB: "I founded a journal, National Review, which I think of as a libertarian journal. Now, a very orthodox challenge was leveled at us by somebody ... who said that we weren't libertarian because we favored pursuing the Cold War.... Now, would that have been a disqualifying characteristic in your judgment...?" CM: "My own opinion is that national defense is one of the legitimate functions of government... And when you have an enemy of the kind we had in the Soviet Union, I think it calls for extraordinary measures...." DB: "Although a strong national defense is essential, I think during the Cold War we sometimes engaged in a national offense [e.g., in Vietnam]."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mrs. O'Beirne had been the first to ask publicly whether he shouldn't step down as Speaker of the House. On this show, she and her colleagues give us gloom and doom in the most entertaining way. JO: "Although the Republicans won in '94 and survived to win again in '96, they still have an opposition mentality.... If you're a successful Republican in the House of Representatives, you may get respect there, but the moment you go, say, on the Today show ... you're treated as if you're some kind of weird creature from the black lagoon."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

One of them, Aaron Pierce, explains the current low level of political activity on the nation's campuses: "Politics is not necessarily seen as something that's going to benefit one as a student; whether you get an A in your calculus class is. So there just isn't the incentive to go out and learn about some of those issues." If he and his colleagues were paying attention, they received from their host a capsule definition of a bedrock principle of political ethics: "I, and most conservatives, believe in the so-called doctrine of subsidiarity. It says anything that can be accomplished in the private sector should be undertaken by the private sector. If you go to the public sector, it should always begin with the lowest feasible political unit, rising to the highest--in this case, the Federal Government--only when the subsidiary units can't."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Tanenhaus's new book, WFB tells us, "leaves the reader better informed about America, but also engrossed by high human drama." Much of this comes through in this absorbing half-hour. ST: "Here's a man who many people think lied about everything he ever said. So that forced me as his biographer to check the most minute details.

Dr. Chang-Diaz--confirming the statement of an earlier Firing Line guest, astronaut Edgar Mitchell (Firing Line s0279)--also tells us how our space program looks from his native Costa Rica: "I know a lot of other young people all over Latin America that look at NASA as the epitome, the highest thing that humans can do.

Two of the female cadets had since left the school and, again with great fanfare, filed suit against the school for the hazing they had suffered.

A splendid debate on a complex question.

Tales of rich people paying $200 a month for seven-room apartments on Central Park West set ordinary New Yorkers' teeth on edge; Mr. Koch famously, while Mayor, refused to give up his rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village. Host and guests take us, as lucidly as the subject permits, through issues such as when "luxury decontrol" kicks in (removing controls when a person's income and rent reach a certain level), who may inherit a rent-controlled apartment, and what protections ought to be given the poor--although they don't spell out, for the benefit of non-New Yorkers, points such as the difference between "rent control" and "rent stabilization," and the fact that it is the State legislature, not the City Council, that has authority to change the law. One sample from this spirited exchange: EK: "The poor people, overwhelmingly, are not really concerned [about the possibility of decontrol], because in the areas where poor people live, the rent's not going to go up appreciably, if at all. But on the Upper West Side,... I believe it will go up 100 per cent. And that would remove the middle class from this town, and that would be bad...." RS: "I've been hearing for the last forty years that if we don't do this or don't do that, we're going to lose the middle class. I state the middle class is still here."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Furthermore, it had been just a little over a year since Peking had lobbed a few missiles in the direction of Taiwan. Mr. Lien is too prudent to be as informative as he might be (WFB: "Well, I agree with you, but my question is, In the event that Beijing does not live up to these promises, is there any formal way in which you can protest that development? Do you have any sanctions in mind?" LC: "We have not considered that aspect of development yet. But if they do violate their pledge, I think it will have very important chilling implications over the peace and security issues in this area"), but he is an impressive figure, and he does bring us up to date on the Republic of China's solution to the problem posed by the "One China" policy: "We believe that China certainly should be one, but unfortunately it is a divided nation. It is now divided into two political entities. Therefore, as a political sovereign state, the Republic of China on Taiwan is entitled to enjoy a comprehensive system of rights ... befitting any sovereign state in the world."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

For starters, "family reunification" does not mean just husbands and wives, or parents and minor children: RB: "Most of the people who came in under family reunification last year were the second cousins and third cousins and nieces and nephews and in-laws of people who came in maybe twenty years ago.

The points at issue, which emerge from today's discussion: "Should we bring in the fledgling democracies of the East, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia?" Were we wrong to establish the new Russia-NATO Council (the price exacted for NATO expansion), which could have the effect of weakening NATO as a military alliance?

Specifically, with the cases of Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, whom the Air Force had discharged on the grounds of adultery, and General Joseph Ralston, whom it elected not to punish. To Rep. Maloney--as to much of the establishment press--"You can't have one rule for a woman and a different one for a man." To Mr. Buckley, there were far more signal differences than the sex of the officer: Lieutenant Flinn's affairs were with a pilot under her command, and with the husband of a pilot under her command, a clear violation of military discipline; General Ralston's affair was with a civilian. Mr. Rich mostly stays out of the fray, but when he speaks it is to the point: "The whole way Ralston was pilloried through this hotline ... is almost emblematic of how this whole thing has gone astray.... If it hit Ralston this time, it may hit a woman the next time. It seems chaotic to me."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Weld meanwhile--who the year before had failed in his challenge to incumbent Democratic Senator John Kerry--had resigned from the governorship to concentrate on the confirmation hearings. To help sort all this out, we have the retired Democratic boss of the Massachusetts legislature, who in this genial session says of his former enemy turned friend, "I think he is just off on a little bit of a--having fun. He may become the ambassador to Mexico. If he really were intent on being the ambassador, however, I think he'd have sought it from the governor's office in Massachusetts." Mr. Buckley suggests another thing Mr. Weld could have done differently: "My own notion is that Mr. Weld became sort of provocative. He said, along the line: 'Look, I'm drawing a line and you troglodytes over there are different from us types who are sort of airborne Republicans who understand all these niceties.'" And Mr. Bulger adds a salutary warning about our media guardians: "In Massachusetts Helms is only a caricature. We have no idea what he's like. It filters through an exceedingly liberal media up there."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A sometimes abstruse but often moving analysis of what happened and why it still matters. WFB: "Presumably somebody who hasn't checked in on his bank account for fifty years doesn't know it exists, right? Or the children don't know it exists?..." EB: "Well, they did. A lot checked in 1946 and were told that they had to provide death certificates. And you know, to find a death certificate of someone who was gassed is a big trick." ... HJ: "It seems to me not to be a question of indicting a whole society, but to be looking at the way in which ... particular people made decisions--for instance,... the shocking case about the pressure to put the J [for Jude] on German passports, or the decision in August 1942 not to count people who were persecuted for racial reasons as political persecutees. All those have particular people who were responsible for them."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

According to some observers they got that chance in the just-passed budget bill. A major provision of the reform act had been workfare--along lines pioneered by Governor Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin--which Mr. Solarz accurately describes as "a useful vehicle for encouraging people to acquire the skills that enable them to go into the private sector." The budget bill contained a provision mandating the minimum wage for workfare, which, Mr. Rector argues, would put it on an entirely different basis. SS: "My sense is that there is a sufficient national consensus in favor of welfare reform in general and workfare in particular, so that if ... these dire prognostications turn out to be accurate, the Congress will undoubtedly enact legislation making possible a restoration of the workfare program." RR: "They did. They just did. And Clinton promised to veto it."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The questions he raises are far from new, but it is helpful to hear them articulated by a sympathetic self-described "outsider." MW: "God apparently created the human race knowing that he would damn most of them-because 'strait is the gate,' 'few are chosen'-to eternity. And most people are surely not saints. They cheat on their taxes, they cheat on their spouse, and so on. So they deserve punishment. Would a hundred years in hell suffice? How about a thousand..? But eternity..? There seems to be such a vast disproportion between the crime and the punishment." WFB: "Well, I think I can bring you instant relief on this point, because as far as I know it's only the Calvinists who insist that the overwhelming number of people are doomed to damnation..." MW: "Christianity is above all else a religion of paradoxes. The idea of God dying, and dying by the most humiliating of all punishments...that is such a monumental paradox. It needs dwelling on for the spiritual resonance that it has because it is incomprehensible."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

I think that secular opinion elites are afraid of ... orthodox faith in all its forms") and its opportunities now that it has passed through "an almost unwritten rite of initiation." But in discussing the future Mr. Reed takes us thoughtfully back into our country's history: "John Adams said that our Constitution was designed for a moral and religious people only and is wholly unsuited for any other. By that he obviously didn't mean that you had to be a member of a particular church to be an American. What he was saying was that in order to have a government limited to certain enumerated purposes ... the only way you could live in such a society without a strong centralized government and have peace and tranquillity was if everybody voluntarily did what was right anyway."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

As Mr. Buckley explains it, "The regular route permits no-fault divorce more or less overnight. The covenant marriage would bind the marriage partners to a five-year moratorium before divorce is effective, and commit the partners to receiving marriage counseling, both before the marriage and after, if dissolution is sought." To Dr. Ragsdale, "I think we should teach people about the difficulty of maintaining true covenanted relationships; we should teach people to expect trouble in their marriages and to work through it.... I don't think that binding someone ever more tightly by the law is the way to accomplish it." To Ms. Gallagher, "Let me tell you what a waiting period can accomplish. First of all the evidence we have suggests that you will save some marriages that could and should be saved. That's the first goal. The second goal is that you shift at least some power and respect into the hand of the spouse that's being left. Right now, we talk about divorce as something that couples do, but in about 80 per cent of cases, it's something that one spouse wants and the other spouse doesn't."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

To Ms. Morgan, "We do have a rich culture here, and that makes Southern universities distinct, but what also makes us unique is that they offer the rich culture without sacrificing the academic rigor, and you can't get that anywhere else in the country. It's either one or the other. And we have it all here." To Mr. Thigpen, "I think what makes Southern universities distinctive, maybe,... is the education you get outside of the classroom....

I don't think that I, as a private citizen, if I haven't broken any law, am prohibited from having a private conversation with another private citizen without any intervention, court-ordered or not."

Miss Strossen vigorously opposes the latter ("That's very frightening in a free society, Bill. Where do you draw the line between aggressive, investigative reporting? Don't we consider that to be a heroic, essential undertaking in a democracy?") while asserting that "The ACLU proudly defends privacy ... in particular where it is most endangered, and that is, as you alluded to in your opening remarks, not for celebrities, but for the ordinary citizen ...

Objections had been raised from many points on the political spectrum, and on many grounds (principally interference with local control, and the inherent inadequacy of standardized tests). A high-octane session with two deeply knowledgeable guests. NL: "When ETS [the Educational Testing Service] was founded, the man who was the first president kept a diary.... And one of the things he wrote in his diary right as it was starting was: 'These tests will be for the 20th century what the standard gauge was for railroads in the 19th century.' It's a way of creating--" WFB: "Procrusteanization." NL: "It creates a national market in personnel.... And the other [thing the tests do] ... is being a diagnostic tool to be used to improve education. On the first measure they have worked out fabulously well. On the second measure they haven't worked that well." ... BS: "We already have widely used achievement tests across this country--the Stanfords, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the California Achievement Test--which have identified how schools are performing. The task before this nation is not to measure it again, particularly not to measure it with low-level tools, which do dumb down education for everybody, because the schools focus on what they measure, and what you test for is what you get."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The first 5 volumes had by now been published--to a concentrated lack of enthusiasm from the establishment. In this absorbing exchange, Mr. Buckley and his guest explore the possible reasons for this (among them that the establishment didn't want to know that the Communist Party in the United States had been engaged in espionage for the Soviet Union), but some of the most fascinating bits are Mr. Brent's simple description of the difficulties of negotiating the deal ("The Russians ... had no idea what the list price of a book was. They had no idea what a royalty was") or of the physical state of the Soviet archives ("You don't understand. The Russian archives are completely falling apart. They don't have Xerox machines. In the archive of the Red Army, for the chief archivist to turn on the light in her office, she opens the drawer of her desk, she takes out a light bulb, she stands on a chair and screws it in.

He is not a sparkling speaker, but the information he has to impart has enough intrinsic interest to be well worth listening to. Two samples: "In the international realm, [the Shah] was very shrewd, both in terms of oil politics, as you are talking about, but also in terms of understanding America and understanding Americans. He surrounded himself with individuals that ... could talk baseball with our ambassadors, could talk sailing. He was very, very shrewd. Unfortunately, however, he was not as shrewd with his own people." ... "The sad story of Iraq really began in the early 1980s, whereby the United States began to throw substantial support in the direction of Saddam. In 1972 we took him and his country off our terrorist list. In 1983 we began to share sensitive intelligence information with him. He was involved, of course, in the war with Iran at that time." WFB: "That was a mistake?" JB: "I think it proved to be a great mistake, because we created a Frankenstein. We created our own Frankenstein, who turned on us."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This is not the fastest-moving Firing Line, but our guests both have fresh ways of helping us grasp the difference between tolerance and plain sloppiness of thought. PAH: "I remind [my students] that moral relativism is going to play itself out one day. If the statistics about violence are current, it will probably happen in a very dark parking lot... You're going to your car believing that your car is your property and only your property. Well, lurking in the shadows near your car is someone who also has a moral vision, and you've already decided that you are not going to judge it as he cannot judge yours, and yet his moral vision includes the idea that everyone's car is potentially his property."... MPA: "I think the problem, so often, is when we think of this term 'morality' or 'ethics' we think of it as a private matter rather than as a matter of public significance, when indeed the question about morality is about how do we live among others."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This show is no sparring match; instead, Mr. Buckley invites Mr. Glynn to lead us through these thickets, which he does with great enthusiasm and clarity: "And scientists ... began to look at the evolution of the universe ... And what they began to do was play with the various values in the universe ... like, you change the value of gravity, or you change the value of electromagnetism, or you change the masses of the subatomic particles. And what they found in these various thought experiments or exercises is that every time they made even a slight change, the whole Big Bang derailed.... And so it began to dawn on scientists that biological life, far from being sort of an accident that just happened ... had to have been programmed into the universe from the very, very start."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

"And so," Mr. Buckley begins, "we resume, as alas we may need to do for years ahead, our periodic, worried look at the scene in Israel." Mr. Zion, as we have seen on past Firing Lines, is a passionate defender of Israel no matter what; Mr. Rosenblum believes the Netanyahu government will not keep its part of the bargain without a great deal of pressure. WFB: "Are you saying that in order to appease Saudi Arabia et al. we've got to stay in this act?" MR: "It's not appeasement of Saudi Arabia. There are fundamentalists--politically violent fundamentalist movements--that are alive and well in the region." WFB: "But to appease is not necessarily bad." MR: "No, no, but it's a word like 'pressure' that generally does not resonate in a positive way. So the search for alternative words is important here." SZ: "Well, sure. The word you are doing here is blackmail."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Suggested solutions tend towards things like vouchers and charter schools--in order to improve quality by competition--or towards national testing and computers in the classroom. Comes now Leon Botstein (a regular on Firing Line Debates) with a radical proposal: abolish high schools. In this high-energy session--which ranges over the problem of teachers' colleges ("Our teacher training system is the most corrupt, old-fashioned, and useless of any civilized nation") and our "segmented" education system, in which the college professor is seen as doing something radically different from the elementary-school teacher--Mr. Botstein supports his idea brilliantly: "We lose precious time in developing [adolescents'] real passion for learning by a system of education, the high school, which was designed for very big children but is now used with young adults.... In the 19th century people went from home schooling directly to college at 15. This is not a terribly new idea, but there is here now a serious biological basis for it, since probably the age of menstruation has dropped since the mid 19th century to the late 20th century by over three years."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Our guests don't buy it. WGH: "1950 was when world population finally reached 2.5 billion people. In the fifty years--well, less than fifty years--since then ... world population has grown by almost 3.5 billion. Now that means all of human history and prehistory to 2.5, and then less than fifty years to add 3.5. Now as to the future ... if the median projection proves correct ... in about fifty years or so world population will again add almost 3.5 billion people." Mr. Buckley asks, "Has either of you calculated to what extent is the huge population increase that you've just mentioned owing to longevity?" VA: "Oh, that's a factor, but it's not as large a factor at the older ages as it is because of reduction of infant mortality...." WGH: "But the driving force is fertility." And we're off on an absorbing discussion of the psychology and ethics of Third World population-control programs.</p><p> Availability: Not available.

A leading opponent of this decision is Mr. Abram, who first appeared on the public scene as a young prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, and who brings that perspective to bear in this thoughtful conversation, full of chiaroscuro. MBA: "My question to you is: What is a world to do which knows that about eight thousand people were assembled ... in a safe haven around Srebrenica and were executed? Now we know that, and we know who gave the orders, and they have been indicted.... It's the same question that was put to the Allied powers after World War II. What are you going to do if you catch Hitler, Kaltenbrunner, Himmler, and Ribbentrop and Goering? Churchill said, 'Let's shoot them.' Now that didn't go over with many people." WFB: "He wanted summary justice." MBA: "Yes, sir. Right in the field. Others said, 'Well, we let the Kaiser get away with it, maybe we should let him get away with it.' The decision of the Allied powers, then called United Nations, was to hold trials under the rubric of law and the rule of law."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This rich discussion situates Pope John Paul II both in the current context and in the light of history. RM: "The powers which the pope had through fully one-half of the history of the Church--that is, the first millennium--were considerably more modest than the powers which the pope accrued ... beginning especially with the papacy of Gregory VII, the end of the 11th century. And I think John Paul II has-- It's almost a climactic moment, his pontificate. He hasn't usurped any power; he is exercising the canonical authority that accrued to the papacy in the second millennium, and he's exercised it more adeptly than any pope before him ... So one should stand back and admire him for using the powers that the canon law of the Church has given him since Gregory VII. But we don't want to say that those are powers which Jesus gave Peter."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Why? Actually, Mr. Heston concedes, the amendments "are all of equal importance. [But] the Second Amendment is the only one equipped to protect and defend the others." A vivid conversation between these two old friends that ranges from the use of guns in resisting tyranny, to the woman needing protection when she comes home late at night from her cleaning job, to this, from Mr. Heston's experience directing a play in China: "Several of my actors were in Tiananmen Square, and ... one of the survivors said, 'You know, as a student of your Constitution and your Bill of Rights, of course freedom of speech is crucial. Freedom of speech doesn't help you much if you're standing in front of a tank.'" WFB: "No. That's eloquently correct. As a matter of fact, not even a pistol would help you very much."CH: "No, not even a pistol. Indeed. A grenade launcher might do the trick."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

On this show a Kennedy loyalist and a former Kennedy loyalist offer a deeply engaging exploration of whether, as their host phrases it, "we are talking about a weakness of character that affected Kennedy's competence or judgment as President of the United States." AS: "The Seymour Hersh book is a really ridiculous book. He is the most gullible investigative reporter, perhaps, in American history. He will believe anything so long as it discredits John Kennedy...." TCR: "I don't want to defend a bad book at great length, but [Seymour Hersh] said he interviewed more than a thousand people. I counted at least 25 of those interviews that are terrific. See, what the audience has to understand is that there has been a concerted effort by the Kennedy family, with the assistance of at least two prominent members of the former Administration, to keep historians from finding out who the Kennedys really were."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Our guests bring fresh perspectives to this often-discussed topic. LZ: "In the effort to discourage recreational use, and in particular to discourage kids from using marijuana, the government and other groups have gone too far and they have described harms of marijuana that in fact are not true ... And I think that's been one of the problems in trying to get the government to take another look at the medical-marijuana issue, that they have gone so far in demonizing marijuana that it's very difficult for them now to pull back..." EN: "More people voted for Proposition 215 in California than voted for either of the presidential candidates. Half of them believe in legalizing marijuana more broadly, the other half don't. But they all agreed that for medical purposes it was a necessity."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

The previous year some forty state attorneys general had made a pact with the tobacco companies with the aim of reducing tobacco use generally, but particularly among minors, and Senator McCain was pushing for the Federal Government to get more involved. A genial, sometimes enlightening traversal of familiar ground. WFB: "The stimulation of an ethos is a very, very difficult thing to do. Now in my judgment it has substantially succeeded in the matter of tobacco. You go to a reception, a social reception, and practically nobody is smoking--anybody who does smoke is very conspicuous--contrasted with forty years ago, half the people would be smoking...." JM: "But let me point out that you and I go to a reception and nobody's smoking. But if you and I went down to the mall, we'd see a whole lot of teenagers smoking.

One sample from Senator Gramm: "Why are we not moving quicker? I think it's a combination of two things: Number one, politics is principally a ... short-term transaction, and I think that the ability to put this off potentially for another five or six years is appealing to some people. I think, secondly--I'm a conservative and I often get criticized for being doctrinaire. But our biggest problem here is with liberals who are committed to the principle of a government-run, debt-based system. They like the politics of it, they like the social engineering of it, and even though it will fail and even though it will cause taxes to skyrocket and benefits to be slashed, they hate to give it up."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB begins by asking. "The broadest view on the subject tells us that societies that are fat and happy tend to let down the moral muscle.... The position is vigorously disputed ... by Lawrence Kudlow," whose latest book was American Abundance: The New Economic and Moral Prosperity. Mr. Buckley presses his guest, a comrade in arms, on some of his historical comparisons. LK: "We have created 36 million jobs since 1982 in this long wave of prosperity that I attribute to Ronald Reagan's launching.... And I think that's why this work ethic and what it teaches, the discipline and restraint, has helped to reduce crime, to reduce welfare, to at least ameliorate some of the pathologies that are so troublesome. It all comes from the workplace." WFB: "The difficulty that I had when I ran into that enthusiasm in your book is that if you look back at American history--where you learn that in the year 1900, 90 per cent of the American people were poor by current standards--if you take that long march towards relative plenty since 1900, you run into pretty odious data: an increase since 1962 of 400 per cent in the crime rate, 320 per cent in illegitimate births, drug consumption, alcoholism ..."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

An energetic discussion of the history and theory of free trade, and why we need to do better than 2 1/2 per cent growth. JJJ: "Manufacturers in particular are very pragmatic people. They have to make things and then they have to compete. They have to sell at a profit in competitive markets. And the Japanese threat, which now is almost a joke, scared manufacturers beyond their wits, and they decided that they had to change how they operated, and one of the things they had to do was benchmark on a global basis, and they had to compete on a global basis."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But he goes on, "The Disuniting of America began as a long essay and blossomed into a short book, greatly needed and much celebrated, though not by everybody." The book argued that present-day multiculturalism engendered not a tolerance of cultural differences within a whole, but rather a divisive "identity politics." This rich conversation explores how we differ from the English founders of our country, how our attitudes on race have evolved (AS: "[America is] the country that killed red men, enslaved black men, imported yellow and brown men for peon labor. We did it thoughtlessly, without consciousness of what we were doing. The only good Indian is a dead Indian, and so on. Now we've become much more conscious of the fact that, as Paul says, we are all members one of another..."), and how this affects our politics today. WFB: "It seems to me that you worship rather too strenuously at the altar of civil liberties so defined. I don't acknowledge the right of Nazis to march." AS: "I am surprised, Bill, that you deplore liberty." WFB: "In order to maximize liberty, one sometimes has to."

Consensus is not and could not be reached, but we get a clear idea of the opposing positions on Prime Minister Netanyahu's rejection of certain Clinton Administration proposals. HS: "Netanyahu is incapable of making decisions, and whatever his long-range strategic vision may be, assuming he has one, it is something that he treats in eschatological terms. In terms of the immediate realities, his goal is to delay decisions and keep delaying them, and allow the status quo to prevail." ... SZ: "Bibi Netanyahu got elected not because he was against the peace process, but because he was going to insist that it was a bilateral agreement and that they had to do what they promised.... If he had been against the peace he would never have been elected."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Those shows were fun but hectic, with seven or eight people clamoring for attention. This new format allows for real discussion, and this one proves enlightening, even if none of the participants' minds was changed. LG: "Nearly every change in the domestic social policy in the last forty years has, amazingly, come not from legislatures but from the Supreme Court. We have basic questions of criminal procedure, prayer in the schools, and so on that have been decided by the Supreme Court. Now how has that happened? Well, they're interpreting the Constitution. . . . And virtually all of these decisions . . . involve or purport to involve a single constitutional provision, the Fourteenth Amendment." . . . NS: "Barry Lynn mentioned our victory in having the Supreme Court. . . strike down Congress's attempt to regulate the Internet, but at the very same time, not only states but local library boards and local school boards were busy enacting their own restrictions on the Internet. Now that is a particularly dramatic example, because given the global nature of this medium, what's done in one local district, one state, can affect censorship and free speech not only for everybody in that local community, but indeed in the entire United States and even worldwide."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

And is the government--are we going to start to legislate by law what we deem to be proper sexual behavior?"...

The reason for the surprise is that Judge Bork is associated with the school that asks for minimum federal activity in the antitrust theater." His Honor leads us pellucidly through both the legal and the technological reasons for his stance: "Most of the people they [Microsoft] deal with are not allowed to mention Netscape to a customer.... They have a whole list of such agreements which do not create efficiency that's beneficial to consumers but only stifle competition." ... "The Department of Justice has indicted or sued people for being successful. And the Supreme Court, in the days of the Warren Court, upheld those cases against successful people. I think no defendant ever won a case in the Warren Court. But the Department of Justice is not that way now, and I know the current assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. He is very bright and very cautious and believes in the free market. He is not out there punishing somebody just because he doesn't like success."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "I think what you've bumped into is the problem of seeming to object to the aesthetic dimension of human relations. I never want my wife to stop using lipstick. My mother, who died at 89, used lipstick till the last day, and it would have horrified me as a form of spiritual capitulation if she'd stopped doing so.... Now I don't see why a reasonable analogy of that wouldn't be popping a pill if you're going bald, simply on the grounds that it's not much trouble to pop a pill, but people kind of look nice with hair on." ... SN: "We now have a great deal of evidence indicating that more than 50 per cent of the time, the living will is ignored in intensive-care units in teaching hospitals ... Young doctors are spitfire pilots.

Since this coincided with a drastic decline in the City's elementary and secondary public schools, the result was a number of freshmen who, as WFB puts it, "couldn't read or write well enough to profit from higher education" (see Firing Lines s0277 and s01039). Comes now Herman Badillo--a veteran New York politico, born in Puerto Rico but educated in New York City (before the decline)--with a resolution to end open admissions. His main opponent is Mr. Sullivan, Chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Higher Education, and they have at it here, civilly but passionately. ECS: "One of the things Mr. Badillo has done ... is to try to denigrate a degree from City University. Did you know that John Jay College, which specializes in criminal justice, was voted by the peers around the country as the finest college in criminal justice in the United States? Harvard was second...." HB: "But let me give you another figure which is very depressing. ... At City College, which was the flagship institution, over 60 per cent of the students who get a bachelor's degree or a master's degree in education to be teachers, they get a degree and they cannot pass the teacher's exam."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Senator Goldwater had died on May 29, at the age of 89, in his beloved Phoenix. Before showing clips from the two shows taped at his home there in 1993, Mr. Buckley recalls his old friend and comrade in arms: "He was a considerable figure in America. A presidential candidate, of course, but a figure who, by espousing so forcefully conservative ideas, gave political America the sense that we hadn't been entirely drowned by the New Deal. And, of course, Goldwater was unremitting in his opposition to Communism, whose defeat he lived to see. ...

JJJ: "If you look at the situation 15 years ago, the American industrial system was supposed to be buried by the Japanese, and now the tables are completely reversed, and it all has to do with innovation and change in America. That's why we were able to come back.... I think that Japanese culture has great difficulty making big changes, and that's why I continue to be a little pessimistic that even as you look forward into '99, we may not get a Japanese economy that's strong enough...." PB: "What I would like to see in Japan is them being able to sit down politically and come to grips with the necessity of dealing with bankruptcies, dealing with the real-estate bubble, having to write off difficult loans ...

An absorbing session with a man who, whether or not conservatives will always agree with him, gives a vivid account of how the world let this mess get as bad as it is, and what we might still do to retrieve the situation. RH: "Negotiating things like this really makes you pleased about America. We were in Dayton, and Dayton is in Ohio, and Ohio has more of the people from this area [the Balkans] than any other state in the Union. We were picketed by Albanian-Americans; Croats and Serbs came to us; the governor of Ohio was Serbian-American; John Kasich is Croat-American, the powerful Republican congressman; the publisher of the Cleveland Plain Dealer is Serbian-American. I kept saying to all the people at Dayton, 'Look, in Ohio they restrict their rivalry to softball games and an occasional barroom fight. Why can't you do the same thing in your own area?'

As a young man he had criticized Communism during the short-lived Hundred Flowers Campaign, for which offense he was sent to Laogai (the Chinese equivalent of Gulag); as the winds of change blew through China in 1979, following Mao's death, he was released and was allowed to emigrate to the United States. In 1995 he was arrested trying to re-enter China in order to document his assertions about Laogai. This time he was expelled from the country instead of being sent back to the camps where he had spent 19 years. His English is somewhat halting, but his mere presence is a tremendous witness to the human spirit, and he gives trenchant advice about how the United States can help the cause of freedom: "China today is on a crossroads of the history. This is very good opportunity for Chinese and American and the people of the world. Give a little bit of push and the Communist regime will disappear from China. ... You mentioned a student personal exchange. Very good program. Radio Free Asia: very good program. But you know, Chinese did not accept the reporters from Radio Free Asia, denied their visas. If America says, 'If you deny their visas I will deny your visa and I will cancel some of the economic contracts,' that is some real thing in the constructive-engagement policy."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This session comes back home and looks at the American worker--and, in terms of training, our guests don't like what they see. But they are not prepared to give up, and this show is ultimately quite encouraging. PB: "Now, before individuals can get in the available pool to join the [Sonoco] plant, we're asking them to go over to the local community college to be trained there and tested and evaluated to see if they've got the requisite skills; also to help them get those skills." ... JJJ: "We have to ... move people up to a whole higher level of skills. It's not just basic mathematics and basic reading. It's also computer skills. It's a new critical facility.

As a talk-show guest, the Major suffers from a desire to impart all he knows about the subject in half an hour; but what we do learn should send us to his book to learn more. HRM: "One of the elements of the conventional wisdom in connection with Vietnam is that Vietnam was a quagmire that sucked an unwitting American Government into a war that it fundamentally did not understand. What this new evidence suggests--most of it recently declassified documents of the most confidential meetings between the President and his closest advisors, and tapes of telephone conversations, for example, between Lyndon Johnson and his closest advisors and confidants--[is] that these were men who not only should have known better, but who did know better and who made these decisions anyway."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

There is some serious discussion of what James Madison and his colleagues meant by "high crimes and misdemeanors" and what impeachment of a President would mean to the nation; but there is also a great deal of unbridled contempt for William Jefferson Clinton. AC: "We already know he's a pervert, he's a creep, he's a liar, he obstructs justice. He appears to actually be a criminal. And it is going to bring him down in our esteem that Congress finally gets around to saying, 'Oh, and we censure you'? ...

Mrs. Thatcher's successor, John Major, sent Christopher Patten to Hong Kong to implement the transition, and, as Mr. Buckley puts it, "Acting with strict accordance to the letter of the law on the final agreement between London and Beijing, he jump-started self-rule." We get a taste here of how he managed it, as he speaks trenchantly and engagingly of freedom and totalitarianism east of Suez. CP: "I did have the license to say to my colleagues in London and to people in Hong Kong, 'Look, when we talk about things like the rule of law, when we talk about civil liberties, when we talk about elections, we mean the real thing, not how China may redefine these things.' In relation to elections, for example, I am often embarrassed by the modesty of what I tried to do and say, which provoked this astonishing reaction from China....

Both teams had seen their leaders wounded--Newt Gingrich by the 1995 "government shutdown" (a political disaster, though nothing much happened to the government itself) and then by allegations of personal financial misdoings; Bill Clinton by Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones and all the rest. Each team had a trend in its favor--for the Democrats, the fact that the Republicans had already, in 1996, fallen back from their stunning victory in 1994; for the Republicans, the fact that the party in control of the White House normally suffers in the off-year election. Mr. Fund is a conservative Republican, Mr. Green a liberal Democrat, and Mr. Buckley starts by requesting "that they attempt to give opinions as objective as they can manage, even if to do so gives aid and comfort to the enemy." Mr. Green starts by conceding that "When Bill Clinton first got elected, the Democrats had a majority in the Senate, the House, the governors' mansions, and the Democrats have lost all three," and we're off on a pungent exchange ranging from the tobacco companies to school vouchers to what Mr. Fund describes as "the memo written by Hillary Rodham, who I think laid out the constitutional basis for impeachment."

JL: "Well, I think the lies are the central part of it.... The suborning of perjury, the perjury, the inducing of Madeleine Albright... to lie, getting his lawyers to lie. I think this is a huge bit of wreckage that the President has presented us with, and to peel it all back and say, 'Would we feel the same way about a consensual adulterous affair?' I think, is too hypothetical." ... JP: "What we have here ... is a story not just of immoral sexual conduct, but a rather grotesque betrayal play in which every character in this drama, theoretically, is betraying someone else. Clinton is betraying his wife; he is betraying his mistress, Ms. Lewinsky, by essentially throwing her to the dogs, encouraging her ... to lie in the Paula Jones deposition, thus placing her at great risk of jail. She herself is then betrayed by her friend Linda Tripp, who is taping her ..."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Was there still a point to it? Mr. Schlesinger calmly and convincingly tells us why there is, and how some people got the idea that there wasn't. JRS: "Everything that the agency has done over the years has been authorized by the political authorities. A lot of people don't like what the political authorities have authorized, [but]... they criticized the agent rather than those who did it. When the Kennedy brothers were interested in disposing of Mr. Castro, for example, when these issues surfaced, they surfaced less as a criticism of President Kennedy or his brother the Attorney General than it was a criticism of the agency--for doing what the President of the United States through the National Security Council had authorized." WFB: "So, in other words, the idea that a headstrong agency simply went to Chile or Guatemala and said, 'It would be fun to throw the government over'--that's just anti-CIA cant? ..." JRS: "It's not necessarily anti-CIA cant, it's simply ignorance."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

But even if they sometimes forget that they are speaking to a lay audience, we get a good sense of how the Catholic Church promulgates--and argues about--its doctrines. Father McBrien: "In my course--and I teach over a hundred students every year-I never once would get up and say the Pope is wrong about birth control." Mr. Mclnerny: "Are you saying it now?" Father McBrien: "No, I'm just-I disagree with the teaching on birth control." Mr. Mclnerny: "Why? Because he's wrong..?" Father McBrien: "We shouldn't let the leaders off scot-free-not just popes, but also bishops... How effectively are they teaching? Why is there such a wide disconnect from so many people..?" Mr. Mclnerny: "I find the present Pope to be a magnificent teacher, and it seems to me when he does speak, people understand him very easily and follow him... When he came on his first visit [to America] it was a magnificent occasion... Immediately after he left there were people who were undercutting what he said and saying, 'Well, he doesn't understand the United States...' So the impact of the man, it seems to me, is sapped right at the roots."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

But they had been expecting great gains from the Clinton scandals. In helping us sort it all out, our guests are entertainingly gloomy. WFB: "How possible is it in an age of television and radio for an individual running for state office or federal office to make his own points clear to his constituency? ..." ER: "Oh, I think it's very possible.... And I have had plenty of experience. People would listen to a candidate for state comptroller or a candidate for Buffalo councilman more than they would listen to a congressman or a senator. People believe in their state and local government."... JF: "During the 1974 Nixon debacle there were a hundred polls on the subject. There were five hundred this year.... A politician is scared of his own shadow unless he has a poll and a focus group in both hands."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Is there a need, let alone a philosophical justification, for such a thing, or was Mr. Clinton's call nothing more than what George Will designated as moral pork barrel?" A crackling exchange over the conflicting legal principles. WFB: "John hits this passerby, who's black, and steals his wallet. Now, if he is convicted merely of stealing, he gets five years, let's say. But if he is convicted of hitting him because he's black, he gets ten years. Now why would that one sentiment, i.e., prejudice, be more greatly penalized than the kind of cupidity that brings on mugging and stealing?" NS: "Well, for the same reason that our civil-rights laws have taken acts that are completely lawful in general-- We have a employment-at-will doctrine in this society, which basically means an employer can refuse to hire somebody or can fire somebody for any reason at all, except... [that] you may not refuse to hire, you may not fire, because of these invidious classifications: race, gender ... So, if you take something that is already a crime, it is completely fair and rational for society to say, 'This is a more serious crime, given the problems of discrimination.'"</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Taking all that into consideration ... are we being hornswoggled?" And we're off on a delicious romp through the world of modern art, starting with a photograph of Pristine Vacuum Cleaner by Jeff Koons, which Mr. Buckley asks his guest to describe. MS: "That is something called a Shop-Vac, which I am sure many viewers have in their garage as we speak. That happens to be a new, virginal Shop-Vac. Never been used. I can't remember the precise price. I think it was $500,000 or $600,000... Now what makes it different from your Shop-Vac? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all other than that it has been declared a piece of art by Mr. Koons, and certainly by Mr. Koons's dealers, and, more remarkably, by some of the most distinguished critics."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

TG: "What Bush did through his term was to say, 'Listen, we're going to enforce these [immigration] laws. We're going to enforce them in a respectful way, but a country has a right to enforce its borders.'..." WFB: "What were the Democrats saying at the same time?" TG: "Well, the national Democrat, I think, was trying to use it as an issue that separated Hispanics from the positions Republicans were taking. What is somewhat offensive is that it suggests that there are no distinctions between Hispanic-Americans--Mexican-Americans--and people who don't share the rights that accrue to citizens."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

I think the recent victory in November was a George W. Bush victory." In fact, the show winds up being largely an encomium to Mr. Bush that conservatives will find both heartening and disturbing: "The first thing that Governor Bush did when he was elected four years ago, he embraced the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Bob Bullock, and the Speaker of the House, Pete Laney, and put his arms around both of those very powerful men in Texas government and stayed there throughout the entire session. ... He was a very good bi-partisan governor during the past four years. ... I don't think Republicans run government as well as the Democrats do. And I think George Bush perhaps could change that, because he's not going to be as far to the right and as anti-government as some of the other Republican candidates."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

That was midway through John Lindsay's time in office, and Mr. Lindsay and his successor, Abe Beame, did their best to prove Mr. White correct. Then Ed Koch took over, followed by Rudy Giuliani (with one term of David Dinkins in between as a salutary warning), and things were looking up--in fiscal terms, in terms of crime, and in terms of esprit de corps. Mayor Giuliani begins, in his hard-edged way, with a provocative sidelight on why Republicans are doing so well as mayors (of Los Angeles and Indianapolis, among other cities): "You're free of all of those special-interest groups that [machine politicians] have to give a piece of [their] agenda away to. So that if you can get...elected, you can actually accomplish something that's different than what has been going on for the last forty or fifty years." Then on to marijuana, President Clinton, and much else.</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

In 1998, while visiting London, he was arrested pursuant, as Mr. Buckley phrases it, "to a motion by a Spanish judge to extradite him to answer to crimes against humanity." The world community had mobilized, and we hear today from eloquent spokesmen for the two sides. MD: "Does that not leave you sleepless at night? That theory of justice, that any country in any jurisdiction is competent to do this?" KR: "Well, what would leave me sleepless is...Let's imagine that Hitler lived and decided to start traveling in the south of France, the Italian Riviera, and these courts, these nations, could do nothing to arrest him because this theory of universal jurisdiction would not be accepted by you..." MD: "We're not just legally arguing here. We're talking about someone who did (a) make life for the population in his country very much better, (b) step down and leave it a democracy."

These two guests have gone at it before on Firing Line, and Mr. Buckley, as referee, keeps them down to a dull roar. SZ: "Bibi [Netanyahu] got elected not to destroy the peace process but in order to make it work, but he has done that. Every pullback that he was supposed to do was all conditioned on [the Palestinians] doing what they said they would do. But it's not looked at that way from the State Department or the White House...." RH: "The problem with Bibi was that he was unable to keep all the promises he made, because every day he made different promises. He made promises to the United States, he made promises to the Palestinians, he made promises to the Israeli people and then promises to his coalition partners, who were made up largely of right-wing and nationalist forces." WFB: "And they were mutually incompatible?" RH: "They were all incompatible, and finally it blew up."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Host and guest start with President Clinton and, as Mr. Forbes puts it, "his abusing the power of the Presidency to destroy other people, their reputations, for the mistakes he made."

SF: "We're doing well compared to other countries.... We have a very strong economy; the fundamentals are very strong. But it's like Michael Jordan when he's playing basketball. The best player ever.

But let's let him tell it: "It was not only Norman Mailer but also John Updike rushed into print. These old men--and since I am about their age I can call them that--these old men who should be reserving their strength, conserving their energy, suddenly had to rise up from off of their pallets and try to shoot this book down. I think it was because I had predicted in 1973 ... that the future of the American novel, if it was to have a future, was in a highly detailed realism achievable only by reporting along the lines of what Zola meant when he talked of naturalism.... Suddenly this book... cast a shadow in the minds of people like Mailer and Updike, and they suddenly found themselves in the dark.

It is not, please note, a luxury tax, despite the title of his book (Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess): "The government is just not well equipped to decide what's a luxury and what's not a luxury. Suppose I'm a schoolteacher and I love to sail, and I want to buy a $100,000 sailboat, and I have saved all my life to do it and I buy a good one.

And sure enough, crime in New York City had dropped dramatically since the police started aggressively pursuing infractions such as "fare beating" on the subways, open drinking on the streets--and marijuana possession. A lively, sometimes heated, debate. HS: "If your premise is that there is something wrong with marijuana, then we should encourage not using it. We shouldn't encourage people to go out and continue to use marijuana, and legalization would do just that." LZ: "Look, I think there is something wrong with adultery, but I don't think the New York City Police Department should be out searching for adulterers."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

Comes now Mr. Rosenkranz, who in his book Buckley Stops Here: Loosening the Judicial Stranglehold on Campaign Finance Reform argued for overturning Buckley v. Valeo, which held that while the legislature could limit individual contributions it could not limit the amount a candidate (in this case, Senator James L. Buckley) could spend on his own behalf. Mr. Rosenkranz ably defends his position, but he has to contend not only with Senator Buckley's brother, but also with one of the nation's most formidable free-speech advocates. JR: "Corruption is not the only issue. It's also about equality, and what the Supreme Court took off the table is any argument that... voices should be about equal in the most important decisions that we make in our democracy, which is who should be elected to public office." IG: "You're right about that factually, but where we disagree is that, though I pine for more equality in speech as much as you do, what I am fearful of and what the Supreme Court was properly, I think, fearful of is allowing the government to decide that you have too much speech and I don't have enough."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

This fascinating session focuses on the legal and logistical implications, but Mr. Levy also offers a breathtaking explanation of exactly what we're talking about: "Here we have this cell, which is really too small for us to imagine, and there's the 3-billion-rung structure within each cell in our body, that's identical in every cell in our body and yet unlike that of any other individual on the face of the earth....

We might have thought nothing useful could still be said about this oversaturated story, but host and guests manage to put some of the details into perspective. JC: "There was a collusion going on between [Paula] Jones's attorneys, some of whom were a secret group of right-wingers,... and the prosecutor's office. And there's a real issue of whether that collusion was legitimate or not. I think it wasn't, and I think most people agree that it wasn't." ... WFB: "Who is responsible for the six-year campaign of vicious smears designed to destroy the Clintons?" JRA: "Actually, the Clintons.... The Clinton White House, which has continually delayed, obstructed the investigation,... denied documents, hidden documents ... I am committed to the Whitewater story itself. I think Lewinsky was a distraction and a symptom of the triviality of the press. But I think the story about the original attempt to squelch federal investigations of the savings-and-loan in which the Clintons were involved is the real story.

Before Miss Tureck sits down at the keyboard, she and Mr. Chapin talk buoyantly about the difference between listening to music live and on recording, the history of the widespread availability of professional-quality music, and--something new--the reintroduction of an arts curriculum in New York City's public schools. WFB: "You're optimistic, then, about the impact of the restoration of the arts in New York?" SC: "I am, absolutely.... New York, which was the pits in terms of arts education, in the last two and a half years has become the national urban leader.... Nobody said it better than Rudolph Giuliani when he made the announcement about this: that [the arts] are as important as the sciences and as important as the other humanities." WFB: "And you expect to be able to document that, say, ten years from now?" SC: "Absolutely. If we're wrong, than we really have a problem in education. But I do not think we are wrong."

The Serbians, under their dictator Slobodan Milosevic, had attacked in force to prevent Kosovar secession. What should we--America, but also the West generally--be doing? Mr. Buckley and Father Neuhaus engage in a profound examination of the moral criteria--which include the practical criterion of, Will your policy achieve what it intends? RJN: "There are clear criteria as to what constitutes a just war and what constitutes justifiable actions within the context of a war.... I am afraid that if one looks very carefully at what we have done over the last seven or eight years in Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, but particularly now with respect to this present intervention, this bombing, where we're dropping bombs into a thousand years of passionately entangled history in the Balkans, it doesn't meet any of the criteria of a justified war."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Whatever conservatives may have thought about some of Mr. Kissinger's policies, his analysis is superb: "[Nixon] has some personality aspects--I don't know from what they derived, since I only met him after he had been elected-but he had a great fear of being rejected face to face. He had a need to affirm himself with dramatic statements.... And all of these tendencies come to appearance in the tapes.... He was perfectly capable of firing off a string of orders which those who knew never would have carried out.... You can read some bloodcurdling pronouncements [see Theodore H. White on the Enemies List, Firing Line s0192]. But what is never pointed out is, none of them was ever carried out. And none of the people who heard it said, 'Yes, Mr. President, we'll do it tomorrow morning.'

Professor Galbraith thereupon changed his working title, and his book is now called Name-Dropping. A neat job of disarming his critics." While this show has some of the customary Buckley-Galbraith backchat, our host mostly encourages his guest to reminisce about his more than sixty years on the public scene. JKG: "Adlai was very much averse to anything that might be called rabble-rousing, anything which had a wider public appeal." WFB: "Was there a sharp distinction between his voice to the public and FDR's?" JKG: "Very much, yes. FDR would identify himself much better with the American public as a whole than could Adlai Stevenson. He was also much more susceptible to suggestion, recommendation.

SF: "Right now we are in a situation where we are seeing enormous improvement in our schools, and placing blame or pointing fingers isn't going to help us continue with that improvement..." SS: "There is a certain segment of our school population that is doing terribly.

Mr. Glasser and the ACLU have called for federal intervention on the grounds that some of these practices are racist. Mr. Bratton defends himself ably in this lively and informative exchange. WB: "A lot of what I was about as police commissioner... was that over time we might be able to turn the attitude of police from seeing every black man they see in the street as a potential threat to them, to a situation where it requires much less police intervention in, particularly, minority communities, because there is a lot less crime and disorder happening. And then, over time, that might begin to have some impact on the issue of race in this country, because the most significant flashpoint between the races is police activity in minority communities...." IG: "It is fair to say that black people in this country, like white people, have a legitimate fear of crime and want there to be effective law enforcement." WFB: "They are the principal beneficiaries of it." IG: "But the fact is that many black people are as afraid of cops as they are of criminals.

This conversation with a man who has spent his adult life studying the Soviet Union and related matters may not yield ultimate answers, but it gives us a way to think about human rights and the First World's responsibilities.

Say there are violations of human rights in Africa. Those countries in Africa which are concerned with human rights should intervene, but it should not be up to the United States or to Europe.

Mr. Schundler ran for the office and won, becoming the first Republican mayor of Jersey City since World War I. Most viewers will be meeting him for the first time on this show, and the Republicans among them should be greatly interested in this engaging young star. Mr. Schundler: "The reason I changed from being a Democrat and became a Republican: I was a Democrat because as a Christian I feel that government, should be concerned, as the Scripture puts it, about the least of these. We should be out there trying to make sure that every American who is born has a decent chance to live on a safe street, has a chance to get a good education, has a chance to realize their dreams. And the Democrats' rhetoric is so wrapped up in that idea of being there for the underdog.... But then, working with the party, I became convinced over time that they didn't care about whether the programs were working or not. What they cared about were the interest groups who were invested in the programs.... I became a Republican because I saw people talking about changing the way programs operate to make them actually work."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

WFB: "Suppose I call in a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist says, 'I've known Mrs. Shaughnessy for years, and I detected two months ago a kind of frenzied fear that if she had another child it would simply ruin her life.... I therefore counseled removal of the child.' How do you handle that?" RPG: "Well, if the child is viable, the child can be removed without killing the child. That's the very definition of viability. The case should be treated no differently than you would treat a case of a woman who has a baby-let's say a month-old baby-who is experiencing severe postpartum trauma; the existence of the baby is bothering her and indeed causing psychological harm.... The answer is not to kill the baby. The answer is to attend to the needs of the woman."</p><p> Availability: Special order, please contact the Archives.

This statement caused apoplectic denunciations in Peking, and apoplectic denunciations in Washington, the nostalgic fiction having endured for fifty years that Taiwan and China are a single country." This proves to be a low-key but highly informative discussion of the local history, parallels elsewhere (e.g., East and West Germany, North and South Korea), and future possibilities. WL: "The overwhelming majority of the Taiwan people--every poll shows 80 to 85 per cent prefer the status quo. Some of those say, 'Status quo indefinitely,' some of them say, 'Status quo and then some day maybe reunification,' some say, 'Status quo and some day independence,' But what they recognize is they have de facto independence....

President Clinton had vowed to veto any such bill. To help us sort out the economic and political considerations, we have a man who can certifiably crunch numbers, but who also can speak concretely of the people behind the numbers. LK: "Twenty years ago the U.S. was going down the road to becoming a welfare-dependent, government-dependent country. Today we have completely changed and transformed that culture, and we have become a nation of asset holders and investors and web-site owners and small-business people. Those folks want to be left alone. They're willing to exercise their own personal responsibility. They accept risk and they don't want government in the way."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Mr. Koch: "He is a mean-spirited person. And let me say this: I like him personally--I mean, in conversation, one to one, he is a charming person, and I don't regret the fact that I was one of four people who made it possible for him to win the first time." But, says the former mayor, Mr. Giuliani has a personality flaw that has undercut much of the good he has done (as when, for example, he fired Police Commissioner Bratton because he "was getting part of the credit" (cf. Firing Line #S1206) and that would unfit him for the Senate (this being before Mr. Giuliani's campaign to oppose Hillary Clinton for Daniel Patrick Moynihan's old seat disintegrated): "The fact is that Giuliani cannot work in the Senate because he can't work with anybody.

His likelihood of getting there is somewhere between impossible and inconceivable. But then, by statistical arithmetic, that's true of most candidates for that office." And, Mr. Bauer replies, "Miracles do happen in politics." As we know, that particular miracle didn't pan out, but the discussion gives us a good perspective on the current scene. GB: "I don't think my candidacy should be thought of as Christian-oriented. My whole life has been devoted to public policy. There have been Christian candidates that define themselves that way, Pat Robertson being the most notable example. But all my life I've worked on public policy.... So I don't think voters should feel excluded at all. I think what they are looking at is a Reagan conservative who also feels strongly about his Christian faith."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

In any case, WFB is moved to ask:" Should he take advantage of the questions raised to look at the drug laws and to propose reform?" This fast-paced conversation alternates between (from Mr. Glasser) the rights and wrongs of the drug laws per se and (from Mr. Morris) the political implications. DM: "I think George Bush got--in a way that nobody else in the political world got and very few journalists understood--that it wasn't a question of, The public didn't want to know. It was a question of, The public wanted not to know. Because the average voter, particularly young parents trying to raise children, were a lot less interested in whether the next President ... had ever used cocaine than in making sure their own children didn't come to them and say, 'Hey, I'm going to use some cocaine; Bush did.'"... IG:"He seems to say, 'I believe in redemption; I believe in overcoming youthful errors.

Bush, to pump-prime private philanthropy through government action. WFB: "When Reagan left office, 19.8 per cent of GDP was going into the Federal Government. It's now 21.8. That's a very substantial rise. So that notwithstanding what Mr. Clinton said, that the age of big government is over, in fact, government continues to swell, right?" WES: "The fact of the matter is,... you have to work until May now before you keep your own money. May 11, I think it was last year. Now think of that! You are working five months for government before you can work for yourselves. That's too much right there, so let's not talk about more of a government bite, more of a government take on anything."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

One sample: WFB: "People who have read your book ... are now referring to it as the great answer to Al Gore's book. I mean, it's a lot of other things too, but is it correct that you sort of take him on pretty directly? ..." PH: "The book wasn't written with the express purpose of debating our Vice President, but I do think his book bears re-reading by people who want to see just how silly--forgive me, but just how silly modern environmentalism can get. Where it is coherent, and it often isn't, it really puts forward a conception of things and where our society is going that is tremendously gloomy and pessimistic, and it seems to me refuted, where it's concrete enough to be refuted at all, by all the available evidence and empirical trends in recent history."</p><p> Availability: Not available.

These two shows--this one focusing on domestic policy, the following one on foreign policy--each feature a major figure from the 20th century and an up-and-comer for the 21st. This one suffers slightly from the fact that, because it was election day, our guests are beamed in via satellite. But what the conservation lacks in give-and-take, it makes up for in substance. CC: "Politics is the business of talking to people--if you can, one at a time, or alternatively in reasonably small groups so that there is still a personal message. And that's why affiliation politics will always remain important, even in a country such as ours, where we stress the importance of looking at every person as an individual and not as a member of some group or class. We want people to be completely mobile, as a matter of policy, between what other cultures might define as classes--we don't--and among groups." ... HJH: "We're in a political situation where the Democrats have expressed themselves as not wanting to legislate. They really have a vested interest in not passing legislation, blaming us as a do-nothing Congress, and using that canard to vault themselves back into power.... So we have to not only get ourselves excited about legislation, but we have to persuade a few Democrats to join us so we can pass something.""</p><p> Availability: Not available.

Big themes are dealt with in a serious way that it is hard to imagine any other television show replicating in the near future. FZ: "I think the broader shift is probably not ethnic but generational....I think Americans now in their fifties, sixties, and seventies grew up in a world in which their personal lives became interconnected with the great events of history--through World War II, through the Marshall Plan, through NATO, through the Korean War. They felt a connection between what they were doing personally and these events. Americans of subsequent generations, particularly Americans of my generation [Mr. Zakaria was born in 1965],...having grown up in times of peace and prosperity, feel themselves utterly unconnected with these broader events..." HK: "Your point is: Can foreign policy be internationalized to a point where sovereignty becomes less important, in a sense, than some international standard by which you can intervene in cases that occur within the territory of another state? I think it's important to remember that the doctrine of sovereignty arose at the end of the religious wars of the 17th century, in which borders had become very permeable and millions were killed in pursuit of abstract justice by one side or the other....Of course there are outrages of a kind that probably demand international intervention. But as a general proposition, I believe that the present definition of so-called humanitarian intervention is arbitrary."</p><p> Availability: On amazon.com.

The discussion mostly revolves around the funding of student groups through compulsory student-activity fees, but along the way it turns to the use of tax money in general, public goods versus private goods, and the idea of community. Mr. Downs: "And I think it is unconstitutional that ... students like us be forced to pay student-activity fees." WFB: "I pay fees every day to that terrible man in the White House, who, you know, sort of spills my little pennies around and other people's. Why should that be a collective enterprise in a sense that this ought not to be?" Ms. Powers: "Indirectly you had a say in electing Bill Clinton, and--" WFB: "Well, but you have a vote in whether to come to Ole Miss or not, right?" AP: "Right, and I am agreeing with you in that respect because... especially at Ole Miss our student-activity fees are funneled through the associated student body ... So long as you have that representative democracy, I don't think that you can argue against the activity fees."</p><p> Availability: Not available.
