            <p>Born in Baghdad, Kanan Makiya left Iraq to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and later returned to join Makiya Associates to design and build projects in the Middle East. In 1981, he left the architecture field and began to write a book about Iraq. 
                <title render="italic">Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq</title> (1989) became a best-seller after Saddam Hussain's invasion of Kuwait. Makiya's second book, 
                <title render="italic">The Monument</title> (1991) is an essay on the aesthetics of power and kitsch. Both 
                <title render="italic">Republic of Fear</title> and 
                <title render="italic">The Monument</title> were written under the pseudonym Samir al-Khalil. His next book, 
                <title render="italic">Cruelty and Silence: War, Tyranny, Uprising and the Arab World</title> (1993), was published under Makiya's own name.</p>
            <p>In 2000 Makiya published 
                <title render="italic">The Rock: A Seventh-Century Tale of Jerusalem</title>, a work of historical fiction that tells the story of the building of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Along with these books, Makiya has written for 
                <title render="italic">The Independent, The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement</title> and 
                <title render="italic">The Times</title>. Makiya also published on the architecture of Mohamed Makiya
                <title render="italic">Post-Islamic Classicism: An Essay on the Architecture of Mohamed Makiya</title>.</p>
            <p>Makiya has been profiled in many books and publications including 
                <title render="italic">The New Yorker</title> (January 6, 1992) and 
                <title render="italic">The New York Times Magazine</title> (October 7, 2007). He has collaborated on several films for television, the most known of which exposed for the first time the 1988 campaign of genocide in northern Iraq known as the Anfal. The film, originally aired in January 1992 on the BBC, was shown by 
                <title render="italic">Frontline</title> in the U.S. under the title "Saddam's Killing Fields," and received the Edward R. Morrow Award For Best Television Documentary on Foreign Affairs for 1992. Makiya's books are available in many languages, including Arabic, French, Turkish and Spanish.</p>
            <p>In 2003 he founded the Iraq Memory Foundation, a NGO based in Baghdad and the US dedicated to issues of remembrance, violence, and identity formation. The Memory Foundation has collected and digitized nearly 10 million pages of Ba'th era documents and has been supported by both the Iraqi and US governments as well as many foundations. Makiya also continues to write, working on a historical fiction book set in Iraq between 2003 and 2006, titled 
                <title render="italic">The Rope</title>.</p>
