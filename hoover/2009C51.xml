            <p>Henderson, after earning a BA in sociology, went to Ethiopia from 1968 through 1971 as a Peace Corps volunteer, where he participated in design and building projects for the engineering section of the Ministry of National Community Development and Social Affairs. He designed and built several public works projects which fostered his interest in design.</p>
            <p>After Henderson returned to the United States, he attended design school at the California Institute of the Arts, where he received an MFA in design. Henderson then earned his master's degree in architecture from the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning at UCLA. He taught for ten years in the School of Architecture and Planning at the Catholic University of America.</p>
            <p>Inspired by his Peace Corps experience, Henderson remained involved in Ethiopian support and relief groups once he returned to the United States. He was an active member in the Ethiopian Project Research and Assistance Group (EthioPRAG), a group concerned with raising awareness about famine in Ethiopia and supporting scholarly research of possible solutions. He was also a member of the Bay Area Chapter of Friends of Ethiopia, where he actively tried to recruit and connect with other people who had lived in Ethiopia.</p>

                        <p>The Ethiopian Project Research and Assistance Group (EthioPRAG) was an American organization aimed at raising awareness and support for famine victims and improving the quality of life for people in Ethiopia. It took over a previous organization called the Ethiopian Famine Relief Organization of the Greater Bay Area, whose newsletters are included here. EthioPRAG's members consisted of Ethiopians and Americans who wanted to get involved to support Ethiopians. The group wanted to take a more active approach in their aid to Ethiopia, as well as concentrate on scholarly research focused on long-term solutions to drought and famine.</p>
                        <p>The folders contain EthioPRAG meeting minutes (mostly from 1987 and 1988), newspaper article reproductions, promotional material for EthioPRAG, and information about various conferences hosted by the organization. Brochures and descriptions of the organization are accompanied by personal notes from Henderson.</p>

                        <p>Friends of Ethiopia was a national organization formed in 1985. One of the main goals of the organization was to connect people in the United States who had lived or worked in Ethiopia so they could stay in contact with each other and keep current on events.</p>
                        <p>Materials are related to the Bay Area Chapter of the Friends of Ethiopia, with some promotional materials from the national headquarters. A fairly comprehensive collection of newsletters from 1985 through 1991 was kept, along with World News reports and scholarly publications. Other materials included are newspaper reproductions, personal notes, and correspondence related to the recruitment of members to the organization.</p>
