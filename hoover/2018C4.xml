            <p>Bai Chongxi (Pai Chung-hsi) was born in Guilin, Guangxi Province, into a Chinese Muslim family of Hui nationality. In 1921, after graduating from Baoding Military Academy, Bai joined Sun Yat-sen’s revolutionary movement. During the Northern Expedition of 1926 to 1928, which aimed at annihilating regional warlords and reunifying the whole of China, Bai served as the chief of staff of the Nationalist Revolutionary Army under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, moving and fighting in several provinces. For his battlefield exploits during the Northern Expedition, Bai was known as one of the great military strategists in Chinese history. From 1930 to 1936, with Li Zongren and several other prominent military and political leaders from Guangxi, Bai engaged in the program of building his home province into a model area in terms of economic development and administrative efficiency. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Bai was made deputy chief of staff of the Nationalist army, responsible for military training and operations. During the war, Bai assisted Li Zongren in defeating the Japanese in Tai’erzhuang in Shandong Province. He also commanded the Battle of Wuhan and defeated the Japanese in Guangxi Province.</p>
            <p>In 1946, Bai was appointed minister of national defense and assisted Chiang Kai-shek in waging war against the Chinese Communists. Shortly after the riot broke out in Taiwan in February 1947, Bai was sent as Chiang’s personal representative on a fact finding mission and to help pacify the populace on the island. By late 1948, the civil war went disastrously for the Chinese Nationalists and the Communist victory was only a matter of time. In January 1949, after Chiang resigned from presidency and Li Zongren became the acting President, Bai was responsible for building a solid Nationalist defense line along the Yangtse River. As the Nationalist governance in most of China was quickly disintegrating, Bai fought against the Chinese Communists in Central and Southwest China. In October 1949, Bai planned to make a last anti-Communist stand in Southern China and his home province of Guangxi. It went nowhere; at the end of the year he fled to Taiwan, where he spent the rest of his life.</p>
