            <p>Sergei Aleksandrovich Semeka was born in 1906 in St. Petersburg, Russia. After graduating from the Military Medical Academy in Leningrad, he served the rest of his life in the Soviet Army. Initially appointed as a regimental junior doctor, he rose to become the head of the Military Medical Administration during World War II. Specializing in the organization of medical services for the military in combat, he became one of the youngest generals in the military medical services in 1943, serving as the deputy director in the Department of Military Medicine of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR.</p>
            <p>After the war Semeka served as chairman of the Department of Military Medicine in several educational institutions and conducted extensive research in the history of Russian military medicine in the 17th and 18th centuries. Semeka died in 1966.</p>
