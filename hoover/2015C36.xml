            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The American naval, intelligence and foreign service officer William John Tonesk was born in 1906 as Władysław Jan Toniecki to a Polish immigrant family in Schenectady, New York. During the years 1925 to 1929, Tonesk studied English and economics, receiving his bachelor’s degree from Union College in Schenectady. He then worked for two years as a supervisor for the International Telephone and Telegraph in New York City. In 1931, he began graduate studies at Columbia University, receiving a master’s degree in English and East European studies the following year.</p>
            <p>Tonesk spent the next several years traveling and studying in Eastern Europe. While working on his dissertation on the Polish writer and philosopher Stanislaw Przybyszewski, Tonesk took a job with a travel agency, Raymond Whitcomb, Inc., as chief lecturer for global travel. He moved on to Pan American Airways in 1940; by 1943, Tonesk had moved to the Office of Naval Intelligence with the rank of lieutenant.</p>
            <p>Tonesk’s first station was Cairo, Egypt, where he established contact with the military intelligence of the Polish army of General Władysław Anders, an army made up of former Polish Gulag prisoners evacuated from the Soviet Union into the British-controlled Middle East. His next post was Moscow, where he worked as an interpreter for U.S. ambassador Averell Harriman. In the second half of 1945, Tonesk moved to Warsaw as aide to U.S. ambassador Arthur Bliss Lane. Soon after, he began working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
            <p>While in Warsaw, Lieutenant Tonesk organized the visits of General Dwight Eisenhower, in September 1945, and Herbert Hoover, in March 1946; most importantly, however, he studied the political situation in the country and reported to Washington. Tonesk grew increasingly disillusioned with U.S. intelligence authorities, so when Ambassador Lane quit in protest of the U.S. failure to confront Soviet aggression in Poland, Tonesk followed.</p>
            <p>After leaving the CIA in 1952, Tonesk served as a consultant to the Republican National Committee and directed public relations for the United States Travel Agency in Washington, DC. The election of Dwight Eisenhower encouraged him to return to government service via the United States Department of the State, first as a political officer and analyst in Washington and then, from 1956 to 1961, as consul and chief of a special intelligence research unit in Frankfurt, Germany. From 1961 until 1964, Tonesk served as deputy chief of protocol of the United States.</p>
            <p>During the Vietnam War era, Tonesk was first a liaison officer with the Economic Commission to Asia and the Far East and later the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand. In retirement, Tonesk consulted with multiple organizations and corporations regarding business ventures in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Far East. He also collaborated with his longtime friend and Polish émigré activist, Stefan Korboński, on multiple articles, letters, and editorials concerning the situation in Poland and the Solidarity movement. Tonesk passed away in March 1992 in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
