            <p>Radomir Luza was a Czech-American historian and poet, as well as a member of the anti-Nazi resistance in Czechoslovakia.</p> 
            <p>Luza was born on October 17, 1922 in Prague. Like his father, Vojtech Luza, Radmoir was a member of the partisan movement
                At the end of World War II, Luza began to study law at Masaryk University in Brno.  Due to his political beliefs, he was forced to go into exile and spent much of his life living in France and the United States.</p>  
            <p>During his exile in France, Luza continue his education at the Sorbonne and fully dedicated his life to academics, with a specific focus on the history of the Czech and German people.  
                During his time in the United States, he worked in New Orleans at Tulane University, while also being heavily involved in the International Union of Socialist Youth.</p> 
            <p>Post Velvet Revolution, Luza dedicated himself to the effort of restoring the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party and was widely recognized for his patriotic involvement in attaining party goals.  
                As a result, in the late 1990s he was awarded the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, which is presented to persons who have made outstanding contributions to the development of democracy and human rights.</p>
            <p>Radomir Luza died on November 26, 2009.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The collection covers two broad categories: family background and the Home Resistance during the World War II German occupation, and the period of Luza’s exile in France and the United States between March 1948 and 1990.</p>
            <p>The family documents are of particular interest and include the World War I diaries of  Vojtech Luza, Radomir Luza’s father. 
                The diaries begin in 1914 and focus mainly on Vojtech Luza’s stay in Siberia, where he was a member of the Czechoslovak legion in the fight against the Bolsheviks. 
                The diaries also describe some of his activities at the head of the Operation Section of the Czechoslovak General Staff between 1925 and 1926.</p>
            <p>The majority of the material in the second category relates to twentieth-century Czechoslovak history, 
                resistance movements in Czechoslovakia and Austria during World War II, socialism in Czechoslovakia, the International Union of Socialist Youth, 
                the post-war communist regime in Czechoslovakia, economic conditions in Austria, and Czech émigré affairs.</p>
            <p>The collection also includes unique written communications that were exchanged in the underground; correspondence, 
                including personal letters of prominent Czechoslovak exile politicians; speeches and writings; reports; memoranda; notes; transcripts of 
                radio broadcasts prepared by Radio Free Europe; interview transcripts; and printed matter.</p>
