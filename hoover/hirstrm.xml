            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The Ronald MacArthur Hirst papers consist largely of material collected and created by Hirst over the course of several decades of research on topics related to the history of World War II and the Cold War, including the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied landing at Normandy on D-Day, and the Berlin Airlift of 1948-1949, among other topics.</p>
            <p>Hirst, a World War II veteran who landed at Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day, began his research while working as a civilian employee of the U.S. Department of Defense, living alternately in West Germany and the United States in the early 1960s. His initial interest in the surviving German veterans of the Battle of Stalingrad led him to contact several of them in 1963, with the intent of collecting enough information from them to assemble a book of biographical vignettes of the various German commanders at Stalingrad. The project expanded in scope over time, as Hirst ultimately researched the fates of over 700 German participants in the battle and contacted hundreds of veterans or their families, regularly attending reunions of Stalingrad survivors and befriending or maintaining extensive contact with several key participants in the battle, such as Colonel Herbert Selle and Lt. General Arthur Schmidt, as well as family members such as the son of Field Marshal Friedrich von Paulus, among others. Hirst completed work on his 2,700-plus page manuscript, 
                <title render="italic">Three Scenes from Barbarossa</title>, in 1992, placing copies of this work in the libraries of several military repositories as well as the Hoover Institution.</p>
            <p>While employed at Lindsey Air Base in Wiesbaden, West Germany in the 1980s, Hirst became interested in the history of the Berlin Airlift, and in particular the stories of the 32 U.S. airmen who were killed during the course of that operation in 1948-1949. Hirst had noticed that several of these men were memorialized in streets that were named after them at Lindsey and the nearby Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, and his attempts to improve upon these street signs led him to research the lives of these men and contact surviving family members in the United States, with the goal of providing fitting memorials for each airman. In addition, Hirst organized trips to Germany for these families during the fiftieth anniversary commemorations of the airlift in 1998-1999. Following his retirement from government service, Hirst remained in Wiesbaden, and began research on further projects related to the Allied landing at Normandy in 1944. In particular, Hirst researched the role of the 9th Air Force in the invasion, documenting the story of its 26 advanced landing grounds in Normandy that were used during the invasion, and compiling a book titled 
                <title render="italic">A Guide to the Ninth Air Force Normandy Air Patches</title>. Hirst also organized several tours to Normandy for D-Day veterans during the 1990s, including one during the fiftieth anniversary commemoration in 1994.</p>
            <p>The Ronald MacArthur Hirst papers are arranged in series according to the projects that Hirst worked on, beginning with the Battle of Stalingrad. The 
                <emph render="bold">Stalingrad </emph>series contains a number of different subseries, beginning with the completed version of 
                <title render="italic">Three Scenes From Barbarossa</title> as well as manuscript drafts of the same work. This is followed by 
                <emph render="bold">Alphabetic Name Files </emph>of individual Stalingrad veterans. These files contain correspondence and various types of documentation about each veteran, and consist largely of correspondence with surviving veterans or with family members of veterans who perished at Stalingrad or in Soviet captivity. These files are arranged alphabetically by the name of the veterans that Hirst was researching, rather than the names of the people that Hirst contacted (such as family members, etc.), although in some cases this name was one and the same. An additional section of this subseries contains outgoing correspondence from Hirst to surviving generals or their families.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Stalingrad </emph>series also contains a subseries of 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence </emph>with historians, archivists, and others he encountered and shared information with during this project, as well as 
                <emph render="bold">Note Cards </emph>that are alphabetically arranged and that summarize the data that Hirst collected on each veteran. The 
                <emph render="bold">Photographs </emph>subseries consists largely of reproductions of photographs that were loaned to Hirst by Stalingrad veterans or their families, and the 
                <emph render="bold">Subject Files </emph>contain various types of materials collected by Hirst and arranged by topic. The subseries on 
                <emph render="bold">Veterans Associations and Veterans Memoirs </emph>contains correspondence, newsletters, documentation of reunions, regimental histories, and first-hand accounts of the battle by veterans.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Berlin Airlift Commemoration Files </emph>document Hirst's efforts to provide memorials for each of the American airmen who was killed during the course of "Operation Vittles," the airlift that provided food and other scarce supplies to the inhabitants of West Berlin during the Soviet blockade of that city from June 1948 through May 1949. The series is comprised of two parts: 
                <emph render="bold">Airmen</emph>, consisting of individual files on each of the American airmen who were killed during the airlift, including correspondence with surviving family members and research material about them, and 
                <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph>, which include correspondence from associations of airlift veterans, preparations for the tours that Hirst organized in 1998-1999, and research about crash sites and the airbases that supported the airlift, among other topics.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Normandy Operations Files </emph>series contains detailed information about each of the Advanced Landing Grounds (ALGs) of the U.S. Army's 9th Air Force, which comprised landing strips that were quickly built as the Allies gained territory around the initial beachhead in Normandy following D-Day. This series is comprised of several parts, beginning with the summaries of each ALG (also known as "air patches"), and then contains individual files on each ALG, made up of background research and correspondence. These are followed by sub-series containing correspondence files, arranged alphabetically by name of individual or organization, but also containing a sub-group of files arranged by individual towns in the départements of Manche and Calvados, in the areas near the sites of the ALGs. In addition, there are subsequent subseries of Subject Files and Veterans Files, with the latter group being further divided by veterans associations, memoirs and unit histories written by veterans, and newsletters of veterans associations. The Normandy series concludes with a group of miscellaneous research materials.</p>
            <p>The last series, 
                <emph render="bold">Other Research Projects Files</emph>, contains material pertaining to other areas of military history of interest to Hirst, and these files are arranged alphabetically by topic. Two areas of special interest to Hirst were the Battle of Remagen (Ludendorff) Bridge, in which Hirst fought in March 1945, as well as Lindsey Air Base in Wiesbaden, Germany, where Hirst was employed in the 1970s and 1980s. Hirst compiled a manuscript on the latter topic, documenting the history of the air base from its origins as a German army barracks in the latter years of the 19th century, up to the years prior to its decommissioning as a U.S. military base.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Oversized Materials </emph>are related to many of the above series, and consisting largely of photographs, maps, and architectural drawings, are shelved separately and listed in the last two boxes of this register.</p>
