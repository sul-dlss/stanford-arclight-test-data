            <p>Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) sponsored this series of political forums featuring candidates for statewide office in California and discussions of leading issues in cooperation with (in 1966, and possibly other years) the Pacific Service Employees Association, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (Local 1245), and the Engineers and Scientists of California for the thousands of PG&amp;E employees in northern and central California.</p>
            <p>From a "Politics '66" brochure about this series:</p>
            <p>"Informing P.G. and E.'s 23,000 employees who are scattered over 47 of California's 58 counties, and who are encouraged to take their individual citizenship privileges and responsibilities seriously is the broad objective of the "POLITICS '66" series. This has also been the objective of five such preceding series.</p>
            <p>"
                <emph render="italic">Register, work for, contribute to</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">vote for</emph> the cnadidates and party of choice is the theme of the Company's bipartisan, voluntary Applied Citizenship Training program of which the Politics Series is a part. The forums provide the vehicle by which citizen employees may learn for themselves through direct and indirect exposure to candidates and spokesmen on issues, the qualifications of office seekers and the merits of propositions.</p>
            <p>"The forums are held in the Company's General Office auditorium on the ground floor of 245 Market Street, San Francisco during lunch hours.</p>
            <p>"Many of the noon hour programs are filmed in their entirety using a multiple camera technique known as 'Live Camera,' which is similar to television except that the finished product is on 16 mm sound film. Additional prints are processed immediately for same day delivery via the Company's internal mail 'Pony Express' to various points in the system for screening in the operating divisions the following day.</p>
            <p>"Program Frequency: Generally a Tuesday-Thursday program schedule beginning mid-September and continuing to election day, with opposing candidates booked for appearances during the same week, is followed.</p>
            <p>"Program Format: Following a brief introduction the candidate or candidates are allowed up to thirty minutes to make their formal presentation. However, they must submit to ten to fifteen minutes of questions from the audience. Programs are concluded by 1:00 P.M.</p>
            <p>"Candidates or advocates of positions on propositions and their staffs may distribute campaign literature on the date of their appearance.</p>
            <p>"Each biennial series is concluded one week after the election with a panel of distinguished political analysts, commentators, and editors who 'post mortem' the several campaigns, review the returns, and respond to questions from the audience. Like the films of candidate appearances, the press panel prints are circulated among the Company's 13 operating divisions for viewing by employees and their friends.</p>
            <p>"Applied Citizenship Training Program: Since its inception in 1960, approximately 8,000 P.G. and E. employees have volunteered for and completed a 16 hour bi-partisan course in practical politics. Company sponsored, the ACT course has been warmly endorsed by Local 1245, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Engineers and Scientists of California.</p>
            <p>"California Good Citizenship Committee: This year P.G. and E. is cooperating with the California Good Citizenship Committee and a large number of other California firms in providing the means by which and encouraging employees to contribute financially to the candidates and party of their individual choice."</p>

                    <p>"Politics '62" and "Politics '66" were non-partisan political education programs designed to give Pacific Gas and Electric Company employees a chance to see and hear from the candidates for statewide office in California and to understand the issues in the elections of 1962 and 1966. The 1962 series was sponsored by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the Pacific Service Employees Association (P.S.E.A.). The 1966 series was sponsored by those organizations as well as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (I.B.E.W.) - Local 1245 and the Engineers and Scientists of California (E.S.C.). All programs are black and white except for the two programs covering the 1966 gubernatorial candidates.</p>

                        <p>In part 1 of 4 of this lecture, Eley discusses what he considers the great issue of our time, man vs. the state (or individual freedom vs. society's rights). He traces the history of the Fabian Society of London, which aimed to implement socialism in England via legislation, and the Labor Party in Britain. He explains how this concept came to the United States, covering the Public Ownership League, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, and the League for Industrial Democracy. This footage appears to represent highlights from a lecture course on politics and society that was framed around the question of the kind of society citizens want. Duration: 00:16:33.</p>

                        <p>In part 2 of 4 of this lecture, Eley explores the alternative to the collective state, which requires examining the manifest of responsibility. If we are to be free, we must focus on the individual. According to Eley, for those unable to maintain themselves, responsibility passes to the family, and from there to the church. Next in line after the church is local government, then state government, and lastly, federal government.

He asserts that while we as individuals are working hard, politicians are making decisions about the fruits of our labor, the future of our family members, and our freedom. He highlights Benjamin Franklin's understanding of freedom, which required responsibility, along with political participation.

Bergholz, syndicated columnist and political editor, Los Angeles Times. The panelists are introduced by the moderator, A. Ruric Todd. This is the final program in the "Politics '66" series, which was sponsored by PG and E in cooperation with the Pacific Service Employees Association, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - Local 1245, and Engineers and Scientists of California.
