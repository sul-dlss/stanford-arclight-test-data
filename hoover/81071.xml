            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The papers of James Robert Huntley include diaries, writings, correspondence, reports, notes, meeting materials, resolutions, statements, and printed matter related to political, economic and cultural relations among Atlantic community countries and Japan, and private promotion of international cooperation, international education, and international environmental protection.</p>
            <p>During his youth, Huntley was concerned with a shift in world politics towards dictatorships and war. After studying international relations at the University of Washington, he accepted an appointment with the United States Foreign Service in 1952. He was stationed in Germany, involved in democratic education and the solidification of German and United States relations. In 1960, Huntley left the United States Foreign Service to found the Atlantic Institute in Paris, a think tank created to study the problems of Allied cooperation and conflict.</p>
            <p>In 1974, Huntley accepted a research fellowship at the Battelle Memorial Institute, traveling to Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand to study the Atlantic-Pacific system. While in this role, he authored 
                <title render="italic">World Politics in the 1980s</title>, which was printed privately for Battelle's corporate clients. Correspondence, project proposals, and other materials related to the Battelle Memorial Institute can be found throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Huntley founded organizations for furthering democracy and the Atlantic community, including the Mid-Atlantic Clubs, the Standing Conference of Atlantic Organizations, the Consortium for Atlantic-Pacific Affairs (CAPA), and the International Standing Conference on Philanthropy (INTERPHIL). He also served in leadership roles for many such organizations, including as president of the Atlantic Council of the United States. In 1979, Huntley co-founded the Committees for a Community of Democracies (CCD), a group committed to strengthening relationships among democracies. In 1992, the Association to Unite the Democracies embarked on the Next Century Initiative (NCI), which was based on the ideas of the Committees for a Community of Democracies and involved many of its early members. The NCI became incorporated as a separate group, eventually becoming the Council for a Community of Democracies. The collection documents Huntley's involvement in these organizations through correspondence, meeting minutes, and extensive notes Huntley wrote about his career.</p>
            <p>Huntley kept a diary spanning more than fifty years of his life. His diary entries begin in 1952, the year he was hired by the United States Foreign Service. These diaries, along with a draft of his memoirs, can be found in box 24.</p>
            <p>The collection also includes Huntley's speeches and writings concerning democracy, the Atlantic community, international education, and Japan. In 1998, Huntley authored 
                <title render="italic">Pax Democratica</title>, in which he argued that democratic countries should work together to create a more peaceful world. Drafts of this book and of other influential works, such as 
                <title render="italic">Uniting the Democracies</title>, can be found throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>Huntley was interested in international education, writing many articles on the subject. Materials on international education include networking dossiers, documenting Huntley's interaction with various education organizations. The collection also includes files containing materials related to non-governmental organizations, which contain questionnaires recording basic information about the organizations, descriptions of their activities, and use of budgets.</p>
