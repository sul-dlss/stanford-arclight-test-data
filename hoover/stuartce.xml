                    <p>One of the first moving pictures filmed in the Soviet Union by a foreigner, 
                        <title render="italic">Soviet Russia Through the Eyes of an American</title> was filmed by Charles Edward Stuart, an internationally recognized American mining engineer engaged by the Soviets under their first five-year plan. The film is a travelogue directed by Stuart and narrated by radio personality Norman Brokenshire. Filmed in cities and villages and from trains, river steamers, and bus caravans, the travelogue journeys southward from Moscow to Kharkov and Stalingrad, to the Crimea in the Black Sea, and, finally, eastward through the Caucasus to Tbilisi in Georgia. During the 1930s, the film was shown in commercial theaters in the United States and was used by Stuart in conjunction with lectures to university audiences throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>In 1985, R. C. Raack, professor of history and cataloger of historical documentary films at the University of California at Hayward, completed an appraisal of the Stuart film. Believing that the footage was shot between 1926 and 1930, Professor Raack states, in part, "In the documentary film world the footage compiled by Mr. Stuart must be regarded as remarkable because it shows Moscow before the first five-year plan, lively, thriving, almost prosperous. We also have remarkable scenes of Kharkov, perhaps just before 1930, showing some of the remarkable achievements of Soviet architecture before the disasters of complete Stalinization. This city footage and more from Soviet Georgia are the most impressive parts of the material."</p>
