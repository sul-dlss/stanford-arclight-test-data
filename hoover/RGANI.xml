      <head>Scope and Content of the Microfilm Collection</head>
      <p>This collection concerns political conditions in the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991. The
        documents come from three Russian archives. Material was selected for microfilming based on
        two criteria: (1) records of the highest policy-making units of the Communist Party were the
        priority; and (2) record series were filmed in their entirety, rather than selecting only
        particular files or documents (except for some of the Gulag material in GARF) <emph
          render="italic">Fond</emph> R-9414).</p>
      <p>To locate material in the collection, it helps to know that archival documents in the
        former Soviet Union, and later in the Russian Federation, are arranged in record groups
        according to the institution that issued or received them. These major groups, which
        sometimes include thousands of documents, are called in Russian <emph render="italic"
          >fond</emph> (plural <emph render="italic">fondy</emph>). Within each <emph
          render="italic">fond</emph> the documents are generally divided into smaller groups called
          <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> (singular <emph render="italic">opis</emph>). <emph
          render="italic">opisi</emph> are generally organized according to the internal structure
        of the corresponding institution, but sometimes <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> consist
        of documents relating to one subject. The Russian word <emph render="italic">opis</emph> has
        two meanings: (1) a series of documents; and (2) a finding aid. Each <emph render="italic"
          >opis</emph> "series of documents" is provided with a descriptive <emph render="italic"
          >opis</emph> "finding aid." Each <emph render="italic">opis</emph> "series of documents"
        is further organized into files called dela (singular delo) that contain the documents.</p>
      <p>Out of a total of 11,818 microfilm reels, 11,349 reels contain documents and 469 contain
        finding aids to the <emph render="italic">fondy</emph> available at the Hoover Institution,
        as well as to some <emph render="italic">fondy</emph> available only in Russia. Each reel of
        microfilm contains approximately 850 pages, or frames.</p>
      <p>The microfilm reel numbers consist of two parts separated by a period, for example 3.427.
        The first numerical segment is a 1, 2, or 3, identifying the Russian archive source; 1 is
        RGANI, 2 is RGASPI, and 3 is GARF. The second segment, which is sequentially numbered
        starting with 1, represents a specific microfilm reel number for that Russian archive.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content of the RGANI Records</head>
      <p>Materials described in this document are from the Russian State Archive of Contemporary
        History (Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyĭ arkhiv noveisheĭ istorii - RGANI).</p>
      <p>Finding Aids to <emph render="italic">Fondy</emph> 4, 5, 6, 8, and 89 at RGANI (15 reels).
        These Russian-language finding aids were created by RGANI to describe documents in fondy
        4-6, 8, and 89. Only the documents in <emph render="italic">fondy</emph> 6 ( <emph
          render="italic">opisi 1-6</emph>) and 89 are available on microfilm at the Hoover
        Archives.</p>
      <p>The documents of <emph render="italic">Fond</emph> 6 include materials from the Party
        Control Commission of the TsK VKP(b), 1934-1952; the Party Control Committee of the TsK
        KPSS, 1952-1962; and the Party Commission of the TsK KPSS, 1962-1966.</p>
      <p>The records of <emph render="italic">Fond</emph> 89, Communist Party of the Soviet Union on
        Trial records, 1918-1992, consist of documents submitted to the Constitutional Court of the
        Russian Federation for the trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is organized by the name of the Russian archive that holds the original
        materials. There are three finding aids for the collection, one for each one of the Russian
        Archives: <list type="simple">
          <item>-Russian State Archive of Contemporary History (Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyĭ arkhiv
            noveisheĭ istorii - RGANI);</item>
          <item>-Russian State Archives of Social and Political History (Rossiiskii gosudarstvennyĭ

            Federat͡sii - GARF). </item>
        </list></p>
      <p>Within Russian institutional archive, the materials are organized into two groups: (1)
          <emph render="italic">fondy</emph> (record groups consisting of documents); and (2)
        finding aids that describe each <emph render="italic">fondy</emph>. <emph render="italic"
          >Fondy</emph> are usually subdivided into <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> (series of
        documents); the number of <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> in each <emph render="italic"
          >fondy</emph> varies.</p>

          <p>The Central Control Commission was reorganized into the Party Control Commission (KPK)
            of the TsK VKP(b) in February 1934 at the XVII Party Congress. The Party Control
            Commission was established to work between party congresses. At congresses the structure
            and responsibilities of the Commission were defined. The Party Control Commission of the
            XVII Congress had control over the fulfillment of decisions of the TsK VKP(b) and of the
            Party and brought to account those guilty of violations of party discipline and party
            ethics.</p>
          <p>The work of the Commission was organized as follows:</p>
          <p>1. KPK Plenum</p>
          <p>2. KPK Bureau</p>
          <p>3. KPK Secretariat</p>
          <p>4. KPK Party Collegium</p>
          <p>5. KPK teams for various branches of Soviet economic and cultural development</p>
          <p>6. KPK representatives to republics, krais, and oblasts</p>
          <p>The plenum was the KPK governing organ until 1936; from 1936 the KPK Bureau, whose
            members were to be approved by the TsK VKP(b), headed the KPK.</p>
          <p>The KPK Collegium reviewed complaints filed against decisions of local party organs. To
            facilitate the resolution of complaints, a three-member party body (tro&#301;ka) was
            appointed to review them. Sometimes tro&#301;ka members went to the locality where those who
            filed the complaint lived.</p>
          <p>The KPK Secretariat managed the work of administrative personnel.</p>
          <p>Fifteen teams within the KPK controlled the activities of people's commissariats and
            departments.</p>
          <p>The KPK appointed representatives to the republics, krais and oblasts to control the
            fulfillment of party decisions by local party, economic, and Soviet organizations.
            Attached to each KPK Representative was a three-member party body (tro&#301;ka) approved by
            the KPK. The tro&#301;ka investigated cases relating to violations of party discipline and
            party ethics. The tro&#301;ka's decisions had to be approved by a KPK representative in the
            locality. Complaints against the tro&#301;ka's decision could be filed to the KPK of the TsK
            VKP(b).</p>

              TsK VKP(b), KPK and party collegiums and party tro&#301;kas in the republics, krais, and
              oblasts, as well as tro&#301;kas of the KPK Party Collegium that investigated complaints
              of those expelled from the party during the review of party documents that took place
              from February 1934 through March 1939 (912 files). Some protocols for the years
              1934-1939 were left in the archives building in 1941 during the evacuation and
              presumably were destroyed by paramilitary guards. Minutes No. 1-275 for the years
              1938-1939 were restored in 1967-1970 using excerpts from the minutes that were
              preserved by the TsK KPSS Sector of Unified Party Member Identification Cards of the
              TsK KPSS and in personal files. It is believed that not all items on the tro&#301;kas'
              agendas could be restored in full.</p>
            <p>The minutes are arranged chronologically. Minutes relating to each Plenum are
              arranged by number within the following six groups: </p>
            <p>1. Minutes and verbatim records of KPK Plenums</p>
            <p>2. Minutes of the KPK Bureau</p>
            <p>3. Minutes of the KPK Party Collegium</p>
            <p>4. Minutes of the party tro&#301;ka of the KPK Party Collegium</p>
            <p>5. Minutes of the party tro&#301;kas of the KPK Party Collegium and of KPK party
              collegiums in republics, krais, and oblasts</p>
            <p>6. Minutes of the Party Collegium and party tro&#301;kas of the KPK Party Collegium for
              review of complaints of party members expelled from the party during the documents
              review</p>
            <p>Materials of plenums include minutes and verbatim records, draft resolutions, notes
              by a main speaker at the Plenum, and other documents. Three versions of verbatim
              records have been preserved: the author's version, an edited typescript, and a printed
              copy. Meeting minute numbers and plenum minute numbers are the same.</p>
            <p>Minutes of the KPK Bureau were approved by the TsK VKP(b) Organizational Bureau.
              Minutes of the KPK Bureau have been preserved in two versions: the original and an
              identical copy. Each file includes a minute and supplementary material to this
              meeting.</p>
            <p>Documents are further arranged in a similar way: the original, a resolution, an
              attachment to the resolution, supplementary material, and a resolution adopted without
              a meeting, by interviewing Bureau members.</p>
            <p>Some protocols contain resolutions adopted by interviewing Bureau members and
              supplementary materials. Agenda items of the KPK Bureau marked as "Special Folder" are
              listed on the cover of a corresponding file.</p>
            <p>Resolutions adopted at the joint meetings of the KPK of the TsK VKP(b) and the Soviet
              Control Commission under the USSR Sovnarkom were written personally by V. Kuibyshev,
              head of the Soviet Control Commission and of the State Planning Committee (Gosplan).
              Separate files numbered 1-52 contain KPK Bureau decisions for May - October 1936
              relating to plans for revision of TsK VKP(b) and USSR Sovnarkom resolutions and
              materials removed from consideration at the KPK Bureau meetings.</p>
            <p>Minutes of the KPK Party Collegium containing items adopted by interviewing Bureau
              members are placed in files after the main minutes of the KPK Party Collegium.</p>
            <p>Minutes of the tro&#301;kas of the KPK Party Collegium were approved by the Party
              Collegium Secretary, and minutes reviewing complaints directed to the XVII Congress,
              by the KPK Bureau.</p>

            <p>4. Minutes of the tro&#301;kas of the KPK Party Collegium of TsK VKP(b) and of the KPK
              party collegiums in republics, krais and oblasts arranged geographically by location
              where appeals filed by individual party members and candidate members to the XVII
              VKP(b) Congress were first reviewed</p>
            <p>Between June 1939 and July 1940 there were two meetings of the KPK of the TsK VKP(b).
              During those meetings organizational issues relating to the work of KPK
              representatives were included in the agenda.</p>
            <p>A total of 235 minutes (the original and a copy of each) of the KPK Bureau for June
              1939 - September 1956 are included in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph>. Each minute with supplementary
              material makes a separate file. Minutes include resolutions adopted for each agenda
              item and supplementary materials on the basis of which the resolution was adopted.
              Minutes also include resolutions adopted by interviewing KPK Bureau members arranged
              chronologically by date of their adoption between meetings of the KPK Bureau. Agenda
              items marked as "Special Folder" and other materials with such a mark are listed on
              the file cover.</p>
            <p>A total of 1,353 minutes of the KPK Party Collegium have been preserved for the years
              1939-1952. Starting from the XVIII Congress each agenda item is amended by a statement
              compiled by a KPK staff member, with biographical data about the Communist whose file
              was under review and a brief description of the offense for which the party held this
              person accountable. Minutes of meetings with a short agenda are arranged in one file
              with statements; statements amending minutes of meetings with a long agenda were
              arranged in a separate file, with the minute number they refer to placed on the cover
              of the file.</p>
            <p>The last group of records in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> includes minutes of party tro&#301;kas of the Party
              Collegium of the TsK VKP(b) and of KPK party collegiums in the republics, krais, and
              oblasts relating to preliminary investigation of appeals by VKP(b) members and
              candidate members to the XVII Party Congress and withdrawn from <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 1 because their
              dates refer to the XVIII Congress. They include draft documents from personal cases of
              those appealing to the XVII Congress.</p>
            <p>The Party Control Commission was reorganized into the Party Control Committee of the
              KPSS (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) by resolution of the XIX Party Congress in
              October 1952. According to the KPSS Statute adopted at the XIX Congress, the Party
              Control Committee of the KPSS was responsible for controlling compliance of party
              members and candidate members with party discipline, bringing to account those
              violating the party program and party statute, and party and state discipline, as well
              as violators of party morale (deception of the party, dishonesty and insincerity
              toward the party, slander, bureaucratism, lack of discipline in everyday life, etc.),
              and reviewing complaints against decisions of the central committee in the union
              republics and party committees in krais and oblasts regarding expulsion from the party
              and other penalties incurred by party members.</p>

            <p><emph render="italic">Opis</emph> 4 includes minutes of the Party Control Committee of the TsK KPSS established at
              the XX Congress from February 1956 through October 1961 (total of 3,217 files). The
              structure of the Party Control Committee had not changed during the period between the
              XIX and XX Congresses. Each file includes one minute with additional information
              relating to it. <emph render="italic">Opis</emph> 4 also contains special minutes similar to those in <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 3 and
              arranged in the same way.</p>
            <p>Minutes of the Party Control Commission involving investigation of appeals to the XXI
              and XXII party congresses make up separate files. Appeals relating to restoration of
              party membership, elimination of a break in a party record, or repeal of party
              penalties make up a separate group of records. Minutes are supplemented by photocopies
              of the KPK of the TsK KPSS resolutions submitted to the Secretariat of the Congress.
              The originals are held in the Fourth Sector of the TSK KPSS General Department.</p>
            <p>The functions and structure of the Party Control Committee of the TsK KPSS did not
              change from the XXII Congress until November 1962. By a resolution of the November
              1962 TsK KPSS Plenum, the Committee of Party and Governmental Control of the TsK KPSS
              and the USSR Council of Ministers was established as a joint institution of party and
              governmental control. The Party Control Commission was reorganized into the TsK KPSS
              Party Commission responsible for reviewing complaints against decisions of the central
              committees in the union republics and party committees in krais and oblasts relating to
              expulsion from the party and other penalties incurred by party members.</p>

              TsK KPSS from October 1961 through April 1966 (total of 2,200 files). In connection
              with the reorganization of the Party Control Commission a new numbering of the minutes
              began in November 1962. It continued until the convocation of the XXIII Congress. The
              minutes in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> are arranged numerically. Each minute with an attached
              informational statement by a KPK staff member constitutes one file, except for the
              so-called "Special" minutes (see the description of <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 3 above).</p>
            <p>The KPK minutes relating to the review of appeals to the XXII and XXIII KPSS
              Congresses and to the review of expired appeals make a separate group of files. A
              letter "P" was added to heir numbers.</p>
            <p>The first group of files in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> consists of copies of minutes of the
              Secretariat of the XXII KPSS Congress relating to the review of complaints by those
              expelled from the party and against KPK of the TsK KPSS decisions submitted to the
              Secretariat of the congress. The originals are held in the Fourth Sector of the TsK
              KPSS General Department.</p>
            <p>The documents in <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 6 (total of 1,425 files) relate to the activities of the Party
              Control Commission of the TsK VKP(b) and the Party Control Committee and the Party
              Control Commission of the TsK KPSS from the XVII to the XXII Congress, from June 1939
              through October 1966. A small number of documents from the period between the XVII and
              the XVIII congresses were removed from this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> and placed in a secure location
              (spetskhran) in special holdings and thus have not been included in this opis.</p>
            <p>The tasks and functions of the Party Control Commission changed several times, and
              its title changed accordingly; this influenced the content of documents between the
              two congresses.</p>
            <p>The documents included in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> are as follows: reports about the activities of
              the Party Control Commission of the TsK VKP(b), the KPK Party Collegium of the TsK
              VKP(b), the Party Control Committee of the TSK KPSS, and the Party Commission of the
              TsK KPSS; statistical accounts of the review of complaints, surveys, and statements;
              data about the review of personal cases, letters, grievances, and applications from
              working people; memoranda to the TsK KPSS; and verbatim records and minutes of the KPK
              operational and business meetings. These materials reveal the activities of the KPK
              itself.</p>
            <p>In addition, this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> includes materials characteristic of the activities of local
              party collegiums and party commissions of central committees in the union republics
              and of party committees in oblasts and krais: reports, memoranda, and statements about
              the review of communists' personal files by local party institutions; as well as
              reports, letters, and informational material from KPK representatives in oblasts,
              krais, and republics about organizational party work led by local party institutions,
              about the situation in local industry, commerce, and agriculture, and about
              fulfillment of party and governmental resolutions by local institutions and
              enterprises. Based on these documents KPK staff members compiled statements, and
              subsequently resolutions were adopted by the KPK. These documents show how control
              functions were performed by local party control commissions.</p>

            <p>The documents in <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 6 are organized mostly chronologically, according to the party
              congresses' convocation. Materials after the XVII Congress were created from June 1939
              through January 1953, after the XIX Congress from October 1952 through February 1956,
              after the XX Congress from October 1956 through March 1962, and after the XXI Congress
              from August 1961 through October 1966. Within each time period between any two
              congresses the documents are arranged by their importance, as follows:</p>
            <p>1. Reports about KPK activities</p>
            <p>2. Statistical accounts of the review of appeals</p>
            <p>3. Surveys, data, and statements relating to the review of personal cases, and
              letters and applications from working people</p>
            <p>4. Memoranda to the TsK KPSS</p>
            <p>5. Verbatim records and minutes of KPK executive meetings</p>
            <p>6. Statements and surveys about measures taken in response to memoranda from KPK
              representatives arranged alphabetically by republic and thereafter by krai and oblast</p>
            <p>7. Materials submitted by KPK representatives in republic, krai, and oblast, arranged
              alphabetically by republic, and krai and oblast thereafter</p>
            <p>8. Statements submitted by KPK personnel regarding the work of party commissions
              attached to central committees of the union republics and to party committees in krais
              and oblasts</p>
            <p>9. Information about the activities of party commissions attached to central
              committees of the union republics and to party committees in krais and oblasts</p>
            <p>Almost all of these nine groups of records can be found, with slight variations,
              among materials for each time period between any two congresses. Some of the documents
              in this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> have been preserved in copies only, sometimes unsigned and undated. Such
              records include statistical accounts of the review of appeals, surveys, data, and
              memoranda. On some undated documents an approximate date is provided in brackets.
              Along with the annual KPK account of the review of personal cases and letters and
              applications from working people, this <emph render="italic">opis</emph> includes monthly accounts, which highlight
              KPK activities relating to certain issues.</p>
            <p>Within documents originated after the XIX Congress, in addition to the original
              copies, lists of complaints submitted to the XIX Congress of the VKP(b)against
              decisions of the Party Control Commission of the TsK VKP(b) were also included because
              the copies bear annotations about decisions adopted by the KPK.</p>
            <p>Documents included in <emph render="italic">opis</emph> 6 are of great historical value for those studying the
              work of the party control institution.</p>

          <p>Documents in <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> 1-76 are available on microfilm in the
            Hoover Archives. Russian-language finding aids are on microfilm reel number 1.988. An
            English-language, detailed descriptive list providing <emph render="italic"
            >opis</emph>number, file number, extensive description of documents in the file, and
            corresponding microfilm reel number is available in print and online. The print version
            is Archives of the Communist Party and Soviet State: <emph render="italic">Fond</emph>
            89, Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Trial (beige cover, softbound, 500 pages).
            The online version, which duplicates the detailed descriptions of the print version but
            omits the topical index on pages 1-23, is available here. A microfilm reel list, which
            provides <emph render="italic">opis</emph>number and corresponding microfilm reel
            number, is on page 19 of Finding Aids and Documents from the Three Key Archives on
            Microfilm (red cover, spiral bound, 130 pages)</p>
          <p>This finding aid describes the records of <emph render="italic">Fond</emph> 89,
            consisting of documents submitted to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation
            for the trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This unique collection of
            documents came into being as a result of President Yeltsin's decision on November 6,
            1992, to outlaw the Communist Party. This decision was challenged in the Constitutional
            Court. For the trial, government prosecutors drew on a wide range of documents emanating
            from the highest organs of the Soviet Communist Party and State. Covering the period
            1919-1992, the documents were selected to prove that the Communist Party showed a
            complete disregard for human rights and international law. They constitute the most
            revealing collection of documents of the Soviet Union to have emerged since its
            collapse.</p>
          <p>This finding aid describes over 3,000 documents in 10,000 pages, reproduced on 24 reels
            of microfilm. The records document a wide range of subjects, including Stalin's purges,
            the creation and operation of forced labor camps, the financing of foreign Communist
            parties, activities of organs of internal security such as the NKVD, relations with
            ethnic minorities in the former USSR, espionage and subversion of other governments,
            USSR's role in postwar Eastern Europe, among many other topics. The documents were drawn
            from a variety of sources: the Russian State Archives of Contemporary History (RGANI),
            the Archives of the President of the Russian Federation, the Archives of the Foreign
            Policy of the Russian Federation, the Archives of the Federal Security Service, the
            State Archives of the Russian Federation (GARF), the Russian State Archives of Social
            and Political History, the Russian State Archives of Economics (RGAE), and other
            archives. Brought together in a single collection, <emph render="italic">Fond</emph> 89
            is now a distinct record group in the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History
            (RGANI).</p>
          <p>The documents of <emph render="italic">Fond</emph> 89 available at the Hoover
            Institution Archives are organized into 76 record series (in Russian: <emph
              render="italic">opisi</emph>; singular, <emph render="italic">opis</emph>) <emph
              render="italic">Opisi</emph>, were established according to the order in which the
            documents were declassified and made available for research by the Russian Government,
            rather than according to subject content. Within each <emph render="italic">opis</emph>,
            however, the documents are organized into files according to subject. </p>
          <p>This guide describes the <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> in the order in which they
            have been organized and in which they appear on the microfilm. Each guide entry gives
            the microfilm reel number (first row) and the file number (second row). Because each
            file generally contains documents related to the same subject, the subject is described
            only once, and the rest of the documents are designated according to their physical
            form. The official positions of the leaders of the KPSS and of governmental officials
            have been added, when known, by the compiler. The names of the governmental and party
            institutions and of TsK KPSS (Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet
            Union) departments are given in English, except when they are widely known by their
            Russian abbreviations (e.g., TsK KPSS, KGB, NKVD, and so on). A list of the most
            commonly used abbreviations can be found in the glossary. Foreign institutions,
            organizations, publications, etc., are always provided with the name of the country to
            which they belong. Soviet (or Russian) institutions generally do not have this
            indication. In the text, entries for departments, directorates, committees, and
            commissions of party or governmental bodies or of social and political organizations
            always contain indications of the bodies to which they are subordinate (e.g. Department
            of Education, Culture, and Health of the USSR Cabinet of Ministers; Department of Awards
            of the USSR Supreme Soviet, etc.) If such designation does not appear, it is implied
            that this department, committee, or commission is subordinate to the TsK KPSS (e.g.,
            Ideology Department, Commission for Women and Children, etc). Foreign (non-Russian)
            names are given in English when the compiler could find their correct spelling in
            reference sources; otherwise, foreign names have been transliterated from Russian and
            presented in the text with a question mark.</p>
