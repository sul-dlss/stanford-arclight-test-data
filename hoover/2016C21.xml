            <p>Photocopies of speeches, writings, and correspondence of the American economist Milton Friedman, and recordings of his television appearances. Used as research material for 
                <emph render="italic">The Collected Works of Milton Friedman</emph>, compiled and edited by Robert Leeson and Charles G. Palm. The purpose of this project was the publication of all of Friedman's writings. It was originally sponsored by Palgrave Macmillan Limited, who planned to publish the materials as a multivolume set. The project was then sponsored by the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace after Palgrave withdrew. Much of the material has now been published online as part of the Collected Works of Milton Friedman website,
