            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The Hoover Institution acquired fifty-eight boxes of T. V. Soong papers from the Soong family in the 1970s. Of this material, thirty-nine boxes have been available for research since their acquisition. The other nineteen boxes were closed by the family during the lifetime of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who passed away on October 23, 2003. This finding aid describes the papers in those fifty-eight boxes (re-housed into fifty seven boxes for preservation in 2012).</p>
            <p>In 2004 the family donated additional Soong papers, which are described below as Incremental Materials. On April 26, 2004, the nineteen boxes of papers closed by the family since the 1970s and all of the papers acquired in 2004 were opened for research.</p>
            <p>The family could not authorize the release of security-classified government documents, which were present in both the original acquisition and the 2004 addition. The vast majority of these, including all classified documents in the original acquisition, were declassified by the U.S. government and opened in summer 2004. In January 2005, the declassified documents were returned to their original folders; a list of these folders follows this note.</p>
            <p>While the arrangement of folders and papers remains unchanged since the 1970s, the fifty-eight boxes in the original acquisition were renumbered in April 2004 and revised in August 2012. Originally organized as Schedule A, boxes 1-40, and Schedule B, boxes 1-18, the schedules were eliminated and the boxes numbered sequentially from 1 to 57. A box conversion chart is available upon request.</p>
            <p>As a standard archival preservation procedure, use copies have been substituted for original documents in some cases. All information contained in the original documents is open and available in the use copies. Upon request, the original documents may be viewed under direct supervision by archives staff.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note for the Incremental Materials</head>
            <p>Increments in the T. V. Soong collection were acquired in 2004 and 2006, when the Soong family descendents augmented the existing T. V. Soong collection at the Hoover Institution Archives.</p>
            <p>These incremental materials describe such turning points as the abduction of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1936 (the Xi'an incident), the dismissal of General Joseph Stilwell, and the framing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945. A major component of the collection includes T. V. Soong's notes, memoranda, confidential telegrams, financial records, and correspondence with Chiang Kai-shek and other government officials in China's wartime government. It also includes personal correspondence exchanged between members of the Soong family, including T. A. Soong, Soong Ai-ling (Madame H. H. K'ung), Soong Ching-ling (Madame Sun Yat-sen) and Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang Kai-shek). Selected telegrams in the T. V. Soong papers were transcribed and translated from Chinese to English and published in a bilingual edition as

            <p>The arrangement of this material has been closely maintained as it was received from the donors in 2004 and 2006. In some cases, as a standard archival preservation procedure, use copies have been substituted for original documents. All information contained in the original documents is open and available in the use copies. Upon request, the original documents, which comprise the Restricted Material series, may be viewed under direct supervision by archives staff. This series includes all restricted originals from boxes 1 to 64.</p>
            <p>The family could not authorize the release of security-classified government documents, which were present in both the original acquisition and the 2004 addition. The vast majority of these were declassified by the U.S. government and opened in summer 2004. In January 2005 the declassified documents were returned to their original folders. A list of folders containing declassified documents re-filed in January 2005 is available below.</p>
