            <p>Maximilian A. W. Boll was born on June 7, 1892 in New York, NY to parents born in Germany. He was drafted into the United States Army during World War I and fought in France against the Germans. During the war, he struggled with his German American identity and German prejudice in America. He was denied entry to officer school due to his German ancestry. During his time in World War I, he was a supply officer and frequently noted he felt more like an observer than a combatant. After returning from the war, he became secretary of the 315th infantry association. Maximilian A. W. Boll passed away on August 1st, 1980.</p>
