            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>George William Gahagan was born on June 22, 1912 in Toledo, Ohio. His family briefly lived in Indianapolis, Indiana, before moving to Goshen, New York, in 1927. He began studying at Dartmouth College in 1935, but did not complete his degree until 1949. He also briefly attended Harvard University as a graduate student, however, he received his MA from Stanford University in 1957. He married Lorna Jane Plump in 1939, with whom he had four children.</p>
            <p>Prior to World War II, Gahagan held a variety of different jobs. He worked as a reporter and columnist for the <emph render="italic">Times-Herald</emph> in Middletown, New York from 1935 to 1937, was an account executive at McGann-Erickson Advertising in San Francisco from 1937 to 1939, and worked as an editor for the McGraw Hill Publishing Company from 1939 to 1941.</p>
            <p>In 1943, Gahagan joined the San Francisco branch of the Office of War Information (OWI) as an information officer and later as a public relations officer with the Overseas Branch. He also served as a foreign press liaison officer at the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), the inaugural conference of the United Nations, which was held in San Francisco in 1945.</p>
            <p>In 1947, Gahagan left the OWI and returned to school, receiving his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1949. Following his graduation, Gahagan stayed at Dartmouth for another year to teach one of their Great Issues courses. While teaching there, Gahagan met and befriended poet Robert Frost, who was serving as Dartmouth’s Poet in Residence at the time. Gahagan later founded the organization California Friends of Robert Frost in honor of him.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1950s, Gahagan proceeded to teach, mainly history and English, at a variety of private, public, and parochial schools in Denver, Colorado, and in Monterey and Carmel, California. He also spent a few years in Rome teaching at the Overseas International School and serving as the director of the US Embassy Employees Association. In the early 1960s, Gahagan moved to Santa Barbara, California, where he served as assistant to the chancellor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1978, he moved back up the coast of California to Carmel, where he volunteered and served as an active member of a variety of community organizations until his death on December 8, 1998.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The G. William Gahagan papers consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports, photographs, motion picture films, printed matter, and wartime propaganda focusing on the analysis of Japanese propaganda and the preparation of American propaganda during World War II. The bulk of the material relates to Gahagan’s career with the Office of War Information (OWI) from 1942 to 1947, particularly his involvement with psychological warfare operations and wartime propaganda. A few examples of post-war American anti-communist propaganda are also included.</p>
            <p>To preserve the original order of the papers, war propaganda leaflets, pamphlets, and newsletters are dispersed throughout the collection. The majority of the material can be found under the Propaganda grouping in the 
                <emph render="bold">Office of War Information (OWI) File</emph>. Many of these items appear in other languages, some accompanied by English translations. A few examples of Japanese propaganda are also included in this section. Reports, including analyses of Japanese propaganda, memoranda, and other documents related to Gahagan’s work at OWI are also located in this series. Additional propaganda leaflets can be found in the Miscellaneous file in the 
                <emph render="bold">Personal File</emph> series and in the 
                <emph render="bold">Oversize Material</emph> series.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> series contains pictures of Gahagan, as well as images used as part of the OWI's psychological warfare operations. The 
                <emph render="bold">Oversize Material</emph> and 
                <emph render="bold">Printed Matter</emph> series contain further material from the war, including overseas editions of magazines, large propaganda posters, newsmaps, and other government publications. In addition, the 
                <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> series contains various items, such as cigarettes, soap, and fans, created by the OWI as a way of promoting the US and the Allies to other countries during the war. Film related to World War II can be found in the
                <emph render="bold">Motion Picture Films</emph> series.</p>
            <p>In addition, the papers include material related to the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), held in 1945. Gahagan attended this conference as a foreign press liaison officer and helped to organize events for conference delegates with the Bohemian Club of San Francisco. Correspondence, event announcements, publications, and footage of the conference can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">United Nations File</emph>, 
                <emph render="bold">Oversized Material</emph>, and
