            <p>The collection contains the diaries, photographs and associated papers of Henry Hammond (1900-1969), a corporal in the U.S. Army 27th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the “Wolfhounds." The materials cover his enlistment and deployment in the Russian Far East as part of the American Expeditionary Forces in Siberia. (A.E.F.)</p>
            <p>The six handwritten journals offer a rare glimpse into the life of an American soldier stationed in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii and Fort Shafter, Hawaii on to Siberia, the Philippines, and back to the U.S. from 1919 to 1922. Photographs that accompany the diaries often have notes indicating the date, place and subject of the photograph. The collection also includes a lockbox used by Hammond in Siberia, a memoranda book containing notes, rosters and addresses, five photo albums, and a number of loose prints and associated papers, including Hammond’s memorial book from his funeral held on April 15, 1969.</p>
