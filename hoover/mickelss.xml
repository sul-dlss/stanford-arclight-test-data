He moved over from Gotham recording, where he had been effectively producing for RFE while working as a technician for Gotham, because RFE people were from newspapers. He notes that he was involved in radio since high school. When describing the production of the broadcasts, he covers several topics. He describes the RFE offices and studios in New York City. He details how the production needs drove what facilities they used and how they used them; in the process, he describes his effort to get RFE to use cart tapes. The conversation touches on Arkus' direction of plays for radio and other programming meant to catch the ear of the listeners. Arkus details covering three large events: the Olympics; elections, including concurrently interacting with four different services; and a Papal visit to America and live broadcast to Poland. He describes the technical routing of signals. He also speaks about professionalism at RFE and the personal fulfillment he's achieved working at the radios. Arkus joined RFE as a studio recording,  technician in 1950, and was production manager of the New York production center, 1975- . Cassette 2.

Recounting his biography, Bellus explains how he was a member of parliament who eventually escaped Czechoslovakia when the communists came to power.  After escaping to the American embassy in Vienna, Austria, he became involved in Radio Free Europe. He does not go into depth about his escape because the people who helped him escape are still in Czechoslovakia. Instead of immediately going to Munich, he wished to go to America, learn about the country, and become a citizen before working in Germany. The conversation then turns to his work in the Czech-Slovak service. Bellus explains how he came to head the service, and talks about various aspects of his work, for example, the relationship between offices in New York, London, and Munich. Bellus was a defector from the CSSR, 1948; director, RFE Czecho-Slovak service, 1976- . Cassette 4. Use copy reference number: 82074_a_0003437</p></scopecontent>

		<scopecontent><p>Bodin describes many aspects of the news divisions of the radios with a special emphasis on the early 1960s transition of RFE from a political organization with a military background to a journalism organization. The conversation begins with the scope of RFE/RL news division, especially as it relates to the international news organizations. He says that RFE broadcasts as local radio and focuses on local interest. Following, the men discuss the quality and professionalism of the news division. Bodin says non-journalists originally set up the radios to further a political agenda and thus were not professional news organizations. He credits increased travel between east and west by the 1960s in causing the radios to change their scope and organization. The conversation then turns to a lengthy discussion of the content of the news broadcasts. Following, they discuss the bureaus: the function, purpose, and number.  Some time is spent on the relationship between the New York and Munich offices. Other topics discussed include: plagiarism in the New York office; production values of broadcasts; news services RFE subscribed to; Radio Liberty news operation before the merger (Bodin did not know much about it, but didn't like it); Russ Hill and other individual correspondents; and top news stories memos to the various language services. Bodin was successively a member of the news staff, RFE Munich, bureau chief in London, bureau chief in New York, and bureau chief in Washington, D.C. Cassette 9, 10.

When asked, Brown believes the aim of the Radios is to make the public opinion of the countries informed and alert, with an emphasis on alertness. He says the key is to keep the view of Eastern Europeans that RFE is on their side. He calls 1957-62 the most important years of RFE. Cassette 12, 13.

The interview moves to the topic of RL employees' familiarity with the covered nations, which includes the scope of RL's programming--with an emphasis on health news. Mickelson concludes by inquiring about the non-Russian Soviet republics, where RL gets its researchers, and how Bush hopes to expand the research division.
