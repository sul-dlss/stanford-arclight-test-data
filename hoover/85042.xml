                    <p>Matt Lindsay begins the proceedings by describing Britain's National Health Service, arguing that when a health sector is nationalized, resource use is affected in predictable ways. Uwe Reinhardt takes on the German health insurance system by framing it behind the uniquely European principle of solidarity and the ethical principle of maximum tolerable suffering. John Pierce ends the discussion by comparing and contrasting Australia's system with other systems, charting its evolution through the years. Rita Ricardo-Campbell, Michael Zubkoff, and Stewart Spencer respond.</p>
                    <p>After looking at the worldwide experience, the speakers turn their focus towards U.S. policy. Lu Ann Aday talks about her paper, "Health Care in the US: Equitable for Whom?" and Harold Luft responds. Stan Jones then presents on labor's new approach to national health care that attempts to reconcile social welfare goals through private insurance, regulation, and market incentives. Larry Simon ends by talking about his tax credit for catastrophic insurance proposal; Charles Phelps and two other discussants respond. The proceedings end by looking at alternatives to more government. Clark Havighurst talks about the awakening of interest in competition as a way to reign in costs, and Patricia Munch Danzon analyzes reimbursement policies and re-evaluates fee structures. Richard Egdahl, Diana Dutton, and one other discussant respond. Caspar Weinberger closes the conference with a discussion of solutions aimed at stemming rising health care costs.</p>
