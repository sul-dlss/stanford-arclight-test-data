          <unittitle>Central File of Correspondence, Minutes, Administrative Reports, and Records, <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1927-1941 </unitdate>[Series 3]. This series represent the bulk of the files of the MPRC: correspondence, administrative records, minutes, reports (other than research reports), and publicity and fund raising campaign records. Between 1927 and 1935, correspondence was filed separately from the administrative records, minutes, reports, etc. and kept in annual alphabetical files. From the time the central office was reestablished in San Francisco in 1935 until 1941, all records of this series were interfiled in annual alphabetical arrangements. With some modifications, the three subseries of this series represent these original filing patterns</unittitle>

Communications of the central office with directors of MPRC research projects, active MPRC members, legislators, interested persons and organizations, and donors. Includes some supportive or administrative material. Originally this correspondence was kept in annual alphabetical arrangements. However, since many folders of a preceding year had been moved ahead into the next year's file during the years 1927 and 1933, the folders for those years were merged into one alphabetical arrangement. The correspondence for 1934 and 1935 is in its original order</unittitle>
