            <p>The bulk of the collection is rich correspondence to him from friends and fellow officers while in displaced camps in Germany between 1945 and 1951. This is an extraordinary resource for the study of life in DP camps and the experience of forced migration caused by war.</p>
            <p>Also included are Vekshin’s personal papers, such as service records, promotion documents, and other materials, as well as a biographical and genealogical sketch by his daughter Irene Dutikow, and photographs of Vekshin’s children.</p>
            <p>Additional material added in 2017 include albums of press clippings and other matter related to Irene Dutikow (nee Vekshin) and other members of the Dutikow and Vekshin families from 1951 to1991 and undated, photo albums, album sheets and loose prints dating from 1930 to 2015, a framed watercolor of a Russian Orthodox Church, and miscellaneous songbooks produced by the Organizatsiia Rossiiskikh iunykh razvedchikov and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia dated from 1980 to 2008. Apart from family photos, the photographic material depicts Irene Dutikow's work at Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty from 1987 to 2001, the Congress of Russian Americans, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, the Organizatsiia Rossiiskikh iunykh razvedchikov from 1983 to 1997, and her pilgrimages to Orthodox sites in the USA and abroad with Fr. Vsevolod Dutikow from 1989 to 2015.</p>
