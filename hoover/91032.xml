            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The Shirley Mae Stark papers, the bulk of which date from 1967 to 1974, document the experience of American POWs and their families during the Vietnam War through correspondence, newsletters, press releases, clippings, other printed matter, photographs, and memorabilia.</p>
            <p>After her husband was captured in Vietnam, Shirley Stark became involved with various advocacy groups, particularly the National League of Families of American Prisoners in Southeast Asia, that worked to raise awareness of the plight of missing and captured American soldiers. As a member of these groups, she received correspondence and newsletters providing information about efforts on behalf of POWs/MIAs, which can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> series, under 
                <emph render="bold">POW/MIA advocacy groups</emph>. She also participated in fundraising activities, which included the sale of rubber stamps, bumper stickers, and bracelets. Examples of some of these items can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> series.</p>
            <p>Of particular note are the bracelets, each of which featured the name and date of capture of a POW. Individuals who purchased the bracelets could opt to receive further information about the POW and his family, and many went on to correspond with family members and the returned POWs. William Stark’s name was on one of the bracelets, and as a result, there is a large amount of correspondence from members of the public, particularly after his release, inquiring about his well-being and welcoming him home. This can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> series, under 
                <emph render="bold">General</emph>, particularly in the folders for 1973.</p>
            <p>Shirley Stark also received regular updates from the Department of the Navy relating to her husband’s pay and benefits, instructions for sending mail and packages to Vietnam, and the POW situation generally. These letters, many of which included informational attachments, can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> series, under 
                <emph render="bold">Department of the Navy</emph>. Other Navy and POW-related publications can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Printed Matter</emph> series, which also contains clippings collected by Shirley Stark about the experiences of the POWs and their families, the work of the government and advocacy groups, and the return of the POWs to the United States. Some of these articles are specifically about the Stark family. Additional clippings, as well as some correspondence, photographs, and printed matter, can be found in the albums created by Shirley and Gladys Stark in the 
                <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> series.</p>
