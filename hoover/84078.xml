            <p>Ronald Reagan described 
                <emph render="italic">The Governor and the Students</emph> this way:</p>
            <p>"During my last two years in office we had a program in cooperation with the department of education. Each week a different high school class would come to the Capitol and I would field their questions (or try to) for one hour. The program was entirely unrehearsed. I would meet them only a few minutes before we actually started and, of course, had no preview of their questions.</p>
            <p>"The hour was taped for television and made available for closed circuit classroom use in all of California's 1100-plus school districts. It was also played on the educational TV network." [Box 1; original source unidentified]</p>
            <p>The program gave Reagan a way to connect with young people. Modeled on the press conference format, the idea for the show originated with Reagan aides Michael K. Deaver and Joseph R. Holmes. High school students were chosen over college students on the theory that they lived with their parents, had not been exposed to liberal college professors, and would therefore be more polite and less radical.</p>
            <p>The shows were taped on a weekday after school, and the videotapes were distributed to TV stations in California to air at no cost. While most were public broadcast stations, it aired on a commercial station in Visalia because there was no public broadcast station in that area. The series was produced by JRH and Associates in Sacramento. The name Young People's Television (YPTV) is also associated with this program.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>This collection consists of videotapes and selected transcripts of broadcasts of a televised series of question-and-answer sessions with high school students conducted by Ronald Reagan as governor of California, relating to California state political issues.</p>
            <p>Transcripts are available for ten programs, and lists of questions asked by the students are available for another ten shows.</p>
            <p>Labels on the videotapes provide limited information about their contents. Fully identifying each tape by date and version is dependent on, and limited by, its label. Some tapes are labeled as opening and closing credits sequences. Based on the videotape labels, it appears that the programs are about 30 minutes in duration.</p>

                            <p>Members of Modesto City Schools' Inter-High Student Council ask Governor Ronald Reagan questions in the room where Reagan holds press conferences.</p>
                            <p>Sequence: This program has no clear-cut beginning and end. Content begins with Reagan's voice chatting off-air (00:26), visuals begin with view of students (00:35), and Reagan begins formal remarks (00:45) followed by a superimposed program title (00:50). First question, on capital punishment (02:20), last question, about abortion, is partially lost due to dropout (29:18), but picks up again (29:31). Reagan indicates program is over (30:35), but takes another question, but footage ends abruptly before he replies.</p>
                            <p>There are 30 seconds of color bars at beginning, then audio comes in before video. Color shift, jumpy images, and dropout due to deterioration of original tape. Image and sound dropout from 00:29:18 - 00:29:32. Additional Title: Inter-High Student Council, 29 January 1973.</p>

                            <p>Freshman and sophomores from the College of Marin ask Governor Ronald Reagan questions in press conference format.</p>
                            <p>Sequence: PART 1: Slate (00:47), opening sequence with sound preceding image (01:01), Reagan introduces program (01:25), student corrects Reagan's mistake in name of college and then asks first question, about how much control the state should have over education, especially at community colleges (02:12), closing credits (27:31). PART 2: Slate (29:48), opening sequence (30:07), program begins as student is asking question about California state government's investments in South Africa (30:20), closing credits (59:06).</p>
                            <p>Color shift, jumpy images, and dropout due to deterioration of original tape. The dates of these programs are somewhat uncertain. The slate for the first indicates the date as 6/11, while the slate for the second indicates the date as 1-2-74. The second program on this tape appears to be the same content as that on tape 38, though the format of the opening sequence and closing credits differ.</p>

                            <p>This program features a group of honorary scholastic students at Jesuit High School in Sacramento. It was taped on location in one of the studios of Channel 10. A public safety announcement (PSA) about seat belts precedes the main program. Governor Reagan drives up to a sheriff who is standing along the road and talks to him through the car window. The sheriff thanks Reagan for wearing his seat belt. Reagan tells the sheriff how seat belts save lives, then turns to the camera and says, "Why don't you belt yourself." The sheriff turns to the camera and suggests that you "belt your wife or girlfriend--keep her alive too."</p>
                            <p>Sequence: seat belt PSA (00:23), opening title sequence (01:18), Reagan begins speaking (01:40), first question, about public aid to private schools (02:15), closing sequence (28:18).</p>
                            <p>Labels on the tape indicated that this tape concerned the College of Marin, 19 December 1973. While there is no introductory slate, Reagan's introduction details it to be Jesuit High. There is no confirmation of the date on the label.</p>

                            <p>This program features an unidentified group of students. It appears to have been taped in the studio at the state capitol. Tape labelling indicates this as College of Marin, but the introductory slate indicates only that it is the Governor and Students 6/11 number 14. Because the program cuts off some amount of the beginning, Reagan's introduction, during which he identifies the students to the audience, is missing. While the tape label lists the date as 9 January 1974, the slate suggests it is June 11.</p>
                            <p>Sequence: introductory slate (00:33), McGraw-Hill Pacific Productions slate (01:27), opening title sequence (01:38), program begins in the middle of a student asking Reagan a question (01:58), closing sequence (30:31).</p>

                            <p>Four men convicted of car theft in California are interviewed about their experiences stealing cars--how and why they did it, how they got caught, what prison is like, being on parole, as well as characteristics of various makes and models of cars. Their names are not known; it appears that they are introduced in the first few minutes of the program, during which there is no sound. This tape is part of the Governor and the Students video collection, but does not fit with that television series.</p>
