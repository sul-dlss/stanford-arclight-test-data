            <p>Charlotte Ellen Martin was born in Fennville River, Illinois, May 1904. At age six, she moved to the Cebu Island in the Philippines where her father Bob worked as a businessman. Martin came back to the Philippines after high school and met Cecil John Martin whom she later married. C. J. Martin was a businessman and master seaman who founded and owned The Cebu Stevedoring Company where he navigated through the straits of Cebu and surrounding islands.</p>
            <p>At the outbreak of World War II, Charlotte Martin signed up for duty first working for United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) in the Office of the Surgeon Force. Then, she was heavily involved in the Red Cross and later, worked for the Army's Office of Strategic Service, (O.S.S.) in Washington, D.C. providing U.S. Army forces with intelligence in the field in order for OSS to help train anti-Japanese guerrilla movement in the Philippines--because she knew the culture and spoke the language fluently. Evidence of her second language is demonstrated in letters to the presidents of The Philippine Commonwealth, Sergio Osmeña, Jr. and Manual Acuña Roxas.</p>
            <p>By 1942, The Japanese Imperial Army had occupied many strategic areas of the archipelago. Charlotte Martin went into hiding on the advice of a military friend. Many Filipino, Spanish and Americans hid from Japanese Imperial Forces in fear of experiencing the atrocities that were widely reported. Martin hid in the hills and mountains of Cebu, Leyte and Mindanao avoiding the Japanese until November 1943 when she was rescued by submarine and taken to Australia ending her ordeal.</p>
            <p>This experience became the basis of her book that she wanted published entitled “Two Jumps Ahead of the Japs” which was subsequently censored and reviewed by the War Department and then rejected by major publishers because of the sensitive nature of the information in the book. Nevertheless, Martin's story is a first person account of how she survived in hiding from enemy forces.</p>
            <p>After World War II, Martin became friends with President Sergio Osmeña (born in Cebu City) and was invited to attend his daughter's wedding in New York. When she came back to the Philippines from Washington, DC, she embedded herself into the threadwork of Filipino life once again. Martin was a board member of the Women's Club, the Girl Scouts and the Cebu City Rotary Club. Much later, C. John Martin sold The Cebu Stevedoring Company in October 1968.</p>
            <p>In 1969, Cebu City adopted C. John Martin and Charlotte Ellen Martin as official "son" and "daughter" of their city as a gesture of gratitude for helping the community during and after the Philippine invasion. When her husband passed away in 1971, Charlotte sold their estate in Cebu. She remained a citizen of the United States enabling her to travel and to receive benefits she rightfully deserved but at painstaking cost. As the sale of her husband's company closed, Ms. Martin moved to San Francisco, California.</p>

                    <p>Martin wrote a draft and manuscript entitled, “Two jumps ahead of the Japs: A story of an American woman’s experiences in occupied territory,” from about 1944 to 1945. Manuscripts of this text range up to 232 pages including word counts. “Two Jumps Ahead of the Japs” is her first person account of her survival in enemy occupied territory in the Philippines during World War II. Martin also tells of things she heard through military friends who help her hide. Includes correspondence about the manuscript and the radio broadcast that took place on March 23, 1945 in San Francisco, California.</p>
