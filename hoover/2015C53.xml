            <p>Zygmunt Iwanowski (Sigismund de Ivanowski) was a Polish artist resident in the United States and military aide to Ignace Paderewski from 1918-1920.</p>
            <p>Zygmunt Iwanowski (Sigismund de Ivanowski) born in Odessa, April 17, 1874, died in Westmoreland, Cheshire, New Hampshire, April 12, 1944</p>
            <p>Parents: Feliks Iwanowski (born in Paris, died in 1925, Nieszawa) and Amelia Witanowska (died in 1929, Warsaw)</p>
            <p>Sister: Zofia Ossendowska (born in 1887, Sieradz, died in 1943, Warsaw) married in 1923 to Antoni Ferdynand Ossendowski (1878-1945); and more siblings</p>
            <p>Wife: Helen, born February 2, 1882 in Jacksonville, Florida, daughter of John Moser (born in Germany) and Matilda Gordon (born in Canada). Zygmunt and Helen were married in London on February 8, 1900. Helen lost her parents early; her guardian was the artist Frederick Charles Gordon (1856-1924), probably a relative of her mother, Matilda Gordon. The association evolved into a brief marriage, which ended in divorce in November 1899. This seemed to have no bearing on the very cordial relationship, which both Helen and Zygmunt had with their Westfield, N.J. neighbor, Gordon. Helen died June 8, 1943 in Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey. Daughter: Irena (Irenka), born 1901, Poland, married Robert C. Perry, born 1884; married in New York City, 1924; both likely died in 1979 in New Hampshire.</p>
            <p>Grandchildren: Anna E. (Anne) Perry, born 1928, New Jersey and David S. Perry, born 1930, New Jersey, died 2000, Wuhan, China</p>
