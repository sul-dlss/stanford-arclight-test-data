            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>George Zechanowitsch, a Russian émigré in Poland, Austria, and subsequently Canada, was born in Petrograd in 1918 into a Polish-Russian family. His father, Peter Stanislaus Ciechanowicz, served in the Imperial Russian army and then General Pilsudki's forces. He owned an estate in Piaski, near Lublin, and died in Auschwitz in 1941 without ever having met his only son.</p>
            <p>His mother, Olga Sawicki/Savitzky, was born to a Russified Polish father, Aleksei Iakovlevich Savitskii, who has an Imperial military service record included in this collection covering the years 1885-1902. Her mother, Anna Sawicki (born Geysler/Hausler), was of Baltic German origins and the daughter of Egor Geisler, who has an Imperial service record included in this collection covering the years 1856-1869.</p>
            <p>George grew up in inter-war Vilnius, his maternal grandmother’s family home, attending a Russian school there after which he attended the Polish university in Vilnius before World War II. He was raised largely by his maternal grandmother and the two of them were able to resettle in Austria after the Molotov-Ribentropp pact. His grandmother lived in Linz while George was able to continue his studies in Vienna and Graz before ending up in a DP camp on the American side of the Danube in Linz after the war. He emigrated to Canada in 1948.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The papers of George Zechanowitsch include identification, school, military, and legal documents, as well as photographs, relating to Russian émigré life in Vilnius in the inter-war years, Austria during the war, and to displaced persons following World War II. Also included are photographs, identification, military or Russian Imperial government service records, Russian Orthodox birth and death records and property documents of other family members. The collection reflects the legal circumstances of an upper class man, of multi-ethnic heritage, coming of age in shifting geopolitical circumstances.</p>
            <p>In addition to the materials documenting George Zechanowitsch's (Georgii Stanislavovich TSekhanovich, Георгий Станиславович Цеханович, Georgij Ciechanowicz, Jurgis Ciechanovic) life in Petrograd, Vilnius and Austria in the first half of the 20th century, there are materials of his ancestors, mostly related to Russia and inter-war Vilnius. These are largely from his maternal grandmother, Anna Savitskaia (Анна Савицкая, Anna Sawicka, Ona Savickiene), née Geisler (Гейслер, Geysler, Häusler) and her family. There are a few documents relating to his mother, Olga Alekseevna Savitskaia (Ольга Алексеевна Савицкая), and father, Peter Stanislaus Ciechanowicz (Petr Stanislav Adolfovich Tsekhanovich, Петр Станислав Адольфович Цеханович).</p>
            <p>The names appearing in the other family documents and photographs include: Egor Geisler (Eгор Гейслер), Aleksei Iakovlevich Savitskii (Алексей Яковлевич Савицкий), Mikhail Georgievich Geisler (Михаил Георгиевич Гейслер), Vladimir Savitskii (Владимир Савицкий), Zinaida Savitskaia (Зинаида Савицкая), and Boris Bliss.</p>
            <p>The exact connection of each family member to George Zechanowitsch can be found in a 24-page biography, located in the first folder, which was written by his wife, Aimi Zechanowitsch. Her order of, and titles for, the materials have been maintained for the most part.</p>
