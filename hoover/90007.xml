            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The Miller Upton papers include writings, correspondence, memoranda, minutes, conference material, reports, printed matter, and miscellany related to American participation in international cooperative activities, especially in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); international education; the Federal Union; and economics. Although the collection has not been arranged, the index to major groups can serve as a guide to the materials.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Miller Upton held a variety of roles related to the field of education, including professor, college president, and delegate to UNESCO. He was interested in working with international organizations to achieve education goals. The collection includes 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> dating from 1962 to 1975, during which time he served as president of Beloit College and a delegate to UNESCO. His 
                <emph render="bold">Speeches and Writings</emph> contain articles related to economics, as well as commencement addresses.</p>
            <p>From 1960 to 1961, Upton served as chairman of Governor Gaylord A. Nelson's "Blue Ribbon Tax Committee," which revamped Wisconsin's tax structure. The 
                <emph render="bold">Continuing Revenue Survey Commission File</emph> includes commission reports, meeting minutes, and correspondence related to this project.</p>
            <p>In May 1970, Upton wrote an open letter to President Nixon regarding the Kent State shootings. Although Upton opposed the Vietnam War, a point that he affirmed in the letter, he apologized for the "grotesque failure of the academic community at this hour of national trial and turmoil," and wrote, "If the fault lies anywhere for the Kent State deaths it lies not with you and the Vietnam War but with the radical acts and excesses we have tolerated in the name of dissent." The letter was originally published in a student newspaper, but went on to receive national attention. The 
                <emph render="bold">Richard M. Nixon File</emph> includes Upton's open letter, clippings, and responses.</p>
            <p>From 1970 to 1974, Upton was a United States delegate to UNESCO. During that time, he also served as the chairman to the United States National Commission for UNESCO, a group that functioned as a Federal Advisory Committee to the Department of State. In 1974, Upton was the chairman of the United States delegation to the 18th General Conference. The 
                <emph render="bold">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) File</emph> includes correspondence, conference materials, reports, and speeches documenting Upton's involvement with UNESCO.</p>
            <p>From 1975 to 1976, Upton served as a consultant to a special committee of the Association of American Colleges to determine the future role of the Association. The 
                <emph render="bold">Association of American Colleges File</emph> includes meeting materials, correspondence, memoranda, and notes documenting Upton's work for the organization.</p>
            <p>From 1976 to 1980, Upton served as CEO and chairman of the Federal Union, a British organization, formed in 1939 and incorporated in 1940, advocating a federal union of Europe as a post-war aim to defend against totalitarianism. The organization was committed to furthering ideas proposed in the book 
                <title render="italic">Union Now</title> by Clarence K. Streit. The 
                <emph render="bold">Federal Union File</emph> includes correspondence, memoranda, printed matter (including issues of 
                <emph render="italic">Freedom &amp; Union</emph>), meeting minutes, and clippings.</p>
            <p>In a note concerning his philosophy of life, Upton wrote, "Should someone ever want to give me a tag, let it be 'a conservative for liberal reasons'" (Box 7, Folder 11). Upton was a pacifist and conscientious objector during WWII, and wrote, "I am and have been throughout my adult life passionately opposed to war. It is the ultimate human folly. It is man's power of reason perverted to the extreme. It is the antithesis of the essence of Christ's teachings." ("Federal Union—A Practical Means to Peace," Box 12, Folder 6).</p>
