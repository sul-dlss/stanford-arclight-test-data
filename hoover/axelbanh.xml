        <p>The Hoover Institution acquired the Herman Axelbank motion picture film collection in 1979 from
the family of the late Herman Axelbank. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Alexander Kulakoff,
who is a general partner of the Harrington-Kulakoff Development Company, Palo Alto,
California, donated funds to describe, index, and produce preservation and use copies
of the first 28 reels of the collection. Without his financial assistance, the Herman
Axelbank collection could not now be made available for research by the scholarly community. I am pleased to acknowledge his generous support and interest.</p>

      <head>Background</head>
      <p>Herman Axelbank (1900-1979) devoted his energies for over fifty years to compiling a motion picture film chronicle of the last years of Imperial Russia, the Russian revolutions, and the new government which emerged from the upheaval. He was born in the village of Novo-Konstantinov, in the Russian Empire, on May 30, 1900; his family moved to New York in 1909. Fascinated with film-making from childhood, Axelbank got a job, in 1916, as an office boy for Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn) at Goldwyn Pictures on Forty-second Street. The news of the February Revolution in Russia captured the young Axelbank's imagination. "Wish I could take moving pictures over there; we don't have any of our own [American Revolution] in 1775," he remembered remarking to a co-worker.</p>
      <p>At about that time Axelbank met a cameraman whose assignments took him to Eastern Europe. Axelbank commissioned him to film Lenin and Trotsky, pawning his possessions and borrowing from friends in order to pay the cameraman's advance. In 1922 the cameraman returned with film of such events as the Kronstadt Mutiny of March 1921 and the Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries of 1922. With such a beginning, Axelbank's film archive was already noteworthy; in the 1920's the Pathe, International, and Fox news services, and even the Soviet government, purchased film from him.</p>
      <p>Axelbank soon acquired film taken on the German, Austrian, and Turkish fronts during World War I, film of the Tsar and his family, and of scenes from pre-revolutionary Russia, including provincial towns as well as Moscow and St. Petersburg. In most instances the names of the cameramen and other circumstances surrounding the filming have not been preserved. Surviving bills of sale from the 1920's show that Jawitz Pictures Corporation sold Axelbank film footage of the Provisional Government (cameramen: Darovsky, Himmel, Rizhok, Borisof, Slonim, and Dzhakel), Petrograd and Moscow during the Russian Revolution (cameraman: Thompson), and the Lenin funeral; Noxall Film Company sold him footage on Tsarist Russia, Denikin, and Kolchak (cameramen: Risemann, Kubelik, and Hoffman); and Robitschek, Ehrlich and Company sold him footage of the city of Moscow. Other records were destroyed in a 1959 fire at the facility where Axelbank stored his flammable nitrate film. Many other acquisitions of the 1930's through the 1950's were accomplished by means of verbal agreements.</p>
      <p>In 1918 Axelbank attended a lecture by John Reed and later did some filming for the Friends of Soviet Russia, but he never became deeply involved in politics. His primary interest remained his historical film project.</p>
      <p>In 1921 Axelbank assisted the Friends of Soviet Russia in making the film "Russia Through the Shadows," which was shown to raise funds for Soviet famine relief. In 1922 he made the three-reel documentary "With the Movie Camera Through the Bolshevik Revolution" using the footage he had already collected. Meanwhile, he continued collecting more film from cameramen and emigres, sometimes making trips to Europe and concluding the deals at some risk to himself. In 1924 he made "The Truth About Russia." He regarded these feature films as the means to raise money for his collecting efforts and as the groundwork for his film "Tsar to Lenin."</p>
      <p>In December 1928 Axelbank contacted Max Eastman, who had published "Lenin's Testament" in the West, and asked for his assistance in the editing and narration of "Tsar to Lenin." The project took about one year. (One of the narrators whose voice appears in the early reels of the Herman Axelbank Film Collection is Eastman.) During this period Eastman went to Prinkipo Island to film Trotsky and his family in exile there. "Tsar to Lenin" premiered at the Filmarte Theater in New York on March 6, 1937. Its presentation of the role of Trotsky and the Old Bolsheviks in the Revolution aroused the ire of American Communists loyal to Stalin's line. They picketed the theaters in which the film was shown.</p>
      <p>Through the years Axelbank attributed events such as his being followed, thefts of film, and the 1959 fire in the facility where his film was stored to continuing Soviet displeasure with his film collecting efforts. Ironically, in the 1960's and early 1970's representatives of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism showed interest in buying the early reels of Axelbank's film collection. In all probability they were interested in filling in gaps in their own film records of Trotsky and other revolutionaries whom Stalin had eliminated from the Soviet film archives as well as from life.</p>

      <head>Scope of the Collection</head>
      <p>The Herman Axelbank Film Collection consists of 266 reels containing over 250,000 feet of film, primarily newsreel and documentary footage. The editing of the film and its chronological arrangement are the work of Axelbank. As attested by the desire of the Soviet representatives to purchase the first forty-four reels of the collection, the footage on these reels, taken during the period from about 1901 to 1937, is extremely rare; some portions are unique. Included are the Tsar, his family, and associates in moments of relaxation as well as at official ceremonies; the Russian revolutions of 1917; the Civil War, with especially good coverage of Siberia and the Far East; and revolutionary and governmental leaders of the Tsarist, Provisional Government, and Soviet periods. There is also extensive coverage of World War II. Ceremonial events, such as May Day and October Revolution anniversaries and funerals of prominent figures, including Tolstoy and Lenin, are well represented. Coverage extends into the 1970's. Some Soviet feature films, such as "Kombrig Ivanov," made in 1923, are also included. According to Dr. Raymond Fielding, a leading film expert, the Axelbank Collection is "undoubtedly the largest and most valuable film collection devoted to the subject of revolutionary and pre-revolutionary Russia in the Western hemisphere, and probably in the Western world."</p>

      <head>How to Use the Guide</head>
      <p>The original film held by the Hoover Institution Archives is on 35 mm positive stock; Axelbank had the earlier reels converted from nitrate to acetate-base (safety) stock.</p>
      <p>To facilitate description of the contents of the film, each reel is divided into segments, and the segments into feet.</p>
      <p>The type of film is described according to the following alphabetic code.</p>
      <list type="ordered">
        <item>Actuality: incorporating two classes of "real life" film
<list type="ordered"><item>"Live" film of an event either totally unplanned or at least planned primarily for purposes other than film-making</item><item>Factual material - demonstrations of equipment, interviews, speeches, comment - specially filmed for inclusion in instructional films, news reports, etc.</item></list></item>
        <item>Dramatisation: film retaining an essentially documentary approach to its subject without meeting either of the "Actuality" definitions</item>
        <item>Fiction</item>
        <item>Illustrative material: maps, graphs, diagrams, reproductions of photographs and illustrations from books</item>

            <emph render="bold">PURPOSE OF THE FILM</emph>
          </p>
          <p>To depict the events during the years 1914-1920 when the Bolsheviks seized control of the Russian government and fought to maintain themselves in power until Vladimir Lenin had replaced the Czar as the head of that government.</p>
          <p>
            <emph render="bold">CONTENT OF THE FILM</emph>
          </p>
          <p>The film tells the story of the Russian Revolution from its outbreak in February of 1917 to November 1920 when the last of the counter-revolutionary forces were defeated. Rare pictures of the fighting and of the personalities involved are used.</p>
          <p>The film story begins with scenes of Czar Nicholas I1 and his family just before the outbreak of World War I. The character of the Czar is brought out and the frivolous ways in which he and his family amused themselves while the country seethed with discontent are shown.</p>
          <p>As a result of the disaster suffered by the army and the hardships endured by the populace, discontent flared into the open. Trouble first began in the streets at Petrograd where crowds gathered to sing revolutionary songs and display banners demanding <title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">Peace, Bread, and Liberty!</title> Although the Czar ordered the soldiers to disperse the mobs, the soldiers refused and actually joined the people. A workers' council called a <title linktype="simple" render="doublequote">soviet</title> was formed in Petrograd. Four of the Czar's regiments mutinied and placed themselves at the disposal of the revolutionists. Although the Czar sent other troops from the front, they too joined the revolt. The Czar was forced to abdicate.</p>
          <p>The film then shows the events of the early stages of the Revolution: how the Grand Duke Michael Romanov refused the throne, how a government was organized under Prince Lwow and then, later, under Alexander Kerensky. The film also shows the gathering forces that opposed each other under the moderate government of Prince Lwow and Kerensky. It shows the arrival of Lenin and the struggle for power that took place which resulted in Lenin's seizure of the reins of government.</p>
          <p>Scenes showing how Lenin, with the aid of Trotsky, maintained himself and the Bolsheviks in power, and how the war with Germany ended, at Lenin's insistence, on most unfavorable terms, are presented. The treaty of Brest-Litovsk, however, did not bring peace to Russia, for now most of the world was against her. Former allies were dismayed at her withdrawal from the war and shocked at the character of the Bolshevik government. Allied troops landed at Archangel and at Vladivostok. Czecho-slovak war prisoners seized the Trans-Siberian railroad. Within a year fourteen hostile counter-revolutionary armies were fighting against the Soviets.</p>
          <p>For the next three years Russia was subjected to a violent civil war. Ruthless terror and killing became common practice on both sides. The Czar and all his family were shot to death, their bodies burned, and the ashes scattered in a swamp. Lenin himself was wounded by an assassin.</p>
          <p>Of the counter-revolutionary armies the most important were led by General Denikin in the south, Admiral Kolchak in the east, General Bogayevsky in the southwest, and General Yudenich in the northwest. But Trotsky had done his work well; the Red Army defeated each in turn until finally, in mid-November of 1920, the last of General Denikin's troops fled from the Crimea to end the civil war. In the meanwhile, the Allies had tired of the occupation and had withdrawn their troops.</p>
          <p>The infant Soviet Republic with Lenin at the helm had survived. Lenin and the Bolsheviks (now called Communists) could turn their attention to rebuilding the shattered nation.</p>

          </p>
          <p>1. Why are major wars often breeders of revolutionary movements within the nations which participate in them?</p>
          <p>2. Often revolutions which start as moderate movements result in radical developments of either the right or left. Why is this so?</p>
          <p>3. Why is it often possible for a small, well-organized minority to seize control of a nation?</p>
          <p>4. Marx had predicted that Communist revolutions would take place first in the highly industrialized nations. Yet the first successful Communist seizure of power took place in Russia, a relatively backward agrarian nation. Why?</p>

          <p>5. Why did Russia's former war allies intervene and then lose interest?</p>
          <p>6. What were Lenin's objectives for world wide communism?</p>
          <p>7. After the war with Germany was ended, what opposition did Lenin and the Bolsheviks face at home? How was this opposition overcome?</p>
