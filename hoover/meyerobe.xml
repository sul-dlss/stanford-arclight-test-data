				  <unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1944 </unitdate>by Anna Maria Borgia, a sixteen-year-old Roman art student. They were part of a project an American soldier suggested to Miss Borgia and her mother when he became acquainted with them through an Italian friend who was concerned about their dire economic plight. Mrs Borgia's husband and Anna Maria's father was a prisoner of war. The couple's other children were Marco and Germana, who were then age twelve and age six respectively. When the GI learned that the Borgias had no income, and that Anna Maria was a competent illustrator, he asked her to design some inexpensive authentic Italian souvenirs which might be sold at the Post Exchange operated by the United States Army. The Borgias liked the idea very much and began their own "casa" industry in earnest soon after the American started providing them with varicolored cardboard, paper and string discarded by fellow soldiers in his unit. PX officials welcomed the low-priced handmade mementos, displayed them at the store in Rome, then turned over to Miss Borgia all the money received. One day while browsing in a Roman flea market the American soldier saw an antique belt made of metal disks linked with flexible rings. That inspired him to design a contemporary female fashion accessory: a belt made of decorated lightweight wood and cord. He used wooden rectangles 1&#xBD;" x 2" and twine. Anna Maria Borgia drew people or places on paper, then pasted them to the tiny panels that Marco had cut from scraps of plywood contributed by officers of a nearby U.S. Army glider base. Mrs. Borgia and Germana sorted and braided the string with which they joined half-a-dozen miniature paintings to form the belts. To emphasize the Italian origin of the souvenirs Anna Maria Borgia usually worked with red and green paint on white paper, and selected red and green cord for connections; but some belts were limited to single hues to complement the wearer's costume. The belts wee sold at the PX for 500 lire ($5)</unittitle>
