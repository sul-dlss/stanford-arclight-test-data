      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The 50th anniversary of the June 1941 deportations of Latvians into the Soviet gulag was commemorated with an international conference of historians in Riga in June 2001. Scholars from the Baltic states, Sweden, Moldova, Israel, and the United States presented papers on the topic of Stalin-era deportations in Latvia, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and also on the fate of Jews under the Nazi occupation, which also occurred in June 1941, some three weeks after the Soviet deportations.</p>
      <p>Many of the conference papers situate the Latvian deportations within a broader context of Soviet repressive structures. Studies were presented on issues of collaboration within occupied states, on the international response to the Soviet measures against Latvians, and on the question of rehabilitating or otherwise compensating victims of Soviet-era human rights violations.</p>
      <p>Several of the Riga conference papers also make a comparison between Soviet and Nazi occupation regimes, through a study of propaganda campaigns waged by both totalitarian powers. Among the images used to illustrate this comparison were posters from the collection of the Hoover Institution Archives. Of particular interest were Nazi propaganda posters, often of a crudely anti-Semitic nature, which were issued in the wake of Operation Barbarossa--the German invasion of the Soviet Union, including Soviet-annexed Latvia--and which depicted or referred to Soviet atrocities in a way which was meant to indict "Jewish Bolshevism" for these acts. </p>
      <p>The collection of conference materials in the Hoover Institution Archives includes: abstracts of papers; news articles concerning the conference and other activities related to the anniversary of the Soviet deportations; and brochures from exhibits on this topic in Riga museums. A CD-ROM of Soviet and Nazi propaganda imagery which was used as the basis of one of the conference papers is also available.</p>
