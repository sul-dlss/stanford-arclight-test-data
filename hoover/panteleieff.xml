            <p>M. P. Panteleieff was a baritone who had a successful career in Russia and the United States. Born in 1887, he began his operatic career in the Musical Drama Theater of St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1914, where he played the part of Valentine in Gounaud's version of"Faust." In 1918, he left Russia to tour the Far East, eventually gravitating to the west coast of the United States. Early in the 1920s he founded the Russian Grand Opera Company, which gave performances across the U.S.</p>
            <p>Panteleieff himself appeared as Boris Godunov in the opera of the same name, as the demon in Anton Rubenstein's composition based on Lermontov's poem, as King Dodon in Rimsky-Korsakoff's "Le Coq d'Or," and in many other roles. Critics consistently extolled his performances and some even compared him to Fedor Shaliapin. After many years of touring with Russian opera companies, he died in the United States in 1958.</p>
