            <p>Mary Catherine Roberts was a nurse with the Siberian Commission of the American Red Cross in 1919-1920. She spent several months in Vladivostok and Irkutsk, where the Red Cross gave relief to Russian refugees. This collection contains clippings about the activities of the American Red Cross in Siberia, the evacuation of Russian children from Vladivostok to Petrograd in 1920-1921, the execution of the Czar's family, and several issues of 
                <emph render="italic">The Siberian See-Chas</emph>, a bulletin for the Members of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia.</p>
            <p>Detailed processing and preservation microfilming for these materials were made possible by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and by matching funds from the Hoover Institution and Museum of Russian Culture. The grant also provides depositing a microfilm copy in the Hoover Institution Archives. The original materials remain in the Museum of Russian Culture, San Francisco as its property. A transfer table indicating corresponding box and reel numbers is available at the Hoover Institution Archives.</p>
