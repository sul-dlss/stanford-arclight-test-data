            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Mieczys&#322;aw Rakowski (1926-2008), a journalist and politician, was Poland's top communist intellectual. 
                From 1958 to 1982, he was the editor-in-chief of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) organ <title render="italic">Polityka,</title> perhaps the most open 
                and sophisticated weekly in all the Soviet Bloc. He was deputy prime minister from 1981 to 1985, and the vice-marshal of Sejm from 1985 to 1988. 
                Rakowski was prime minister from 1988 to 1989, the last year of the communist regime in Poland before the takeover of the government by the Solidarity opposition. 
                After the PUWP suffered a resounding defeat in the first semi-free elections in the Soviet bloc in June 1989, Rakowski tried, unsuccessfully, to salvage the future 
                of his party, becoming its last first secretary. During the remaining eighteen years of his life, he tried to present himself as a Social Democrat
                and continued to write and offer occasional political commentary on Polish politics. 
                He visited the Hoover Institution in 1998 and gave a lecture on Poland and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc titled, 
                "Ushering Out Communism: A View from the Other Side."</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The materials include some thirty-eight years of political diaries, writings, printed matter, photographs, and sound and video recordings. 
                Of particular importance are Rakowski's diaries, including the original texts, showing redactions and revisions made before their subsequent partial 
                publication in 1998 to 1999. The diaries, covering the period from 1958 through 1996, are an invaluable source on Polish and former Soviet Bloc politics 
                as seen by an astute observer and participant. Comparing the originals with the published version provides an interesting record of the author's intellectual 
                and political meanderings and evolution and, for students of the ancillary disciplines of history, an excellent case study of how diaries are turned into memoirs.</p>
