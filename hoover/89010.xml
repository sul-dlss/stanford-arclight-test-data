<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Howard A. Reed papers document the development of international education programs, in particular Middle East and Turkish studies, at the University of Connecticut at Storrs and across the United States.  In addition the papers reflect Reed's work with the American Friends Service Committee in promoting the research of peace through international exchange programs for students, as well as his work as a consultant to ministers of National Education in Turkey.  The papers consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports, studies, notes, curricular material, conference papers and proceedings, meeting minutes, photographs, printed matter, and sound recordings.</p>
<p>The <emph render="bold">University of Connecticut file</emph> contains materials relating to the administrative and educational activities of the History Department of the University of Connecticut at Storrs, where Howard Reed was a professor of Islamic, Middle East, and Ottoman history and director of the Institute of International and Intercultural Studies.  In 1978 Reed was awarded a $57,000 three-year federal grant to coordinate a statewide international studies program for undergraduates.  As director of the Undergraduate International Studies Program (UISP) Reed was responsible for coordinating a mobile outreach program to community colleges, structuring the curriculum, inviting guest speakers and lecturers, and promoting exchange programs with universities in other countries.  The materials relating to this program can be found in the <emph render="bold">University of Connecticut file</emph> as well as the <emph render="bold">Subject file</emph> and are in the form of grant applications, financial records, flyers, promotional materials, correspondence with participating state colleges and universities, newspaper clippings, and other printed matter.</p>
<p>The <emph render="bold">Subject file</emph> covers a wide variety of topics related to education and the Middle East. Brochures, correspondence, newsletters, and other materials by Friends World College, a college based on Quaker principles and the promotion of peace and international studies, are found in this series. </p>
<p>Reed co-founded the <emph render="bold">Middle East Studies Association</emph> and Turkish Studies Association in North America. The Middle East Studies Association file includes correspondence about the first MESA conference in 1967 and conference materials from subsequent meetings. </p>
<p>Materials relating to <emph render="bold">Turkish Studies</emph> are in the collection in the form of Turkish newspapers, journals, conference papers and proceedings, and course materials.  Much of Reed's writings and research on Turkey, its history and education system, can be found in this series as well as in the <emph render="bold">National Education of Turkey consultant file</emph>, which includes mostly printed materials collected during Reed's time as a consultant to the Turkish minister of national education. </p>
<p>As the grandson of International College founder, Alexander MacLachlan, and son of one of its early presidents Cass Arthur Reed, Reed's interest in international education was shaped by International College. The papers include research material about the <emph render="bold">International College</emph> of Izmir, which was later relocated to Beirut, Lebanon.  Highlights from these materials include copies of minutes from meetings of Board of Trustees from the early years of the college and photographs of students from 1914 to 1920.  </p>
