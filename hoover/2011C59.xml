<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Dr. Klaus Kirchner, a collector of propaganda, is based in Erlangen, Germany. Kirchner created a comprehensively illustrated set of reference books on World War II leaflets, flyers, pamphlets, and broadsides which was published from 1972 to 2009.</p>
</bioghist>
<scopecontent id="a3" encodinganalog="520">
<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The material in this collection is from Klaus Kirchner's "Soviet Central Series." It consists of World War II Soviet propaganda broadsides, leaflets, and flyers aimed at German troops and the German population. Kirchner wrote the following as an explanatory note for the collection: "The Soviet Government started to produce and disseminate aerial propaganda leaflets for Germans on June 22, 1941, the day the German Wehrmacht invaded Russia. The leaflet campaign of the 'Soviet Central Series' continued to the very last day of World War II, May 8, 1945."</p>
<p>All propaganda pamphlets are numbered; the pamphlet number is placed prominently at the beginning of each entry. Materials are organized by the same numerical system Kircher used in his published works. Only those numbers listed are found in the collection.</p>
<p>Kirchner's organizational system, translations, text selection, and notes have retained his original description. A key to the item descriptions, including number, first words printed, date, size, preservation grade, means of distribution, and description/translation, begins the container list.</p>
<p>Many of the items are listed or illustrated in Kirchner's books. For more details and reproductions of some "Soviet Central Series" leaflets, see Kirchner's <emph render="italic">Flugbl&#228;tter aus der UdSSR, Juni-August 1941</emph> (vol. 8),  <emph render="italic">Flugbl&#228;tter aus der UdSSR, September-Dezember 1941</emph> (vol. 9), and <emph render="italic">Flugbl&#228;tter aus der UdSSR: Gesamtverzeichnis der strategischen Serie: Bibliographie</emph> (vol. 14).</p>
