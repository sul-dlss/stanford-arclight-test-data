<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Hsu Dau-lin or Xu Daulin (1906-73) was a distinguished legal scholar who made substantial contributions to the Constitutional Law of the Republic of China. After receiving his doctoral degree at University of Berlin in 1932, Xu returned to China and became Chiang Kai-shek's personal secretary. When Chiang published his famous article, "Enemies or Friends?" as a warning to the Japanese militarists in 1934, he published it under Xu's name. In 1937, Xu who was then living in Xikou in Zhejiang Province, Chiang Kai-shek's home village, was hired as a tutor to the generalissimo's twenty-seven-year-old son, Ching-kuo, who had just returned from twelve years in Soviet Russia. In 1938, Xu moved to Rome, where he served as Nationalist China's chargé d'affaires in Italy until 1941. In 1942 he became a department director in the Ministry of Personnel. In 1945 he received a cabinet-level position as director of political affairs of the Executive Yuan. </p>
