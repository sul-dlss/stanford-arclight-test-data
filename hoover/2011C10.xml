<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Raymond R. White collection consists of documents relating to the Stanford antiwar movement and to the wider radical political and countercultural scene in the Palo Alto area in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  White was a member of a conservative group, the Stanford branch of the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF), that actively opposed campus radicals during this period.  Along with other YAF members, White systematically collected materials published by and pertaining to Stanford radicals and the demonstrations that they organized.  He also collected leaflets, pamphlets, and serial issues published by a variety of New Left organizations and counter-cultural groups in the greater Palo Alto area.  The White collection includes some posters and a considerable number of fugitive and ephemeral materials not found in other collections pertaining to radical political movements in the Peninsula during this period.</p>
<p>While much of the White collection centers on the antiwar movement, it also has materials relating to the case of Stanford University professor and Venceremos leader H. Bruce Franklin, whose teaching career at Stanford ended in 1972, after prolonged proceedings initiated by the Stanford administration.  Franklin's dismissal was controversial at the time, as were his political views.  In addition to being a tenured English professor, Franklin  was the leader of Venceremos, a Maoist organization that openly advocated armed struggle as part of its revolutionary program. The result of a split within the Revolutionary Union (which later became the Revolutionary Communist Party), Venceremos aligned itself with the Black Panther Party and other militant organizations active in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time.</p>
<p>The White collection comprises the largest set of documents in the archives specifically relating to Stanford and its environs during the turbulent era of the Vietnam War and the mass protests that arose in opposition to it.  Although its creation and order were determined by the conservative political agenda of White and his collaborators, the collection will provide researchers with a detailed view of the groups that were most active in the radical movement at Stanford and in the Palo Alto area at the time.  It will also show that Stanford had its own radical milieu, and although it was much smaller than the Berkeley movement of the same era, it was one that had a significant impact on campus life.</p>
