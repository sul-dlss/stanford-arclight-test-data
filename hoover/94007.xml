<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Harriet Mills McKay was born on November 6, 1896. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert C. Mills. She graduated from Park River High School, North Dakota, and later from the University of North Dakota in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree. Harriet married Douglas McKay soon after her graduation and had two children, Robert and Mary.</p>
<p>In 1937 Harriet moved with her husband and children to the Philippines when Douglas became the manager-director of the Mindanao Mother Lode mines. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, Harriet, Douglas, Mary, and other civilians fled their homes and went into hiding with guerrillas in the jungle for nearly two years. At this time her son Robert was a boarding student at Brent International School in Baguio, and was subsequently interned at the Bilibid internment camp.</p>
<p>In November of 1943 Harriet, Douglas, and Mary were part of a group evacuated from the Philippines to Darwin, Australia, aboard the submarine <emph render="italic">USS Narwhal</emph>. In 1944 they returned to the United States, where Robert joined them after his liberation from Bilibid internment camp in 1945. In 1947, Harriet, Douglas and Mary returned to the Philippines, but due to the poor health of Douglas and Harriet the family returned to the United States. Harriet died on August 13, 1949, and is buried in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Harriet attempted unsuccessfully to publish her memoirs "Black Island" and "No Conqueror Comes." In 2002 her daughter, Mary McKay Maynard, published her own memoir, <emph render="italic">My Faraway Home: An American Family's WWII Tale of Adventure and Survival in the Jungles of the Philippines.</emph></p>
