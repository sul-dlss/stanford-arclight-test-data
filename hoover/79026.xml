            <p>Japanese-American architect and evacuee at Tanforan Assembly Center, California, 1942.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>In February 1942 President Roosevelt issued Executive Order #9066 which enabled the military to evacuate all Americans of Japanese descent from California, Oregon and Washington. Internment camps were planned in the remote areas of Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, Arkansas and California to receive the evacuees.</p> 
<p>The implementation of the order was started in March and evacuation started in April. Since the construction of the permanent camps was just underway, the evacuees were temporarily placed in race tracks, county fair grounds, and livestock exhibition halls hastily converted into detention camps with barbed wire fences, search lights, and guard towers. Tanforan Assemby Center was located at the Tanforan Race Track in San Bruno about ten miles south of San Francisco. It was home to 5000 San Franciscans for about 6 months until the permanent camp in the desert area of Utah was completed, the Central Utah Relocation Center, better known as the Topaz War Relocation Center. </p>

<p>San Francisco was divided into evacuation districts and notices of the departure dates were posted in prominent places. On the appointed day, the evacuees reported to the district depot with bed rolls and hand baggage. No other possessions were allowed. Cameras, radios and weapons (including kitchen knives) had been confiscated previously. Transportation to Tanforan was by means of Army commandeered buses.</p> 
<p>The content of the collection is 24 photographic copies of sketches depicting the physical facilities at the Tanforan Assembly Center. Titles and descriptions from paperwork included with images.</p>

                    <p>Composed of a front and rear compartment--some with no door between. Exterior doors were rough woods planks and the windows were mostly fixed in place. There were no windows in the rear compartments. Flood was either existing asphalt or new wood planks over earth. Partitions between apartments stopped at the top horizontal plate and the space above was open. The least sound traveled from one end of the building to the other. There were neither plumbing nor heating and one single light bulb on a pull chain per compartment. Reminder of the former occupants was quite strong.</p>

                    <p>The buildings with stairs were mess halls and the two small buildings on the right were toilets. Other buildings shown were barrack apartments built to supplement the horse stalls. They were flimsily constructed with tar paper on the outside walls held in place by batens. Roof was thing roll roofing. The single wood plank floor on the inside shrank leaving gaps of 1/2" or more through which the wind whistled. As in the horse stalls, the partition between apartment units were partial. Here again, no plumbing, no heating and a single light bulb on pull chain. Size of a typical apartment was 16 x 20 ft. with an average occupancy of 6. Privacy within the apartment was achieved by stringing up blankets etc. The camp was divided into blocks of barracks housing about 300. Each block had its own mess hall, toilets and showers. One laundry building served two blocks.</p>
