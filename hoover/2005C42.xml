            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The Paul B. Henze papers consist of diaries, writings, correspondence, notes, memoranda, reports, research materials, printed matter, and photographs relating to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty broadcasting to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; conditions in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and the former Soviet Union, especially the Caucasus and Central Asia; and conditions in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. The papers include publications of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, and related organizations, as well as research materials for the numerous books and articles written by Henze, particularly 
                <emph render="italic">The Plot to Kill the Pope</emph> (New York, 1983).</p>
            <p>In 1952, Paul B. Henze, a World War II veteran and recent Harvard graduate in Soviet studies, moved to Munich to serve as Radio Free Europe's deputy political advisor. For nearly six years, Henze worked closely with William E. Griffith, RFE's chief political advisor, to shape the policies and programs of the growing radio station. Correspondence, memoranda, guidances, and reports from these early years can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Radio Free Europe file</emph>. Of particular interest are files documenting RFE's conduct during the 1956 Hungarian uprising, flyers from balloon campaigns in Czechoslovakia, and reports on Polish defectors. In addition to writing policy and background reports, Henze traveled frequently to negotiate the construction of an RFE transmitter site outside Istanbul. Documents from this failed attempt can be found in the Chronological subseries.</p>
            <p>Although Henze left Radio Free Europe in 1958 for a position in Turkey, his interest in the organization continued throughout his life. In the 1960s, Henze was involved in the Radio Study Group, a CIA-led project to assess the funding and future of RFE. Some of the research materials in the Radio Free Europe file were assembled for this initiative. Later, while on staff at the National Security Council during the Carter Administration, Henze served as a liaison between the White House and the Board for International Broadcasting. Files from this period chronicle efforts to move the headquarters of RFE from Munich to the United States. After retiring from government service, Henze continued to write and lecture on the history of RFE, as reflected in his speeches and writings.</p>
            <p>In his 30 years of government service, Henze held high-level positions in Turkey, Ethiopia, and Carter's White House. Aside from National Security Council documents related to Radio Free Europe, Henze's papers do not include working files from these postings. After retiring from public service in December 1980, Henze began to research and write extensively on subjects that were formerly under his purview as a government employee, such as the Horn of Africa and the non-Russian nationalities of the Soviet Union. His research and writings, as received by the Archives, were grouped by these subjects, and can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Horn of Africa</emph>, 
                <emph render="bold">Caucasus</emph> and 
                <emph render="bold">Central Asia files</emph>.</p>
            <p>While employed by the RAND Corporation, Henze became famous for his book 
                <emph render="italic">The Plot to Kill the Pope</emph>, which, along with the work of Claire Sterling, popularized the "Bulgarian connection" in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II. In his book, related articles, television appearances, and film scripts, all of which are located in 
                <emph render="bold">
                    <emph render="italic">The Plot to Kill the Pope</emph> file</emph>, Henze sought to show that that Soviet Union was behind the actions of Mehmet Ali Ağca.</p>
            <p>Although Henze grouped his papers, including the bulk of his correspondence, by his research interests, he kept a separate file of extensive personal letters with friends such William Griffith, Richard Pankhurst, and Ralph Walter, which can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> series. Items in his 
                <emph render="bold">Biographical file</emph>, such as an application to work at Radio Free Europe and photographs of his wife and children, comprise some of the earliest items in the collection.</p>
            <p>A productive writer from an early age, Henze began keeping detailed diaries while a soldier and later as a military government official in Germany from 1944-1945. Henze's 
                <emph render="bold">World War II diaries</emph> formed the basis for his undergraduate thesis and provide a glimpse into the daily life of an American soldier during the occupation of Germany.</p>
