            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection of papers of Alexander Vardy (Aleksandr Markovich Lifits) primarily covers Vardy's work for Radio Liberty in Munich from 1963 to his retirement in 1980. It includes broadcast transcripts; correspondence; labor camp anecdotes, poetry, and songs; printed matter; and writings. Phonotapes of broadcasts, interviews, and songs are also included.</p>
            <p>Born in Smolensk, Vardy had by 1936 finished three semesters at the Technical Institute for Mechanics in Moscow and studied law at the Moscow Law School. In 1936 he was arrested and kept in the prisons of Lubianka and Butyrka. The same year he was sentenced to three years in forced labor camps. Released in 1939, he returned home and graduated from engineering college in 1941.</p>
            <p>In July 1941 Vardy was mobilized to join the Soviet Army and fought the Germans until the end of World War II. He was arrested again in 1950 as a "political recidivist" and sentenced to ten years in transpolar forced labor camps. After five years Vardy was released and rehabilitated.</p>
            <p>In 1957 Alexander Vardy and his family left for Poland, and later the same year he emigrated to Israel. His 146 articles and book 
                <emph render="italic">The Ice Hole</emph> were published in Israel and abroad.</p>
            <p>In 1962 Vardy joined Radio Liberty in Munich, West Germany. From 1963 to his retirement in 1980 he wrote and produced more then 2000 radio programs about Soviet science, ideology, politics and economics.</p>
            <p>The largest and perhaps most interesting series of papers is RADIO LIBERTY BROADCAST TRANSCRIPTS, which documents not only Vardy's broadcasts, but also a huge variety of other Radio Liberty broadcasts about events and people. Famous authors and Russian dissidents are the subject of, wrote, or otherwise participated in many of the programs for which transcripts are available.</p>
            <p>Also of interest is the material relating to Vardy's publications, including articles and notes about Jews, German and Soviet media on anti-Semitism and Nazism; and two books, 
                <emph render="italic">The Ice Hole</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">World Under Convoy</emph>, about Russian concentration camps.</p>
            <p>The series WRITINGS BY OTHERS contains works of famous Russian poets and writers.</p>
