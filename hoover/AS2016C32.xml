    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The collection of newspapers, journals, and magazines in Dari, Pushto, Arabic, and English represent the viewpoints of diverse groups, including the leftist revolutionary People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah-loyalists, various factions of Afghan Mujaheddin and foreign-backed jihadists, the Taliban-led government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as well as the Karzai regime, during a tumultuous period in the nation's history in which successive waves of foreign influence and invasion destabilized the region, resulting in more than three decades of armed struggle.</p><p> Print material in the collection covers events including the aftermath of the 1978 Saur revolution, the lives of political exiles and refugees in Pakistan, the complex interactions of anti-Soviet insurgency groups and their foreign backers in the U.S. and the Muslim world, the fall of Najibullah and civil war thereafter, the radicalization of foreign fighters in Kunar and Tora Bora, the rise and fall of the Taliban, the events of September 11, 2001, "Operation Enduring Freedom," the establishment of Hamid Karzai as president, and the continuing International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition occupation. Ranging from radical Islamists in favor of global jihad to cautious social democrats in support of civil society, the collection demonstrates the extraordinary range of ideologies and voices competing for mindshare in modern Afghanistan.</p><p> Many of the serials are vividly illustrated with reproductions of photographic portraits, battlefield scenes, cityscapes, and martyrs fallen to various causes, while others, in accordance with strict interpretation of Sharia law, eschew visual imagery altogether.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>In the digital collection, each publication contains an English-language translation, as well as vernacular text and transliterations of all titles, subtitles and mastheads, and publishers. A holistic transliteration methodology was adopted which was informed through recourse to WorldCat references and other digital holdings, linguistic preference for Dari and Pushto words of Arabic origin (i.e. Hizb rather than Hezb, or Mujaheddin rather than Mojahedin), and finally, popular convention and deference to spellings preferred by the publication itself (Hewad rather than Haywad, for instance). Lastly, true to the intent of the media as a fluid medium that places a premium on communication and absorption of information, diacritical markings that are a mainstay in scholarly publications are largely absent.</p><p> Discovery for newspapers is at the issue-page level; discovery for journals is at the article level (with a rich search discovery possible for key words and names in journal article titles and article authors). Presentation is in the form of scanned images in PDF format.</p>  </scopecontent>

This serial was published during the transitional years between Mohammad Zahir Shah’s rule and the establishment of Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan’s revolutionary government; the party and its serial promoted wider unity between Afghanistan's ethnicities. The newspaper continued for four additional months, through July 1969; those issues are not present in this collection.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref14" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">کمک (Kumak, Help)</emph>, اسد 1347 (Asad) 10</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">(1968 August 1)</unitdate></did><scopecontent audience="internal" id="aspace_ref15"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>No. 1 (all published?).

But when Moscow sent troops to Kabul to prop up the failing communist government in 1979, their resistance swiftly escalated into full-scale insurgency. Well-funded, often foreign-backed jihadists hounded Soviet forces throughout the country, leading Mikhail Gorbachev to order their withdrawal in 1989. Various Mujaheddin factions continued the struggle against Mohammad Najibullah's tottering regime until it fell in 1992, when they turned their weapons against one another. Throughout the conflict, many of the parties (including Jamiat-i Islami, Hezb-e Islami, and others) published newspapers and magazines to record their accomplishments and seek greater legitimacy. Foreign governments, including Iran, contributed pro-Mujaheddin literature, as did pan-Arab Islamist organizations, which published their own magazines to encourage jihad and solicit donations at home and abroad.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref34" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">حبلو الله (Hablu Allah, Rope of Allah)</emph>, اسد 1363 (Asad) 30 - ثور 1369 (Saur) 10</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">(1984 August 21 - 1990 April 30)</unitdate></did><scopecontent audience="internal" id="aspace_ref35"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>No. 2 through no. 68 (six year run, near complete, lacking 12 nos.: 1, 3-4, 8-10, 12, 28, 56).
