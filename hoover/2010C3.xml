<head>Historical Note</head> 
	<p>The Mu'assasat al-dh&#x0101;kirah al-'Ir&#x0101;q&#x012B;yah (Iraq Memory Foundation (IMF)) is a private nonprofit organization for documentation of Iraqi history under the Ba'th party regime. It was founded by Kanan Makiya in 1992 as the Iraq Research and Documentation Project (IRDP) at Harvard University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Makiya had just returned from a November 1991 trip to northern Iraq, where he viewed the archive of documents of the Hi&#7827;b al-Ba'th al-'Arab&#2909; al-Ishtir&#x012B;k&#2909; (Ba'th Arab Socialist Party of Iraq) that had been seized by Iraqi rebels. Makiya was accompanied by a BBC filmmaker who filmed his investigation of the Iraqi government's campaign of ethnic cleansing of Iraqi Kurds (the Anfal). The film, <emph render="italic">The Road to Hell</emph>, aired in January 1992 on BBC and then on PBS as a <emph render="italic">Frontline</emph> documentary under the title "Saddam's Killing Fields." Now president of the Iraq Memory Foundation, Makiya is the Sylvia Hassenfeld Professor of Modern Middle East Studies at Brandeis University. He has written many books, including <emph render="italic">Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq</emph> (1989).</p>
<p>In 1993 the IRDP developed a plan to preserve the Ba'thist documents Makiya had examined in Iraq. Over the next ten years the IRDP received and processed documents and transcribed Iraqi refugee interviews. </p>
<p>After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, the IRDP relocated to Baghdad, where it registered as a Jam'iyah (society) in Iraq under the name Iraq Memory Foundation. It expanded its mission to include documenting all facets of the Iraqi experience under the regime of Saddam Hussein from 1968 to 2003. Also in 2003, the IMF acquired the Ba'th Regional Command collection from the basement of the Ba'th party headquarters in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The IMF began its Oral History on Film Project, which records the testimonies of witnesses to Ba'th regime repression, in 2003. Documentary filmmaker Mustafa Al-Kadhimiy, who formerly headed the Department of Programs and Planning at al-Iraqiyya television, led the project. In 2005, al-Iraqiyya began broadcasting ten-minute excerpts from the testimonies during prime time and they quickly became one of Iraq's top-rated TV programs. The IMF went on to produce several seasons of a series called <emph render="italic">Legacy of Evil</emph> for Iraqi television. This weekly program consists of interviews with witnesses, Saddam-era video footage, and presentations of documents created by the regime. In total, the IMF has more than 1700 hours of footage, including videos created by the Ba'th regime (now allocated to the Hi&#x1E93;b al-Ba'th al-'Arab&#x012B; al-Ishtir&#x0101;k&#x012B; in Iraq records at Hoover), oral histories, the <emph render="italic">Legacy of Evil</emph> archive, and Saddam Hussein trial videorecordings. The IMF claims the copyrights on all the oral history videos it produces (IMF Prospectus 2008, page 26, box 1).</p>
<p>On September 21, 2005, IMF directors Kanan Makiya and Hassan Mneimneh testified before the human rights caucus of the U.S. Congress on the importance of the work of the IMF. The IMF also provided documents for use in the trial of Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Videorecordings of oral histories of 190 survivors of Ba'th Party repression. </p>
<p>Two finding aids are available. One is descriptions of the interviewees from the <emph render="italic"><title render="italic">Iraqi Testimonies</title></emph> DVD packaging, which are listed under <emph render="italic"><title render="italic">Iraqi Testimonies</title></emph> video boxed sets, but relate to all of the <emph render="italic"><title render="italic">Iraqi Testimonies</title></emph> series. These descriptions were taken essentially verbatim from this packaging (some spelling errors were corrected and some proper names were standardized to a single spelling). </p>
<p>A second finding aid is the IMF database at the Hoover Institution, which can be searched by name of interviewee, with names entered in a mixture of Arabic and English. In the database, each name will include rushes (raw, unedited video footage of interviews, often several hours), the edited clip for broadcast on al-Iraqiyya television and distribution in DVD boxed sets, and a transcript of the broadcast video clip. Most individual files also include textual information including biographical information forms on the interviewee and a research form completed by IMF to verify the interviewee's story. </p>
<p>A selection of the videos also includes a video clip with English subtitles. A list of these interviewees with descriptions is appended to this finding aid.</p>
