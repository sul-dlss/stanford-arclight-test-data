            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Stafford was an American missionary in China from 1909 to 1915 and 1932 to 1933. A lithographer and photographer, he arrived in Shanghai in 1909 and was hired by the Commercial Press-then Asia's largest publishing company--to manage its printing division from 1909 to 1915. During the onset of the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, Stafford was on hand to capture remarkable photos of the Qing Dynasty's collapse.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The collection, which consists of nearly 1,100 images, includes the largest number of surviving original photographic prints of the Chinese Revolution of 1911. Stafford's historic pictorials record the turbulent period between 1910 and 1933, as China transitioned from feudal monarchy to republic. Depicted are battle scenes, military and political figures, as well as everyday people, life, and culture in China. Also included are rare glimpses of printing operations and employees of the Commercial Press.</p>
            <p>Stafford's photos first appeared in such publications as the 
                <emph render="italic">Da Ge Ming Xie Zhen Hua (War Scenes of the Chinese Revolution)</emph> and were reproduced as illustrated posters. His work has also been highlighted in several major museum exhibitions in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In 2010 the University of Washington Press republished 162 of the photographs in 
                <emph render="italic">The Birth of a Republic: Francis Stafford's Photographs of China's 1911 Revolution and Beyond</emph>. As noted by the book's editor, Hanchao Lu, Stafford's unique photographs "reveal sweeping social and political change, as well as the tenacity of tradition" and "appeal to historians interested in modern China, revolution, and war."</p>
