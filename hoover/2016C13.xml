            <p>The Maciej Milczanowski photographs collection consists of 472 photographs, divided into 10 subject groupings by Milczanowski. The photographs depict Coalition Forces patrols or convoys, bases, Iraqi archeological sites, and scenes from the daily life of officers and soldiers: work in the headquarters, training, recreation, and encounters with the Iraqi civilian population.</p>
            <p>The photographs were taken at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006. Milczanowski took all of the photographs except those in Folder 6, Convoy Camp Echo - Camp Victory (Baghdad), which were taken at his request by Captain Nikolay Niedialkov from the Bulgarian Battalion under Polish Brigade command.</p>
            <p>Also included in the collection are some related digital files, including Milczanowski's descriptions of the photographs and two PowerPoints.</p>
            <p>Milczanowski's groupings, numbering, and descriptions have been maintained in this finding aid, with minor edits for clarity.</p>

                    <p>For the first five months of duty in Iraq, Milczanowski was stationed in Diwaniyah. The Polish Brigade was under Multinational Division Central-South (MND-CS), which also consisted mostly of Polish officers, but under the Brigade were two battalions -- one Polish, stationed in Al-Hillah (Charlie Base) and another Bulgarian, in Echo.</p>

                    <p>Just after New Year 2005/2006, Milczanowski and his unit moved to Al-Kut to take over the base left by the Ukrainians. The base was poorly protected, surrounded only by fences, compared to Dianiyah, which was surrounded by T-walls (also known as Bremer walls, steel-reinforced concrete blast walls). There was just one battalion (and a small staff of the brigade) to organize all protection in the towers, patrols inside and outside the base, and convoys. The Ukrainians who had left the base had a whole brigade for the same purpose.</p>
