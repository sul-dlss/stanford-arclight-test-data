            <p>The Theodore Abel papers contain diaries, other writings, and printed matter related to sociological theory and world politics. The collection also includes autobiographical sketches (biograms) by members of the Nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiter-Partei, relating to their reasons for becoming national socialists, collected by Abel as research material for his book 
                <title render="italic">Why Hitler Came into Power: An Answer Based on the Original Life Stories of Six Hundred of His Followers </title>(1938).</p>
            <p>Abel collected the autobiographies of hundreds of followers of Adolf Hitler in 1934 as source material to improve upon the understanding of the Hitler movement. While visiting Germany in the summer of 1933, Abel was struck by the willingness of many Germans to discuss their political experiences. To follow up on this, in June 1934 he announced a prize contest designed to induce Hitler's followers to submit their life stories. He posted this announcement at all local headquarters of the Nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiter-Partei and in the party press:</p>
            <p/>
<blockquote>
    <p>For the Best Personal Life History of an Adherent of the Hitler Movement</p>
    <p>Any person, regardless of sex or age, who was a member of the National Socialist party before January 1, 1933, or who was in sympathy with the movement, may participate in this contest.</p>
    <p>Contestants are to give accurate and detailed descriptions of their personal lives, particularly after the World War. Special attention should be given to accounts of family life, education, economic conditions, membership in associations, participation in the Hitler movement, and important experiences, thoughts, and feelings about events and ideas of the post-war period.</p>
    <p>The prizes will be awarded to authors who have submitted the most detailed and trustworthy accounts. Style, spelling, or dramatic story value will not be considered. Completeness and frankness are the sole criteria, so that even the simplest and most undramatic story will receive full consideration.</p>
    <p>The prizes will be awarded as follows:</p>
    <p>First prize . . . . . . 125 marks</p>
    <p>Second prize . . . . 50 marks</p>
    <p>Third prize . . . . . . 25 marks</p>
    <p>Five prizes . . . . . 20 marks each</p>
    <p>Ten prizes . . . . . . 10 marks each</p>
    <p>The prize money is deposited in the German Bank. The contest is organized under the tutelage of the sociology department of Columbia University, whose members will be the final judges. The purpose of the contest is the collection of material on the history of National Socialism, so that the American public may be informed about it on the basis of factual, personal documents.</p>
    <p/>
</blockquote>            
            <p>Abel received 683 manuscripts, the content of which he felt justified the project and the personal expense of paying for the prizes. Of these 683 manuscripts, 48 were written by women and were not considered by Abel for the study published as 
                <emph render="italic">Why Hitler Came into Power</emph> (he planned a separate article about the women's histories). Also excluded from study for the book were a score of biographies of one or two pages that contained very little information.</p>
            <p>The autobiographies, called biograms in this finding aid, contain data on age, occupation, socioeconomic class, education, employment, membership in various associations, place of residence, marital status, military service in World War I, participation in military activities after World War I, first contacts with the National Socialist movement, the main reason for joining the movement, expressions of anti-Semitism, etc. Abel's assessment of the reliability and objectivity of the biograms is included in the introduction to his book, which is also the source of this scope and content note.</p>
            <p>The incremental materials consist of diaries, speeches and writings, course materials, and printed matter. Two of Abel's later diaries can be found in this file, as well as diary transcriptions. The file includes Abel's speeches and writings on sociology, including writings on Verstehen and various book reviews. The course materials include extensive handwritten notes by Abel on topics such as Max Weber and social theory.</p>

Typically, each autobiography contains information on the writer's occupation, socioeconomic class, education, employment, membership in various associations, place of residence, marital status, military service in World War I, participation in military activities after World War I, first contacts with the National Socialist movement, the main reason for joining the movement, expressions of anti-Semitism, etc.</p>
