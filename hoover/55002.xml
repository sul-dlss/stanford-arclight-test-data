<head>Historical Note</head> 
<p>These data files were developed on behalf of the Chief of Naval Operations Cross Cultural Survey Staff at Yale University. They were donated by the Navy Department to the Hoover Institution in November 1955. </p>

<p>From this raw data, a series of <title render="italic">Civil Affairs Handbooks</title> were prepared at the School of Naval Administration at Columbia University, in the period of 1943-1945, to be used by military government organizations moving into the areas surrendered by the Japanese. </p>

<p>For a working project outline the Cross Cultural Survey staff adapted an index and outline guide that had been set up for processing anthropological data concerning indigenous cultures of the Americas. A highly trained staff reviewed materials in western languages and some in Japanese. Abstracts and condensations of useful information were put on 5x8 inch slips and filed according to a numerical key to the Cross Cultural Survey outline. </p>

<p>Five sets of the files were established, with one each at Yale University, Columbia University, the Smithsonian Institution, the Fifth Naval District Intelligence Office (New York), and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations at Washington. </p>

<p>Two research units were established at Columbia University. Under the direction of Commander George P. Murdock, one unit prepared <title render="italic">Civil Affairs Handbooks</title>  for the Japanese mandated islands, the Ryukyus, and the Izu and Bonin Islands. The other, under the direction of Lieutenant George H. Kerr, prepared ten <title render="italic">Handbooks</title>  (one covering the Formosa as a unit, one each for eight administrative subdivisions, and one <title render="italic">Economic Supplement</title>, done in cooperation with the Department of Commerce). Contributions were made to other agencies preparing Handbooks concerning Fisheries and Agriculture in Formosa. Materials were assembled for a Handbook on the aboriginal people of Formosa, but this was not completed before the military decision to bypass Formosa was made, and the intensive Formosa research and training program was abandoned. </p>

<p>In 1946 one set of Formosa materials was transferred from the Navy Department (Washington) through the Department of State to the American Consulate in Taipei. The Smithsonian set is reportedly at the Library of Congress. Two sets of Formosa materials used at Columbia in preparing the Navy <title render="italic">Handbooks</title> series are now in the Hoover Institution together with duplicate sets of material on Micronesia, the Ryukyus, and other areas. </p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The survey file has been divided into island groups as follows:</p>
<p>I. 	Bonun and Izu Islands</p>
<p>II. 	Carolines</p>
		<p>    Eastern Carolines</p>
		<p>    East Central Carolines</p>
		<p>    Western Carolines</p>
		<p>    West Central Carolines</p>
<p>III. 	Hokkaido</p>
<p>IV.	Kuriles</p>
<p>V.	Marianas</p>
<p>VI. 	Marshalls</p>
<p>VII.	Micronesia</p>
<p>VIII.	Nauru</p>
<p>IX.	Ryukyus</p>
<p>X.	Formosa (Taiwan)</p>
		<p>    Bibliography Section, Formosa (Taiwan)</p>
		<p>    Geographical Section, Formosa (Taiwan)</p>
		<p>    Topical Section, Formosa (Taiwan)</p>
<p>Burma, Siam and Indonesia</p>
<p>The group is indicated in the upper right hand corner of the card. The cards for most island groups are coded by numbers by country following the numeric codes in the <title render="italic">Outline of Cultural Materials: A working Manual Prepared for Emergency use by the Cross-Cultural Survey and the Strategic Index of the Americas, Volume II,</title> Yale Anthropological Studies. A copy is available at the Hoover Institution. </p>

<p>In the upper left hand corner of each card appear three or four numbers (i.e. 1453) which are always underscored or checked by pencil. This is the survey number. The first two numerals (i.e. 14) indicate the major classification. Each major classification is then subdivided into minor classed by the third numeral, (i.e. 5). The minor classes may then be subdivided into sub-minor classes, indicated by the forth numeral (i.e. 3) 1453 would then be filed as class 14, minor group 5, sub-minor group 3. A sub-minor group is not always given. </p>

<p>Above the survey number is a source citation to the book number, author's name, and page number. Cards were filed by survey number, and within each survey number by book. For filing purposes, the author's name is ignored. </p>

<p>In the O.N.I./Cross Cultural Survey Files is a Data File Guide. This document contains an explanation of the subject matter of each major classification and its corresponding sub-divisions. </p>

<p>Island groups I-VII are explained in the Yale University Index. Group IX, the Ryukyus, uses the same basic system as Groups I through VIII except that the fourth numeral, for sub-minor groups, is not used in the survey number. </p>

<p>Group X, Formosa (Taiwan) is based on a different classification system due to its complexity and size. The original Index and Outline was devised for a body of materials concerning primitive societies. It served its purpose well in supporting research and publication on Micronesia, and was used in preparing the Civil Affairs Handbook for the Ryukyus.  It was inadequate for filing data descriptive of the complex social and economic organization of contemporary Formosa. </p>

<p>The Formosa files at Columbia University were thereby recast. One set was organized under geographic headings, with topical subdivisions subordinate to the geographic divisions. A duplicate set was organized under topical headings, with geographic subdivisions wherever this could be done appropriately. </p>

<p>A substantial collection of photographs and photo-negatives is interfiled at appropriate places throughout these sets. </p>

<p>One set of Formosa materials at the Hoover Institution is set up under geographic headings, with topical subdivisions; the other is arranged under topical headings with geographic subdivision. Two set of materials for each of the other areas continue to be arranged according to the numerical Index of the original Cross Cultural Survey processing. </p>

<p>Note: In the course of repeated transfers between 1944 and 1955 the files were seriously disarranged. Persons using the files are requested to call attention to misfiled items. </p>

<head>Formosa (Taiwan) Data File Guide</head>
<p>The arrangement of the Formosa data files at the Hoover Institute does not follow the numerical index system prepared at New Haven by the Cross Cultural Survey staff. The original Index and Outline was devised for a body of materials concerning primitive societies. It served its purpose well in supporting research and publication on Micronesia, and was used in preparing the Civil Affairs Handbook for the Ryukyus.  It was inadequate for filing data descriptive of the complex social and economic organization of contemporary Formosa. </p>

<p>The Formosa files at Columbia University were thereby recast. One set was organized under geographic headings, with topical subdivisions subordinate to the geographic divisions. A duplicate set was organized under topical headings, with geographic subdivisions wherever this could be done appropriately. </p>
<p>The present Index Guide represents the arrangement of materials within the Topical File.</p>
<p>Note: In the course of repeated transfers between 1944 and 1955 the files were seriously disarranged. Persons using the files are requested to call attention to misfiled items.</p>
