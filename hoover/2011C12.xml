<head>Biographical Note</head> 
<p>Simoncic served on the Czech desk of Radio Free Europe from its beginning; among his earliest papers are press reviews to be broadcast dated June 1951. Later papers (1970s-80s) deal with labor relations at RFE/RL and with the creation of the Society of International Broadcasters, a membership organization established in 1977 and devoted to promoting the interests of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's (RFE/RL) employees as well as the interests of U.S. international broadcasting by putting pressure on the U.S. government to continue and expand its support of international broadcasting. The organization was headed by Major General C. Rodney Smith, a former director of RFE/RL.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>Correspondence, radio broadcast scripts, reports, memoranda, and printed matter, relating to Radio Free Europe broadcasts to Czechoslovakia, and to activities of the Society of International Broadcasters in representing the interests of current and retired RFE/RL employees. The collection is especially significant in that it supplements the corporate records of RFE/RL, Inc., and adds to our knowledge of how it operated. Until now, the RFE/RL corporate records, which are also housed at the Hoover Institution, though extensive, are incomplete; the early period of the Radios' existence has been particularly poorly represented. </p>
