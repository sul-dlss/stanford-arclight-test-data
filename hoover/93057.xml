            <p>We Supported Our Men in Vietnam, Inc. grew out of the Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade, which was organized by New York fire chief Ray Gimmler in 1967. The parade was held on May 13, 1967 along 5th Avenue in New York City and included thousands of people in attendance. Gimmler was moved to organize the event after learning that demonstrators had burned the American flag during an anti-war demonstration in April of 1967. The goal of the parade was not only to counteract the growing anti-war movement of the time, but to show American servicemen in Vietnam that they had the support and backing of the American people.</p>
            <p>Throughout the rest of the Vietnam War, the group was simply known as the Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade Committee (sometimes also referred to as the Support Our 
                <emph render="italic">Men</emph> in Vietnam Parade Committee). Gimmler continued to lead the group as director and chairman with John M. Connolly, Jr. and Frank J. D'Amico serving as co-directors. In addition to proving that the majority of Americans supported servicemen abroad, at this time the organization focused on many other issues related to the war, including the treatment of American prisoners of war (POWs) and soldiers who were missing in action (MIA). They established the Council for Civilized Treatment of POWs and became active members of other patriotic committees, such as the National Committee for Responsible Patriotism and the National Committee for the Protection of Patriotic Americans.</p>
            <p>In 1973 the group helped organize another parade in New York City, the Home with Honor Parade. It was held on March 31, the day after the U.S. officially announced it would withdraw from Vietnam. Although smaller than the Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade, the Home with Honor Parade also drew thousands of attendees. Participants marched from Times Square to Central Park behind approximately 1,000 servicemen who had recently returned home from the war.</p>
            <p>In 1985 the organization officially changed its name to We Supported Our Men in Vietnam, Inc. and shifted its focus to the creation and distribution of the documentary, 
                <emph render="italic">At Home with Honor</emph>. It was composed of footage from different parades and events held for Vietnam servicemen, both during and after the war. For a full list of the events covered in the documentary, see note in the U-matic videocassettes section of the Audiovisual Material series.</p>
            <p>During the organization's final years, the group distributed approximately 2,000 copies of 
                <emph render="italic">At Home with Honor</emph> to American Legion posts, U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers, and Air Force Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) colleges. They also donated copies of the film to the National Archives and the Library of Congress and arranged for showings of the film at local community, veteran, and political organizations. On October 24, 1989, We Supported Our Men in Vietnam, Inc. received a George Washington Honor Medal from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge for excellence in programs and activities for their work on 
                <emph render="italic">At Home with Honor</emph>. The organization concluded its activities in 1995.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
            <p>The We Supported Our Men in Vietnam records contain correspondence, clippings, photographs, scrapbooks, memorabilia, motion picture film, and sound and video recordings that document the organization’s efforts to mobilize support for Americans who served in the Vietnam War. The materials in the collection span the active dates of the organization, from 1965 to 1995, with the majority of the materials being from the late 1960s and late 1980s.</p>
            <p>Much of the material pertains to the Support Our Boys in Vietnam and Home with Honor parades, as well as the group’s documentary, 
                <emph render="italic">At Home with Honor</emph>, created in 1985. In addition, the collection contains materials related to the Council for the Civilized Treatment of POWs Committee, a subdivision of the organization led by John M. Connolly, Jr., and other patriotic organizations that Chairman Ray Gimmler was active in.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> series contains materials originally organized and housed in binders by the organization. It includes several letters of support and thanks from national and local New York government officials, members of the public, as well as servicemen and their families. It also contains letters to television studios, political figures, and various organizations arguing that the majority of Americans supported the troops during the Vietnam War, contrary to what was being depicted in the media. Press releases and clippings regarding the group’s activities and Vietnam veteran issues are intermixed throughout these files. More of this type of material, as well as photographs of events, can be found in scrapbooks in the 
                <emph render="bold">Oversized Material</emph> series.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Material</emph> series contains footage of the Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade held in New York City on May 13, 1967, as well as recordings of Ray Gimmler’s radio and television appearances speaking on behalf of the organization. It also contains copies of the organization's documentary, 
                <emph render="italic">At Home with Honor</emph>, which was sent to a number of military and veteran organizations along with a questionnaire about the film. Completed questionnaires can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Projects and Events</emph> series.</p>
            <p>Posters, signs, and buttons from the various events the group participated in can be found in the 
                <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> and 
                <emph render="bold">Oversized Material</emph> series. This includes material used in the Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade, a “Free the Pueblo” demonstration, and events regarding Vietnam POW/MIA issues.</p>

            <head>Arrangement Statement</head>
            <p>Within each series the materials were generally kept in the original arrangement and order of the creator. Original file names were also preserved and are denoted by quotation marks. It should also be noted that the organization often used the terms "boys" and "men" interchangeably in their name as well as in the title of their 1967 parade. For clarity, in this finding aid "boys" was used when referring to the 1967 parade and the organization prior to 1985 (i. e. Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade and Support Our Boys in Vietnam Parade Committee), while "men" was used when referring to the organization after 1985 (i. e. We Supported Our Men in Vietnam, Inc.).</p>

                    <p>Contains material originally housed in binders. It includes correspondence between the directors of We Supported Our Men in Vietnam, Inc. and government officials, servicemen and their families, and members of the public with clippings, press releases, and other printed matter dispersed throughout.

                    <p>Because the creator organized some of these files by subject and others by correspondent, it may be necessary to search several files that span the same date range when conducting research. Some correspondence also appears in the scrapbooks found in the
