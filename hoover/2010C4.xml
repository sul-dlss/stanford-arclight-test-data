            <p>This collection consists of selected 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> (records series) from what were the fifty-four 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> in Fond No. K-1, Lietuvos SSR Valstybės Saugumo Komitetas (Committee of State Security of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, LSSR KGB), 1940-1991, held at the Lietuvos Ypatingasis Archyvas (Lithuanian special archives).</p>
            <p>Over the years that Hoover acquired these materials, the Lithuanian special archives renamed many of the 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> in Fond K-1 and assigned them new 
                <emph render="italic">fond</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">opis</emph> numbers. As a result, the materials at Hoover are described in three categories: (1) Fond No. K-1 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> that are unchanged; (2) Fond No. K-1 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> that Hoover received before new numbers were assigned; and (3) Fond No. K-1 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> that Hoover received after new numbers were assigned. The numbering used at Hoover is outlined below. In all cases, the alternate numbers and titles are provided parenthetically in the series descriptions.</p>

                </table>The collection contains reports, memoranda, correspondence, lists, directives, and other documents related to intelligence and counter-intelligence activities of the secret police against dissident and anti-Soviet movements and to problems with repatriation and nationalism in Lithuania.</p>
            <p>Nearly two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union the Lithuanian KGB-MVD archives are the largest accessible holdings of the Soviet political police (Russian holdings are for all practical purposes closed, and Ukraine just started the process of opening their KGB archives), which were left almost intact in Vilnius, Lithuania, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The materials document the establishment and operation of the Soviet punitive organizations from 1940 to 1991 in a key Soviet republic that was both a frontier region and a bridge to the West. They cover key subjects such as the initial annexation of the Baltic republics; World War II; the post-war struggle against anti-Soviet nationalist guerillas; collectivization of the countryside; reform of the Soviet system after Stalin's death; reactions to upheaval in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Poland in 1980-1981, and the 1989 revolutions in Eastern Europe; reactions to increasing exposure to the West; and the final collapse of the Soviet power.</p>
            <p>The 
                <emph render="italic">fonds</emph> cover different aspects of the establishment, operation, and demise of the KGB in Lithuania: operational material on the struggle against individual and collective political dissent, anti-Soviet guerrillas, foreign intelligence and radio broadcasts (Fond K-1, opis 3); the NKVD-NKGB-MGB-KGB secretariat, which gathered information on political community spirit and activities from local organizations and transferred them to Moscow (Fond K-1, opis 10); political information gathered by the local NKGB-KGB departments, chiefly in Vilnius and Kaunas (Fond K-1, opis 14); a vast collection of material on dissidents, their investigation, interrogation, and trials (Fond K-1, opis 2); files pertaining to 784 convicts and listing more than 700 of those shot during 1944-1947 in the inner prison of the NKGB-MGB of the Lithuanian SSR (Fond K-15, opis 2); documents relating to inspection of surveillance-operative, counterintelligence, and investigatory work of MGB-KGB agencies of the LSSR; materials concerning inspection of punishment administration (Fond K-16, opis 1); documents relating to inspection of internal cells of the LSSR MGB and pretrial detention wards of the LSSR KGB in 
                <emph render="italic">uezds</emph> and cities (Fond K-17, opisi 1 and 2); directives for struggle against the Lithuanian armed underground issued by the oblast level MGB directorates (Fond K-19, opis 1); directives from the SSSR NKGB-MGB-MVD relating to search of state criminals (Fond K-20, opis 1); directives of the SSSR NKVD representative for the Lithuanian SSR relating to the struggle against the armed underground (Fond K-21, opis 1); materials of special SSSR NKVD departments of the 29th territorial Red Army corps, reflecting NKVD efforts of "purging" the 29th corps (former Lithuanian army) of the "hostile and untrustworthy elements" (Fond K-22, opis 1); minutes of the Republican Commission for revision of criminal cases of persons convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes" (Fond K-23, opis 1); reports to the Main Transport Directorate of the SSSR NKGB-KGB and correspondence with communist party institutions and Soviet authorities (Fond K-26, opis 1); orders of the director of the Lithuanian school for training operative personnel and other documents of the school (Fond K-27, opis 1); orders of the NKGB-KGB of the LSSR, its General Service Department, and the Construction Department of the LSSR MGB (Fond K-31, opis 1); working plans, memoranda, and reports prepared by MGB-KGB of the Lithuanian SSR and subdivisions of the NKVD-MVD of the Lithuanian SSR and lists of individuals arrested in Lithuania (mostly in Vilnius and Kaunas) in 1940-1941, memorandum on the activities of individuals suspected of war crimes and residing outside the Soviet Union, and other documents; (Fond K-40, opisi 1 and 2); and correspondence of USSR KGB divisions with KGB divisions in Lithuanian SSR concerning methodological literature and work with KGB cadres and plans, reports, and informational statements of the LSSR KGB subdivisions (Fond K-42, opisi 1 and 2).</p>
            <p>In the case of the microfilm, the 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph> were chosen by the Hoover Institution from records already microfilmed by the Lithuanian special archives. Before sending the microfilm to Hoover the Lithuanian special archives removed some files and pages from the microfilm. Deleted files and pages contained personal names that could not be released due to personal privacy concerns. Entire files removed from the microfilm are indicated in the reel contents list on the microfilm at the beginning of each 
                <emph render="italic">opis</emph>. Pages removed from files on the microfilm are indicated by a splice on the microfilm, but splices can also occur for technical microfilming reasons. In many cases gaps in the sequential pagination in the original file indicate where pages were deleted, as well as how many were deleted. Pages removed from the digitized files, also due to privacy concerns, are indicated by a note in their place within the file.</p>
            <p>Russian-language finding aids created by the Lithuanian special archives are included in the microfilm at the beginning of each 
                <emph render="italic">opisi</emph>, in the Hoover Archives reading room, and within this file. The finding aids are arranged by file number and provide a description, number of pages, and the inclusive dates of each file.</p>
            <p>The microfilm reel numbers used are those originally assigned by the Lithuanian special archives. They do not always run in a continuous, logical sequence, but they contain the entire 
                <emph render="italic">opis</emph>. In addition, the microfilm often refers to the original 
                <emph render="italic">fond</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">opis</emph> numbers, before the Lithuanian special archives renamed and renumbered much of the collection.</p>

Most of the people executed were participants in the June 1941 uprising, policemen, and soldiers in Lithuanian self-defense battalions from 1941 to 1944. Others shot in the inner prison of the NKVD–MGB, though fewer in number, were soldiers of former Lithuanian battalions fighting with German troops, agents of special troops in Germany, participants in the extermination of Jews, Lithuanian and Polish postwar guerilla fighters, and other convicts. The majority of those executed were Lithuanian; others included Byelorussians, Poles, Germans, Russians, Ukrainians, and Latvians.

                    <p>The Investigative Department of the Committee of State Security (KGB) of the Lithuanian SSR operated under various names in 1940-1941 and 1944-1991. This 
                        <emph render="italic">fond</emph> includes files of the First Special Department of the NKVD of the Lithuanian SSR that operated from 1940-1941, the Investigative Department of the NKVD of the Lithuanian SSR that operated from 1944-1953, and the Operative Group of the KGB of the Lithuanian SSR that operated from 1959-1965.</p>
                    <p>The department investigated individuals and groups charged with insurgent and anti-Soviet activities. It also investigated criminal cases of special importance, the so-called state prisoners. Beginning in the spring of 1945 the NKVD spent most of its time investigating guerrilla fighters and their accomplices.</p>
                    <p>From 1944 to 1953 those charged with anti-Soviet activities were sentenced by extrajudicial institutions (e.g., military tribunals or the Special Council). After 1954 these individuals or their family members were allowed to submit to the KGB of the Lithuanian SSR requests to commute the penalties or annul the sentences imposed on them by the extrajudicial institutions. Thus, beginning in 1955, one responsibility of the Investigative Department was reviewing and revising criminal cases.</p>
                    <p>After 1959 KGB and MVD troops liquidated the remnants of the Lithuanian underground. This reduced the number of individuals detained for anti-Soviet crimes and decreased the workload of the Investigative Department.</p>
                    <p>The First Division of the Department investigated "traitors of the Motherland," those who helped foreign countries in activities against the Soviet Union and those involved in anti-Soviet agitation, propaganda, and contraband. This division was also responsible for reviewing archived criminal cases.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in the 1980s the Second Division investigated criminal cases of espionage, divulgence of military secrets, sedition, violation of rules for currency handling, and economic crimes</p>
                    <p>In the 1980s and 1990s heads of divisions investigated the most important cases and took part in reeducating convicted Lithuanian dissidents.</p>
                    <p>The activities of the USSR KGB in Lithuania were officially stopped on 22 August 1991 by the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Lithuania. In October-November of the same year the Investigative Department of the Lithuanian SSR was closed down. Access to its documents is limited in accordance with the laws of the Lithuanian Republic.</p>
                    <p>Fond no. K-40 also includes materials selected by the Operative Team of the LSSR KGB in 1959-1965. Two retired KGB officers operated as a part of the Editorial Board for Documents Publication of the Institute of History of the Academy of Science of the Lithuanian SSR. The board published archival records held in various archival, governmental, and party institutions that supposedly "exposed anti-public policy of Lithuanian and Polish bourgeois nationalists, evil intents and violence that took place in the bourgeois Lithuania." The documents were used for propaganda by the Communist Party of Lithuania. The two officers, along with staff members of the KGB, searched, selected, arranged, and prepared for publication archival documents about the so-called atrocities of bourgeois nationalists on the territory of the Lithuanian SSR.</p>

                    <head>Historical note</head>
                    <p>The Personnel Department of the Committee of State Security of the Lithuanian SSR was first established in 1944 as the Personnel Department of the People’s Commissariat of the Lithuanian SSR (NKGB). In 1946 the NKGB became the Ministry of State Security (MGB), and the Personnel Department was renamed accordingly. It should be noted that not many documents relating to the activities of the department from 1944 to 1953 have survived.</p>
                    <p>When in 1953 the MGB LSSR was superseded by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the LSSR, its Personnel Department became a structural unit of the MVD. In 1954 the Committee for State Security of LSSR was restored, and its Personnel Department was established. It reported to the USSR KGB Personnel Directorate.</p>
                    <p>From 1953 through 1954 it was called the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MGB), then from 1954 through 1978, the Personnel Department of the Committee of State Security attached to the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR. From 1978 through 1991 the Department was called the Personnel Department of the KGB of the Lithuanian SSR</p>
                    <p>Activities of the Personnel Department were governed by resolutions and instructions of the USSR KGB and recommendations of the USSR KGB Personnel Directorate. De jure the chief of the Personnel Department had always been Deputy Chair for Cadres of the LSSR KGB while de facto the Personnel Department was run by the deputy chief of the Personnel Department.</p>
                    <p>In 1954-1955 the Personnel Department consisted of the following divisions: 1st Division, which organized and managed selection, assignment and education of employees; 2nd Division, or special inspectorate, which investigated crime and misdemeanor committed by employees; 3rd Division, or personnel registration office, which was reorganized into a section for registration of the Personnel Department in May 1955; and 4th Division, which handled mobilization; it was later reorganized into a section for mobilization of the Personnel Departments.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the 1960s the Personnel Department started selecting candidates from Lithuania for KGB schools in Moscow, Minsk, Tashkent, and other cities of the USSR and for KGB higher educational institutions in Lithuania, where future KGB employees studied law, foreign languages, journalism, radio electronics, and other subjects.</p>
                    <p>From the 1970s through the 1990s one of the responsibilities of the LSSR KGB Personnel Department was distribution of KGB textbooks, curricula, methodological recommendations, etc., supplied by USSR KGB higher educational institutions.</p>
                    <p>In the 1980s-1990s the Personnel Department was mainly engaged in: (1) Selecting and hiring personnel of the LSSR KGB. New KGB employees were recruited from large industrial enterprises in Lithuania; (2) Forming reservists for intelligence and counterintelligence subdivisions of the LSSR KGB. Candidates were mostly selected by operative divisions, but the final decision on each candidate was made after a complete background check was conducted by the Personnel Department; (3) Training of operatives and LSSR KGB staff development; (4) Working with young employees; (5) Establishing special training and military and physical education for LSSR KGB personnel. From 1976 seminars were organized in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaĭpeda, Šiauliaĭ and other cities to train employees of raĭon level divisions of the LSSR KGB; (6) Strengthening discipline and performing ideological education of LSSR KGB employees; (7) Maintaining personnel files of KGB employees; (8) Planning holiday celebrations for personnel.</p>
                    <p>The Personnel Department also compiled annual evaluation plans for KGB officers, and managed and analyzed evaluation results. Evaluation was performed in close cooperation with the Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party at the LSSR KGB.</p>
                    <p>In 1974 the Personnel Department established courts of honor at the LSSR KGB. In the second half of the 1980s the Personnel Department started paying special attention to “international education of the KGB cadres.” At the beginning of 1987 there were 14 employees in the Personnel Department.</p>
                    <p>On 22 August 1991 the Supreme Soviet (the Seim of the Lithuanian Republic) stopped the activities of the USSR KGB in Lithuania, and in October-November the Personnel Department of the LSS KGB ended its operations.</p>
