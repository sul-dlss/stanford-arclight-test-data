            <p>A Russian political activist, Aleksandr Patiev was deeply involved in Leningrad politics during the Perestroika period, serving as Leningrad/Saint Petersburg municipal councillor from 1990 to 1993. After his retirement from the Municipal Soviet in 1993, he was an advisor to deputies Natalia Evdokimova of the St. Petersburg municipal assembly and Sergei Mironov, the head of the "Spravedlivaia Rossiia" political party.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content of the Collection</head>
            <p>The collection contains papers relating to the establishment of the Leningrad Popular front in the late 1980s, the elections to the Congress of People's Deputies in 1989, in which Patiev was actively involved, and the elections to the Leningrad Municipal Council in 1990, in which he was elected as a deputy. Both of these elections are significant in Soviet history, and Patiev's ample files of correspondence, notes, press, and campaign materials throw important light on the democratic processes at work during Perestroika.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Leningrad Municipal Council from 1990 to 1993, Patiev was involved in the initiative to change the name of the city back to St. Petersburg, and his papers document the difficulties of managing the city through the general economic and political crisis the entire country was going through in the early 1990s.</p>
            <p>The papers reflect Patiev's involvement with cultural projects through period documents as well as later recollections of particularly significant events. These cultural projects -- especially the struggle to preserve architectural landmarks and historical monuments -- were actually at the root of the emergence of the democratic movement in Leningrad during the 1980s. The appearance of new parties and movements in Leningrad/St. Petersburg in the early 1990s is also well documented in Patiev's papers.</p>
