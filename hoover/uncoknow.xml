            <p>Acquired between 2001 and 2011. For the broadcast years, most of the videotapes and audio tapes were acquired directly from the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> production staff in a series of increments. Some tapes were obtained from storage at the Hoover Press. Additional videotapes were acquired from the Bay Area Video Coalition in San Francisco, California and the PBS Media Library in Alexandria, Virginia in 2009. For the webcast years, video programs are received directly from Stanford Video. Transcripts were captured from various websites by Hoover Archives staff. Transcripts were captured by Hoover Archives staff from the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> website (http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/) and the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine since December 2008.

            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> is a public policy talk show produced by the Hoover Institution. It features Hoover research fellow Peter M. Robinson discussing national and international economic, political, and social issues with political leaders, distinguished scholars, leading journalists, and others. William F. Buckley Jr. designated it as the successor to his television program, 
                <emph render="italic">Firing Line</emph>.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> was broadcast as a weekly half-hour television program from 1996 to June 2005. The first four seasons were broadcast on KTEH-TV, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) affiliate in San Jose, California; beginning with the Winter/Spring 2000 season it was carried by PBS stations throughout the United States. It was also carried internationally by National Public Radio (NPR) Worldwide.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 2006, 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> became an exclusive on the web, offered through National Review Online, FORA.tv, and the Hoover Institution website. The unedited webcasts are typically between 30 and 40 minutes in duration.</p>
            <p>During the broadcast years, each program in the season was assigned a sequential number, and with each new season, the numbering started with the next even hundred:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
                <item>1996: 1-13</item>
                <item>1997: 101-113</item>
                <item>Winter 1998: 201-213</item>
                <item>1998-1999: 301-326</item>
                <item>1999-2000: 401-426</item>
                <item>2000-2001: 501-539</item>
                <item>2001-2002: 601-639</item>
                <item>2002-2003: 701-739</item>
                <item>2003-2004: 801-839</item>
                <item>2004-2005: 901-939</item>
            </list>
            <p>After the program shifted to webcasting, the PBS program numbering was discontinued and Hoover Archives staff assigned each program a sequential number:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
                <item>2006: WUK06 01-04</item>
                <item>2007: WUK07 01-10</item>

            </list>
            <p>Host Peter M. Robinson writes about business and politics, and edits the Hoover Institution's quarterly journal, the 
                <emph render="italic">Hoover Digest</emph>. He has written three books: 
                <emph render="italic">How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life</emph> (Regan Books, 2003); 
                <emph render="italic">It's My Party: A Republican's Messy Love Affair with the GOP</emph> (Warner Books, 2000); and the best-selling business book 
                <emph render="italic">Snapshots from Hell: The Making of an MBA</emph> (Warner Books, 1994; still available in paperback).</p>
            <p>In 1979, he graduated summa cum laude from Dartmouth College, where he majored in English. He went on to study politics, philosophy, and economics at Oxford University, graduating in 1982. Robinson spent six years in the White House, serving from 1982 to 1983 as chief speechwriter to Vice President George H. W. Bush and from 1983 to 1988 as special assistant and speechwriter to President Ronald Reagan. He wrote the historic Berlin Wall address in which President Reagan called on General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to "tear down this wall!"</p>
            <p>After the White House, Robinson attended the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, where the journal he kept formed the basis for 
                <emph render="italic">Snapshots from Hell</emph>. He graduated with an MBA in 1990. He then spent a year in New York City with Fox Television, reporting to the owner of the company, Rupert Murdoch. He spent a second year in Washington, D.C., with the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he served as the director of the Office of Public Affairs, Policy Evaluation, and Research. In 1993, Robinson joined the Hoover Institution.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection includes videorecordings, audio recordings, and transcripts of programs. Most recordings represent edited programs, though a few of the webcasts are unedited. Unedited webcast versions do not have lower third graphics (name/title) nor a Hoover watermark, and have a 4:3 aspect ratio (vs. 16:9 pillarbox for edited shows). Videotape formats in the collection include VHS, Betacam SP, Digital Betacam, one-inch videotape, D3, DVCAM, miniDV, and DVD. Sound recording formats are limited to audio CD. Transcripts are file-based (RTF or PDF).</p>
            <p>Full descriptions of all programs are taken verbatim from the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> website. Dates listed for each program are the date the program was taped. Where the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> web site information differs from the label on a video tape, the label information has been used.</p>
            <p>The two Collections of Programs series consist of programs grouped around particular themes by the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> staff.</p>
            <p>The one-inch videotapes usually contain more than one program per reel. For unidentified programs, the information in the container list is taken from the labels on the videotapes. They may contain clips from multiple programs.</p>
            <p>The Program Transcripts series is not quite complete. Transcripts through 2008 were captured by Hoover Archives staff from the 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> website (
                <extref actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/">http://www.hoover.org/multimedia/uk/</extref>) and the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (
                <extref actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">http://www.archive.org/web/web.php</extref>) from December 2008 to January 2009. When searching the Wayback Machine, the following URLs were used: 
                <extref actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://www-hoover.stanford.edu">http://www-hoover.stanford.edu</extref> and 
                <extref actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://www.hoover.stanford.edu">http://www.hoover.stanford.edu</extref>.</p>
            <p>Because 
                <emph render="italic">Uncommon Knowledge</emph> is an ongoing program, additional material continues to be added to the collection.</p>

How has the status of women in America improved over the past forty years of feminism? As past problems have been solved, have new ones been created? What are the most important issues for the women's movement today? For that matter, just how much do women agree on what it even means to be a feminist?</p>

Genetically modified crops and foods are already big business. But are they safe? Have the giant agribusiness companies that have rushed them into the fields and into our stores overlooked potential dangers posed by genetically engineered crops? Even if scientists do believe these crops are safe, how do they convince a skeptical public?</p>

                            <p>Noted author Tom Wolfe, author and journalist, discusses the latest findings in the field of neuroscience, which Wolfe believes is on the threshold of a unified theory that will have an impact as powerful as that of Darwinism a hundred years ago. Over the past several decades, neuroscientists have been putting together a model of the human brain that suggests that a great deal of our behavior and motivations are hardwired in our brains. In exploring the question of what human nature is, Tom Wolfe makes the connection between this cutting edge and religion, philosophy, and psychology.</p>

                            <p>Joseph McNamara, research fellow, Hoover Institution and John O'Sullivan, media fellow, Hoover Institution and editor-at large, National Review. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph Guiliani created a special police unit to aggressively target street crimes. Their activities included stopping and searching thousands of "suspicious-looking" people on the street. Are these actions necessary to clean up the streets, or are they unnecessarily confrontational and even racist? Has Mayor Guiliani's zero tolerance approach to street crime been responsible for the dramatic reductions in crime in the city, or have his policies done more harm than good? What lessons should the rest of the nation learn from New York?</p>

In the last decade, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have come to dominate the health care system, in part because they promised to contain soaring health care costs. But patients are unhappy with reduced treatment options and doctors are unhappy with reduced payments. Will the Patients Bill of Rights passed by Congress in 1999 solve these problems? Are there more fundamental problems with our health care system that will require more far-reaching solutions?</p>

It's been nearly a decade since Boris Yeltsin brought seventy years of Soviet rule to an end in 1991. Unfortunately, an era that began with high hopes for the new Russia has become a nightmare for the Russian people. One indicator of the troubles in Russia: life expectancy is now lower than during the Soviet era. What went wrong in Russia under Yeltsin? What does the future hold now that Russia has a new leader? Finally, what direction should U.S. relations with Russia take in the next decade?</p>

Following the model of the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals after World War II, the ICC would hold individuals responsible for their roles in grave human rights violations, war crimes, and genocide. Why was the United States one of only seven nations to vote against the ICC? Does the ICC go against American principles of international law or is the United States trying to hold itself above the law? What is the risk that American leaders will be tried before the court?</p>

Like earlier revolutions in health care, such as surgery with anesthesia or the use of antibiotics, genetic engineering has the potential to greatly advance the health and well-being of mankind. Yet unlike earlier innovations, human genetic engineering raises serious ethical questions. It may be one thing for an adult to undergo gene therapy to cure a disease, but what about modifying human embryos to prevent that disease? And if embryos can be altered to improve health, what about to improve intelligence or to select physical characteristics such as hair or eye color?</p>

Does the WTO threaten environmental laws, human rights, and national sovereignty or does it provide the best framework for ensuring that all nations benefit from international trade? Were the protests aimed at the WTO in particular or at the concept of free trade itself?</p>

Wester, auxiliary bishop, Archdiocese of San Francisco. Since 1995, more than forty city and county governments across the country have enacted living wage ordinances. What are living wage ordinances and how does the living wage differ from the minimum wage? Is a living wage ordinance the best way to help low-income families or are there more effective methods of helping those in need?</p>

For decades the United States, the former Soviet Union, China, Britain, and France were the world's only nuclear powers. But that is changing. When India and Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998, they demonstrated that they had both the ability and the will to build nuclear weapons. Is the United States doing enough to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons? Are we prepared for the very real possibility that nations such as North Korea and Iran may soon be able to build nuclear weapons?</p>

                            <p>Sam Jordan, director, program to abolish the death penalty, Amnesty International, USA, and Kent Scheidegger, legal director, Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. Is America on the wrong side of the death penalty debate? The worldwide trend is against the death penalty: more than half the countries in the world have abolished it, including more than 30 nations since 1990. So why do we have a death penalty in America? Is it to deter people from committing murder? If so, does it work? Or is the death penalty fundamentally a matter of justice, of punishing appropriately those guilty of the worst crimes?</p>

                            <p>Milton Friedman, senior research fellow, Hoover Institution and Nobel laureate in economics. Internet technologies are transforming the way we communicate and do business. But, are we, as some claim, in the midst of the "long boom," a new era of unparalleled prosperity driven by unprecedented technological change or are we merely enjoying a bull market that has yet to begin its inevitable correction? What does the current economic boom have in common with the "Roaring Twenties" and how can we avoid an economic contraction as severe as the great depression?</p>

                            <p>Milton Friedman, senior research fellow, Hoover Institution and Nobel laureate in economics. What the next president decides to do with the federal budget will impact the lives of each and every one of us. For example, what should the next president do with the current budget surplus, pay down the national debt, set aside money to strengthen social security, or cut taxes? Milton Friedman answers these questions as well as addresses how the next president should approach the issues of education, health care, and the future of social security.</p>

The House of Representatives is a venerable institution, now more than 200 years old. Is the structure of the institution itself appropriate to the demands of our modern, rapidly changing democracy? What reforms did Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress of 1994 make to the House? Were his reforms just partisan fix-it jobs or were they much-needed repairs for the long-term? Is it even possible to make long-term changes to the House?</p>

In the 2000 presidential campaign, Gore and Bush locked up their nominations almost six months before their parties' conventions. The Democratic and Republican national conventions, formerly full of high-stakes drama as the party delegates chose their presidential tickets, are now little more than formalities. Is the presidential primary system in need of reform or is it working just fine? Does the front-loading of the primary season make it impossible for a dark horse candidate to build a campaign? Do the political parties have too much power in the process or not enough?</p>

The traditional notion of marriage, that of a union between one man and one woman, goes back thousands of years in cultures from around the world. But at the beginning of the 21st century, a debate is building in this country over the definition of marriage, specifically over the issue of same sex marriage. Are two men, or two women, in a committed relationship entitled to the sanctions and legal benefits of marriage? What roles will popular sentiment and judicial activism have in the struggle to redefine marriage?</p>

In 1937, thousands of Americans from all walks of life volunteered to fight in a poorly equipped army overseas, with no support from their government. What was it about the Spanish Civil War that inspired such idealism and courage? And was the fight to defend the Spanish Republic against General Franco and the power of international fascism as pure and noble as it seemed to these Americans? We examine the role that Soviet aid and influence, under Stalin's direction, played in supporting or undermining the republican cause.</p>

For much of the one hundred years just past, the forces of freedom and democracy found themselves at war with two books, Das Kapital, by Karl Marx, which, of course, gave rise to Communism, and Mein Kampf, by Adolph Hitler, which gave rise to Nazism. Nazism and communism, how is it that these two totalitarian ideologies gained such a hold on tens of millions of people? If you had to decide the matter as a historical question, which one, Nazism or communism, did more damage to the fabric of our civilization?</p>

In 1965, Congress established the National Endowment for the Arts, declaring that it was "necessary and appropriate" for the government to fund the arts. We examine the question of whether the NEA really is "necessary and appropriate." What are the consequences of government awarding money to individual artists? What role does the NEA play in arts education? In short, has the NEA been a success or not?</p>

Charter schools are public schools that are allowed to operate outside the normal education bureaucracy. Do charter schools work? We examine this growing movement and look at the evidence: do charter schools outperform normal public schools? If so, why? Who goes to charter schools? And what happens when for profit companies run charter schools?</p>

Spurred in part by a congressional act which allowed universities to patent the results of federally-funded research, corporate contributions to academic research programs grew from $850 million in 1985 to over $4 billion by the early 1990s. In return corporations receive licenses to the patents generated by that research. Do these new academic-corporate relationships threaten the traditional functions of our universities to educate and to serve the public good by bringing the fruits of research to the public sooner and more efficiently?</p>

Congress is considering legislation that establishes a legal right to internet privacy. Many feel, however, that the issue is already settled and that it is impossible to guarantee privacy on the net. How is our privacy compromised when we surf the web? How is the internet industry responding to demands for privacy? Can individuals protect their own privacy online or is government regulation needed?</p>

It is estimated that Colombia produces 90 percent of the cocaine and 65 percent of the heroin consumed in the United States. In July of 2000, with bipartisan support, President Clinton signed a $1.3 billion aid package for Colombia to help that country with its war on drugs. The package includes providing the Colombian army with military helicopters and U.S. military advisors. Will the aid package succeed in stemming the flow of drugs from Colombia, or will it entangle the United States in Colombia's bloody civil war? Will American soldiers lose their lives fighting the drug war on Colombia? Is this a necessary escalation of our own war on drugs or a bad idea?</p>

Over the past several years, biotechnology companies, in a race to find possible new drugs, have deluged the U.S. Patent Office with tens of thousands of requests for patents on pieces of human DNA. Are gene patents being granted inappropriately, before gene functions are fully understood? Are gene patents encouraging or hindering the progress of medicine and the development of new drugs? Some critics have a broader objection to gene patents, arguing that it is inappropriate to give a company the exclusive right to genetic material that is inside us all. Are gene patents, as they suggest, patents on life?</p>

In 1986, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Reykjavik, Iceland, to discuss nuclear arms control. The American and Russian leaders negotiated boldly, pushing each other far past the limits of previous arms control agreements. Reagan and Gorbachev were soon close to an agreement to eliminate all nuclear weapons. The stopping point: Gorbachev insisted that America's Strategic Defense Initiative, "Star Wars" be scrapped. Reagan refused, and no agreement was reached. What is the legacy of the Reykjavik Summit? Was it a failure, a historic opportunity squandered? Or was it beginning of the end of the cold war?</p>

Does socialism's failure in the United States stem from strategic mistakes made by socialist leaders? Or has socialism always been fundamentally incompatible with American culture?</p>

Is our patent system failing the new information economy?

Can industry resolve intellectual property problems on its own? Should we overhaul the patent system or just the U.S. Patent Office?</p>

McLachlan professor of history, Stanford University and Pulitzer prize winning author, Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War and Sam Tanenhaus, author, Whittaker Chambers: A Biography. For the last half of the twentieth century, the conservative movement in the United States was defined by two prominent doctrines: first, containment of the Soviet Union and second, an effort to roll back the expansion of the federal government that began with the New Deal. With the first adversary out of existence, and the second in retreat, what does American conservatism stand for today? We look back to the roots of the conservative movement, its guiding principles, and its leading proponents, including William F. Buckley, Barry Goldwater, and Ronald Reagan. We look to the future of American conservatism: Will it remain a unified movement or will internal tensions break it apart?</p>

Are peacekeeping missions undertaken by the United Nations a good idea? Is there a difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking? What sort of conflicts should the UN become involved in and which should it avoid? What are the alternatives to UN peacekeeping missions? Why have the number of UN missions increased so dramatically since the beginning of the 1990s?</p>

President Clinton called for connecting every classroom in America to the internet. School districts across the country are spending billions of dollars on computers for the classroom. Will all of this effort pay off or is it misguided? Just how should computers be used in the classroom? Is it possible that computers can actually harm the educational process?</p>

Reed Hopper, principal attorney, Pacific Legal Foundation; and James Strock, former California secretary for environmental protection. Almost everyone agrees on the importance of keeping our air and water pollution-free. But how much are we willing to pay or for what measure of protection? The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been criticized for setting clean air standards without regard for the costs of meeting those standards. Critics of this approach argue that failing to weigh costs and benefits could threaten economic growth, which has its own implications for public health. How should the EPA set its standards? Can cost-benefit analysis lead to standards that are both efficient and effective?</p>

How significant are these changes? What are the prospects of resolving some of Mexico's enduring problems, including political corruption, entrenched poverty, and a state-controlled economy? What challenges will Fox have to overcome to bring Mexico into a new era of prosperity and freedom?</p>

                            <p>Andrew Ferguson, senior editor, Weekly Standard. In 1946 George Orwell wrote a famous essay deploring the decline in the level of modern political discourse. Many would argue that in the following fifty years, the problem has only gotten worse. But why is this the case? Our politicians all have teams of professional speech writers and pollsters, working with focus group data and the latest research to figure out just what the public wants to hear. So why doesn't it work? Why does the political discourse of our modern politicians pale against those of our forefathers?</p>

From the Monroe Doctrine through the Truman Doctrine, from containment to dÃ©tente, the principles behind America's boldest foreign policy initiatives were straightforward and easy to understand. These simple principles told the rest of the world what to expect from the United States and what we expected from the rest of the world. What were the principles behind American foreign policy in the 1990s? Did President Clinton apply those principles rigorously or haphazardly? How can President Bush do better?</p>

In 1996, California began the process of deregulating its electric utilities, a process closely watched nationwide, as twenty-five other states also move toward deregulation. The results thus far in California: a power crisis--electricity shortages, rolling blackouts, utilities on the verge of bankruptcy, and rising rates for customers. Was utility deregulation just poorly managed in California or are the electric utilities fundamentally different than industries that have benefited from deregulation, such as, airlines and telephone? Will the California power crisis bring the national movement toward energy deregulation to a halt or not?</p>

In 1997, spurred on by mounting pressure from the scientific community concerned with global warming, representatives of over 170 nations met in Kyoto, Japan, and agreed to reduce greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2012. For its part, the United States has insisted on several important changes including counting forests as carbon sinks against CO2 emissions and buying emissions credits from other countries. Are these good ideas or not? What's the best way to implement the Kyoto Protocol and can it be done without serious harm to the U.S. economy?</p>

In the 17th century, the Catholic Church put the astronomer Galileo on trial before the Inquisition for espousing his theory that the earth revolved around the sun. For many, this trial marks the beginning of a long separation between western science and western religion. In the 21st century, is this rift healing, or is there an inherent conflict between religion and science? If so, why? Do the findings of modern science have religious implications? And what does it mean to be both a person of religion and science?</p>

How should we evaluate physician-assisted suicide or futile treatment theory?

Why then do most African-American leaders today support affirmative action, which explicitly judges people on the basis of their race? Does affirmative action help or hurt African-Americans? Why have political ideology and racial identity become so intertwined? How should we address issues such as the education gap and the breakdown of families in the African-American community?</p>

Is it possible that the same danger lurks in the technology of the Internet? Or is cyberspace actually a revolutionary tool of individual freedom, as many have claimed? In other words, is the technology of the Internet inherently libertarian or will new technology turn the internet into a space of government and corporate control?</p>

For most of the twentieth century, the United States Congress relied on two sections of the Constitution, the interstate commerce clause and the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact national regulations on everything from civil rights to air pollution. Since the mid-1990s, however, the Supreme Court has begun striking down congressional legislation based on these two sections of the Constitution. Is this trend Constitutional Revolution in which the Supreme Court is asserting its power at the expense of Congress? Or is the Court reaffirming the principle of federalism and returning to a strict reading of the Constitution?</p>

What can evolutionary science tell us about human behavior? During the past thirty years, biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists have been applying Darwinian concepts, such as natural selection and survival of the fittest, to the study of behavior. Are social characteristics, such as aggression, love, and courtship determined by our evolutionary past and encoded into our genes like physical attributes, such as walking upright or hair color? Are we slaves to our DNA, or does genetic determinism fail to explain fully what it means to be human?"</p>

Behavioral scientists have begun to argue that the findings of evolutionary science should have legal, political, and moral consequences. If behaviors such as procreation, aggression, or homosexuality are determined more by our biology than by our free will, then it is foolish, these scientists argue, to ignore that evidence. Does evolutionary science have any place in public policy? How useful is the knowledge of our biological evolution in determining the values of our legal, social, and political system?</p>

What lessons can be drawn from previous attempts to deal with terrorism? What should we make of the complaints leveled against the United States by terrorist organizations? What will it take to win the war on terrorism and how long will it last?</p>

                            <p>Milton Friedman, senior research fellow, Hoover Institution and Nobel laureate in economic sciences. The September 11 attacks in New York and Washington have already cost America thousands of lives and billions of dollars in damages. But those are only the direct costs. How severe and how lasting will the impact be on our economy as a whole? And how will new burdens on the federal government, including a military buildup and a bailout of the airline industry, affect fiscal policy? Should the government cut taxes or increase spending to get the economy moving again?</p>

How should the use of force be applied in an era of competing demands from the public, domestic political leaders, and international allies? Did this war prove that the United States can rely on technology to apply force without casualties, or did it prove that ground troops, now as ever, are critical to achieving military objectives?</p>

                            <p>Robert S. McNamara, U.S. secretary of defense, 1961-1968, and coauthor, Wilson's Ghost. More than eighty years ago, President Woodrow Wilson presided over the U.S. entry into the First World War, promising that it would be "the war to end all war." Wilson promoted "peace without victory" and the creation of a League of Nations with the power to enforce the peace thereafter. At that time, Wilson's vision was dismissed by European and American leaders alike as naive idealism. Today, however, Robert S. McNamara, former U.S. secretary of defense, believes that Wilson's vision is essential to reducing the risk of conflict and war in the twenty-first century.</p>

In 1936, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won reelection to a second term in one of the biggest landslides in American history. The outcome was a clear mandate in support of FDR's New Deal: an agenda of large-scale social and economic programs administered by the federal government. Sixty years later, in 1996, William Jefferson Clinton also won reelection to a second term, after declaring earlier that year that "the era of big government was over." How did the Democratic Party get from FDR to Bill Clinton? Now that the Democrats are out of the White House, will they continue the move to the center that Clinton initiated, or will they try to invigorate the traditional liberal base of the Democratic Party? Does that traditional base still exist?</p>

Is nuclear power making a comeback? More than twenty years after the accident at Three Mile Island and fifteen years after the reactor explosion at Chernobyl, the image of nuclear power seems to be changing once again. President Bush has included nuclear energy as part of his national energy plan. The nuclear industry has begun to promote nuclear energy as the clean energy alternative. And a recent poll showed that almost 60 percent of Californians favor nuclear power. So just how safe is nuclear power today? Does it make economic sense to start building new nuclear plants? And what do we do with the radioactive waste?</p>

In recent years a movement has been calling for the United States government to pay reparations for slavery in America. What does the federal government owe the descendants of slaves in this country? Should such reparations be viewed as a gesture of recognition for past wrongs or as an attempt to actually correct those past wrongs? Would payment of reparations erase the lingering economic problems in the African-American community or would they do more harm than good? And if reparations are a good idea, who should receive them, all African Americans or just those descended from slaves?</p>

To what extent are government leaders personally responsible for the outcomes of foreign policy and war? We review the career of Henry Kissinger, one of the most colorful statesmen of the twentieth century. Recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Kissinger served as national security adviser under Presidents Nixon and Ford during two pivotal events in American history, the cold war and the Vietnam War. Is Kissinger guilty, as some have charged, of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his conduct during that era? Or should he be regarded as a bold defender of American freedom during a time of crisis?</p>

Following World War II, Japan reinvented itself both politically, as it adopted the institutions of democratic government, and economically, as it became a dominant producer and exporter of consumer goods. These reforms were so successful that, ten years ago, experts were predicting that Japan would overtake the United States as an economic superpower. Instead, Japan experienced a decade of recession and economic stagnation that continues still. What happened? Is this a sign of serious structural problems in Japan's political and economic institutions? In other words, is it time for Japan to reinvent itself once again? If so, how should the United States alter its relationship with a new Japan?</p>

In 1946, in the wake of two world wars that left the continent devastated, Winston Churchill famously declared, "We must build a kind of United States of Europe." But for a continent of 500 million people and several dozen nation states with singular histories, cultures, and identities, how complete and how inclusive can unification be? With the end of the cold war, what is the motivation for continuing on the path toward union? If we are on the threshold of an actual "United States of Europe," what role will, and should, the United States of America have in this new Europe?</p>

The presidential election of 2000 highlighted the significant demographic divisions between the Democratic Party and Republican Party. The strength of the Republicans lies in the south and in the middle of the country. But the voters that carried those regions for George W. Bush, mostly white and Protestant, are shrinking as a proportion of the overall United States population. Are these demographic changes a serious problem for the Republicans? If so, what can they do to bring groups that have traditionally been democratic: Hispanics, blacks, and Catholics, for example, into the Republican Party?</p>

What is the proper role of the intellectual in public life? Plato believed that philosophers should govern society. He founded his famous academy with the hope of creating such philosopher kings. Another philosopher, Immanuel Kant, however, believed that "the possession of power unavoidably spoils the free use of reason." Therefore, he argued that intellectuals should keep a proper distance from the political realm. Who is right, Kant or Plato?</p>

For instance, what is the connection between depictions of violence in films and on television and the incidence violence in real life?

With the arrival of anthrax letters in Washington, New York, and Florida in the fall of 2001, the often ignored threat of bioterrorism became a very frightening reality, causing illness and death and costing billions of dollars. How has this attack changed our assessment of the threat of biological and chemical weapons? What can and should be done to detect and control these weapons and defend ourselves against future attacks?</p>

On December 12, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States brought an end to thirty-six days of dramatic vote recounts and legal challenges in the state of Florida. The decision let stand the initial results of Florida's election, which gave the state's electoral votes, and thus the presidency, to George W. Bush. What was the legal justification for the Supreme Court's decision? Should the court have intervened in the first place? And what precedent did the court create for future elections?</p>

In August of 2001, President Bush announced his decision to limit federal funding of stem cell research to already established lines of embryonic stem cells, while forbidding funding for any research that required the destruction of additional human embryos. But his decision ended neither stem cell research nor the debate over the ethics of such research. How do we weigh the medical benefits of this research against the destruction of embryos? Where do we draw the line on research using human embryos? Are we on a slippery slope toward even more controversial research?</p>

After two decades of reform, Stalin and Mao wouldn't recognize Russia and China today. But each state has taken a different path away from their communist past. Russia has emphasized democratic reforms while enduring economic instability. China has promoted economic growth based on market reforms, while maintaining tight control over politics. Which path will prove to be more successful, Russia's or China's?</p>

                            <p>Bruce Barlett, senior fellow, National Center for Policy Analysis and Peter Orszag, senior fellow, Brookings Institution. How much does the gap between rich and poor matter? In 1979, for every dollar the poorest fifth of the American population earned, the richest fifth earned nine. By 1997, that gap had increased to fifteen to one. Is this growing income inequality a serious problem? Is the size of the gap between rich and poor less important than the poor absolute level of income? In other words, should we focus on reducing the income gap or on fighting poverty?</p>

In 1996, a Republican Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, better known as welfare reform. The act replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program (AFDC) with the Temporary Aid to Needy Families Program (TANF). These changes effectively refocused welfare as job training and temporary assistance and moved millions of people off the welfare rolls. With TANF up for reauthorization by Congress in 2002, the debate over the first five years of welfare reform is heating up. Has welfare reform helped poor families and reduced child poverty? Does welfare reform itself need to be reformed?</p>

Should property owners be compensated for the effects of government regulation? According to the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, "No person shall...be deprived of...property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." But what exactly is a property right and what constitutes a taking? Seizure of land by the government may be a taking, but what about environmental or zoning regulations that place restrictions on land use? With one such taking case already before the Supreme Court, the legal battle over these questions could alter the very nature of the relationship between the rights of the individual property owner and those of society as a whole.</p>

In the summer of 2002, the Supreme Court will announce its decision on a Cleveland school voucher case that many are calling the most important case on educational opportunities since Brown v. the Board of Education in 1954. In the Cleveland vouchers program, 96 percent of the participating children use government-funded tuition vouchers to attend religious schools. Is such an arrangement constitutional, or does it violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which has served as the constitutional basis for the separation of church and state? Just how should the Supreme Court rule, and what effects will its ruling have on the future of vouchers in the United States?</p>

                            <p>Williamson Evers, research fellow, Hoover Institution and member, Hoover-Koret Task Force on K-12 education; and Elliot Eisner, professor of education, Stanford University. Will standards-based testing and accountability improve our nation's education system? In January 2002, President Bush signed into law the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2002. The act calls for a mandatory annual test in reading and math for every child in the nation in the third through eighth grades. Schools that fail to improve their students' scores may be held accountable, possibly losing some federal funding. Supporters of the act say that standards-based testing and accountability are the best ways to monitor and improve the nation's schools. Opponents say that such a regime is largely a political ploy that will do more harm than good. Who's right?</p>

Computers more important than humans? Self-replicating molecular robots? Virtual immortality? These may sound like science fiction, but some reputable computer scientists are predicting they will happen within the next several decades. What will our world be like if and when our machines surpass us in our intelligence? Do the advances in biotechnology, robotics, and nanotechnology, which make intelligent machines possible, pose dangers of their own? Should we embrace such a future or try to stop it?</p>

More than 140 years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution is still generating controversy. Although Darwinism is championed by the majority of the scientific community, some have claimed that Darwin's theory is bad science and have put forward their own even more controversial theories. What should we make of these arguments? Is one such theory, known as intelligent design, merely creationism by another name, or is it a legitimate scientific alternative to Darwinism?</p>

Did life on earth unfold by chance or by design? According to the natural sciences and Darwin's theory of evolution, it was by chance. According to the Judeo-Christian tradition, it was by divine design. On this crucial question, science and religion appear to be irreconcilable. But are they? Does Darwinism encourage atheism? Must Christians be anti-Darwin?</p>

In 1965, Congress voted to change the laws that had restricted immigration into the United States for more than four decades. The Immigration Act of 1965 resulted in a wave of increased immigration that continues today. How do recent immigrant groups compare with those of the last great wave of immigration a century ago? Are they successfully integrating into American culture or threatening America's cultural stability? Should immigration once again be restricted, or should we concern ourselves with helping immigrants assimilate when they arrive?</p>

Is America a divided nation? Sharp regional voting patterns were evident in the 2000 presidential election: rural, Midwestern, and southern voters went for Bush; urban and coastal voters went for Gore. These regional voting patterns have led some to describe America as one nation with two cultures. Is this an accurate way of looking at American society? Or is America divided along economic rather than cultural lines? Just how fundamental are these differences and what impact will they have on the American political landscape?</p>

The 2000 census asked Americans to identify themselves according to 126 possible racial and ethnic categories, up from just 5 categories in 1990. Movements are now afoot to add even more racial categories to the 2010 census. Does the Collection of all these data stand in the way of the creation of a truly color blind society? Should we drop questions of race from the census and other government forms? Or are these data critical tools in the ongoing fight to end inequality and discrimination?</p>

Yet the CIA failed to prevent the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. How come? Should the CIA have been able to foresee and prevent this sort of attack? Now that the cold war is over, is it time to abolish the CIA or reform it to respond to the new threat of terrorism? If reform is the answer, should the CIA put more emphasis on high technology or on placing agents on the field?</p>

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Congress passed and President Bush signed the USA Patriot Act--legislation intended to thwart the threat of domestic terrorism. Critics were quick to denounce USA Patriot as a dangerous expansion of government power at the expense of our civil liberties. Are the critics right? Or can we win the war on terrorism without sacrificing our civil liberties here at home? And what has the American experience in earlier crises, such as the Civil War and the two world wars, taught us about balancing national security and personal freedom?</p>

In a 2002 Gallup poll conducted in ten Muslim nations, only 22 percent of the people questioned viewed the United States favorably. Why does the United States foster such hatred in the Islamic world in particular? Is it our foreign policy--our support of Israel and of repressive Arab regimes in the Middle East? Or is it our culture? Does globalization spread American values that are simply antithetical, thus disruptive, to the traditional Islamic view of society? Just what should we do to win this struggle for the hearts and minds of those who despise us around the world?</p>

In his State of the Union speech in January 2002, President Bush promised to spend "whatever it costs to defend our country." That cost, according to Bush's proposed budget, would come to $378 billion in 2003, $48 billion more than in 2002, and the largest percent increase in defense spending since the Reagan era. Critics are saying that the proposed 2003 budget perpetuates the Pentagon's most inefficient weapons and spending habits, thereby delaying the true transformation of the military that is needed to protect America in the twenty-first century. Who's right, the Bush administration or its critics?</p>

Study after study has shown that married people are healthier and wealthier than unmarried people and that children raised in two-parent homes are generally more successful in life than those who aren't. And yet, according to the U.S. census, about half of all first marriages end in divorce. Additionally, since 1960 the percentage of children born out of wedlock has grown from single digits to 20 percent. What is going on? Is the decline in marriage a symptom of underlying cultural problems in modern America? Or is it misguided to focus on marriage rather than on the economic problems facing all low income families, whether married or not?</p>

Just two years ago, in the 2000 fiscal year, the annual federal budget had a surplus of $236 billion. Now the federal government is facing a budget deficit of more than $150 billion, possibly much more. And whereas during the presidential campaign of 2000, the candidates were debating how to spend trillions in expected future surpluses, the Congressional Budget Office is now projecting a cumulative $1 trillion deficit by 2011. What happened to the surplus, and what is to blame for the return of the deficit? Is it President Bush's tax cut? Or was it the recession of 2001 and the war on terrorism? In light of the deficit, what should we make of the President's budget plans?</p>

The Crusades happened almost a thousand years ago: why do they still provoke an argument? Osama Bin Laden has used them to attempt to rally the Islamic world to his cause; President Bush has called the war on terrorism a "crusade." But what is the truth about the crusades? Were they motivated by savage greed and intolerance or by pious idealism? Were they an unprovoked attack by the west on the Islamic world or a reaction to centuries of Islamic incursions? How should we understand the legacy of the crusades today, in a time of conflict between the west and radical Islamic terrorists?</p>

Recent opinion polls show that the American public overwhelmingly wants the United States to avoid taking sides in the conflict in the Middle East. Yet members of Congress have been nearly unanimous in their support of Israel in its actions against the Palestinians. Just why is our government so steadfastly supportive of Israel? Does this support further our legitimate strategic interests in the Middle East? Or is it the result of domestic special interest politics?</p>

The war on terrorism has created unique ideological challenges for both ends of the American political spectrum. Does the left, long opposed to the exercise of U.S. military power, risk irrelevance by opposing the war on terror? How does the libertarian wing of the right, long opposed to big government, respond to its expanding role in protecting our security? How has President Bush's conduct of the war on terrorism affected his chances for reelection in 2004?</p>

What kind of war is the war on terrorism? Ordinarily wars are fought against proper nouns--against Germany during the Second World War or against the Soviet Union during the cold war, for example. Now we're being asked to fight a war against a common noun, terrorism. Just how accurate and useful is the phrase "war on terrorism?" Is this a war? And who exactly is the enemy--Al Qaeda? Al Qaeda plus all other terrorists around the world? Al Qaeda plus all other terrorists plus all the countries in which the terrorists operate? In other words, just how good a job are the president and the administration doing, not just in prosecuting the war but in defining the objectives?</p>

The year will be remembered as a difficult one for the Catholic Church in America. Sex abuse scandals and criticism of the Church's response to those scandals dominated the headlines for months. Sexual abuse is not the only subject creating controversy within Catholic circles. Other divisive matters include the role of women within the Church, gay priests, and the relation of American bishops to the Vatican. Is the Catholic Church in danger of losing its constituency in America? Are substantial reforms in the structure and teachings of the Catholic Church necessary? Or are reforms what got the Church in trouble in the first place?</p>

Throughout the latter half of the Twentieth Century, the United States and Western Europe seemed the staunchest of allies, united in NATO in defense against the common threat of the Soviet Union. With the end of the cold war and the loss of that common enemy, however, signs of emerging tensions have appeared in the friendship between America and Europe. How serious are the spats between Europe and the United States over issues such as the International Criminal Court, the conflict in the Middle East, and the U.S. conduct of the war on terrorism? With the formation of the European Union, Europe has become an economic rival to the United States. Will it become a political and military rival as well?</p>

According to a 1998 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, over the last half century nations that have been more open to trade have experienced double the annual growth rate of those that have been closed. So why would any nation be opposed to free trade? But, in fact, many developing countries are skeptical of free trade--believing that the rules of global trade benefit the rich, developed north at the expense of the poor, developing south. Are the critics right? With even President Bush's commitment appearing to falter, is the drive to greater free trade in crisis?</p>

Ten years ago, soaring health care costs prompted the Clinton administration to propose sweeping reforms to the health care system, including a substantial new role for the federal government. But the plan drafted under the guidance of first lady Hillary Clinton was defeated in Congress. A decade later, the problems with our health care system seem to have only gotten worse. In the recent economic downturn, millions lost their insurance along with their jobs, adding to the estimated 40 to 45 million Americans who have no medical insurance at all. Meanwhile the costs incurred by government and businesses to keep the rest of us covered are skyrocketing. Has the HMO model of health care that became predominant in the 1990s failed us? If so, what should replace it?</p>

For decades, Western Europe has been known for its social democracies: large welfare states governed by a coalition of the political left and center. In recent years, however, this center-left coalition seems to have broken down. Conservative parties have come to power in a number of European countries, including Spain, Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Why has Europe moved to the right? Have a few specific issues, such as immigration and crime, driven European voters to the right? Are voters merely expressing a temporary frustration with the center-left coalition, or is the new conservative Europe here to stay?</p>

In the west, capitalism reigns triumphant. Living standards, wealth, and technological development in the capitalist western countries surpass anything seen before in human history. But why has capitalism so obviously failed in most developing countries? Why are some saying that capitalism is in a state of crisis today in the third world? Does the success of capitalism depend on western cultural values that simply don't translate to the third world? Or can economic and political reforms, especially reform of property rights, enable developing countries to share the same fruits of capitalism and free enterprise that we enjoy in the west?</p>

In 1978, the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla was elected to the papacy of the Catholic Church, taking the name of John Paul II. In the twenty-four years since, Pope John Paul II has traveled more widely and held audiences for more people than any other pope in history. But beyond his long history and high profile, how will John Paul II be remembered? Will he be remembered more for his political impact--many say that he played a crucial role in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe--or for his ecclesiastical work? Just how well has John Paul II prepared the Catholic Church for the twenty-first century?</p>

Does the war on terrorism threaten our civil liberties? Benjamin Franklin famously admonished, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety." Are we today being asked to give up essential liberties for temporary safety? If so, is it worth it? Or are the fears that the government's war on terrorism will trample our freedoms overblown?</p>

The Supreme Court has the final authority on all matters of law under the U.S. Constitution. But what legal philosophy should the Supreme Court use to reach its decisions? Should the Court merely hand down rules based on the text of a fixed, or "dead," Constitution? Or should the Court apply standards that are based on interpretations of a "living" Constitution that evolves as our society changes? These fundamentally different approaches to constitutional law have created a rift with the current Supreme Court. How serious is this rift? Who's right? And to what extent are these competing arguments merely cover for ideological positions?</p>

                            <p>John McCain, Republican senator, Arizona. John McCain has spent a lifetime in the service of his country, including twenty-two years as a naval aviator, two terms in the United States House of Representatives, and service in the United States Senate, since 1986. Following his 2000 presidential campaign and the hard-fought passage of his Campaign Finance Bill, John McCain reflects on a life in politics in his recent memoir, Worth the Fighting For. A lifelong Republican, Senator McCain has broken with his party's mainstream on a number of issues in recent years. Does John McCain still consider himself a conservative? And why does McCain so often play the maverick?</p>

Cloning, using biotechnology to create embryos with specific genetic information, identical to other embryos or even human adults, used to sound like science fiction. Today, however, the ability to successfully clone human embryos is a matter of when, not if. But should human cloning be allowed to go forward? Is cloning morally wrong, in and of itself? Should we make a distinction between cloning for medical research and cloning for procreation? If cloning is morally wrong, could we stop it even if we wanted to? And if cloning isn't or can't be banned, how should it be regulated?</p>

It's been more than 25 years since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. For most of that time, the number of executions in this country climbed steadily higher. In the past several years, however, the death penalty has come under increasing criticism. Executions have fallen nationwide from a high of 98 in 1998 to 66 in 2001. Two states, Illinois and Maryland, declared moratoria on the death penalty over concerns that the death penalty could not be administered fairly. Is the death penalty immoral in and of itself? If not, is it unconstitutional? What is required to ensure that the death penalty is administered with fairness, justice, and accuracy?</p>

Global warming, population, deforestation, mass extinctions--according to environmental groups and environmental scientists, the earth is in ever more dire straits. Should we heed these warnings and take steps to mitigate our impact on the global ecosystem? Danish statistician BjÃ¸rn Lomborg has come forward to say, not so fast. He claims the environmental state of the world is actually improving, not getting worse. His claims have generated a firestorm of condemnation in the scientific community. Why? And how can we in the general public separate ideology from fact in this debate?</p>

Did Ronald Reagan win the cold war? It's been a dozen years since its end--time enough to look back on the era with some historical perspective. And one question that historians continue to argue about is the role that Ronald Reagan, the man and his policies, played in bringing the cold war to an end. To what extent did Reagan's cold war strategy build on efforts of previous administrations and to what extent was it new? Did the Soviet Union collapse as a result of external pressure or internal weakness?</p>

In the past century the earth's human population has quadrupled, growing from 1.5 billion in 1900 to about 6 billion today. By 2050, it is estimated that the global population will reach 9 billion. In 1968, a young biologist named Paul Ehrlich wrote a best selling book called The Population Bomb, which sparked an ongoing debate about the dangers of overpopulation. He argued that population growth was destroying the ecological systems necessary to sustain life. So just how worried should we be? Is population growth a problem or not? And if so, what should we do about it?</p>

In September 2002, President Bush released the first national security strategy report of his administration. Crafted by the President, his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and a team of experts both inside and outside the government, the report lays out what some have called "the most important reformulation of U.S. grand strategy in more than half a century." Proponents say that the national security strategy presents the case for the responsible and justified use of American power, but critics call it a dangerous "doctrine without limits." Who's right?</p>

In January 2003, the Bush administration unveiled a package of proposed new tax cuts, including provisions to eliminate the taxation of dividends and make permanent the 2001 tax cut. President Bush called the plan "an immediate boost to the economy" as well as "essential for the long run to lay the groundwork for future growth and prosperity." Critics have said that the plan doesn't provide short term economic stimulus and endangers long term growth and prosperity. Is the Bush tax plan good for the economy or not?</p>

In the modern democratic era, it's not uncommon for elected leaders to have little or no military training or experience. It has become an accepted notion that political leaders should therefore leave battle plans and campaign decisions to the military commanders and avoid micromanaging war. But is that notion correct? Or was Clemenceau right when he said that "war is too important to be left to the generals?" What lessons can we learn from studying the greatest wartime leaders, such as Lincoln, Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt?</p>

Since the end of the cold war, the world has watched as the United States became, not merely the world's only superpower, but what the French began calling a "hyperpower." Now with the United States asserting its will and power on such issues as Iraq and the war on terror while rejecting constraints that the international community tries to place on it, some suggest that the term American empire is more appropriate. If America does have an empire, it is not based on territorial expansion as in past empires. So what is it based on? And would taking on the role of imperial hegemony be good for America and the world?</p>

A case currently before the Supreme Court challenges the constitutionality of the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law, which in 1974 legalized heterosexual sodomy but not same-sex sodomy. Does the Texas law violate the constitutional rights of homosexuals, or are states permitted to pass such laws if they choose? If the Supreme Court does strike down the Texas law, what implications will that have for other civil rights that gays and lesbians are seeking, such as same-sex marriage?</p>

Kmiec, dean and St. Thomas More professor of law, Columbus School of Law, Catholic University of America. The Supreme Court will soon announce its decisions on two cases that are being called the most important for affirmative action in a quarter century. These cases both challenge the use of racial preferences in the admissions policies at the University of Michigan. On one side of the legal dispute over the Michigan policies are those who argue that creating racial diversity on college campuses is a compelling interest that justifies the use of certain types of racial preferences in the admissions process. On the other side are those who argue that any system that rewards people solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional. Who's right? And how will the Supreme Court's decision affect the future of affirmative action?</p>

Over the past year, the clashes between the Bush administration and European leaders over the best way to handle Saddam Hussein have led many observers to suggest that the half-century-long alliance between Western Europe and the United States is dead. How serious is the rift between Europe and America, and why has it emerged? Is it still in the strategic interest of the United States to maintain tens of thousands of troops in Europe, or should we pull out of NATO altogether?</p>

Sofaer, George P. Shultz senior fellow, Hoover Institution. Is Saudi Arabia an ally or an adversary? Saudi Arabia remains an autocratic monarchy, where the rights of women and the press are severely restricted. Saudi money is a principal source of funding for the Wahhabi sect, which promotes a militant form of Islam throughout the Muslim world. Osama bin Laden and fifteen of the nineteen participants in the attacks of September 11 came from Saudi Arabia. And yet, for more than 50 years, the United States has treated Saudi Arabia as an ally. Why? What role have Saudi oil and Saudi oil money played in shaping our relationship? Is it time to recognize that Saudi Arabia may threaten American national interests? If so, what should U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia be?</p>

Is the culture of the west, the line of cultural tradition that connects modern America and Europe with ancient Greece and Rome, particularly lethal in war? Victor Davis Hanson contends that, from the time of the Greeks on, western culture has created the deadliest soldiers in the history of civilization. What is it about the western tradition that has so often led to victory on the battlefield over non-Western armies? What does this tradition mean for the battles that America will face in the future?</p>

It has been nearly twenty- five years since the Shah of Iran was overthrown in a popular revolution. The ensuing American hostage crisis marked the beginning of an era of mutual hostility between Iran and the United States--Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini often called the United States "the Great Satan"; more recently President Bush placed Iran on the so-called axis of evil. But an increasingly visible democratic reform movement supported by young Iranians born after the revolution suggests that Iran may be entering a new era of change. Just how powerful is the reform movement in Iran? And what should the United States do, if anything, to help bring about a new Iran?</p>

The past decade has seen the emergence of an increasingly vocal animal rights movement in this country. Although many of the specific goals of the movement have to do with promoting the humane treatment of animals, the underlying argument is that certain basic legal rights should be extended to animals as well. Should we recognize that animals have legal rights, or should we continue to regard animals as property, as resources to use as humans see fit? Just what rights, if any, should animals have? And how could these rights alter the relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom?</p>

In 1998, India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons, becoming the first new nations in three decades to join the club of nuclear powers. Today other nations, such as North Korea and Iran, are on verge of doing so as well. Why is the nonproliferation regime, which seemed to work well for so many years, failing now? Has the Bush administration's response to the new dangers of proliferation been appropriate, or will it make the danger worse?</p>

Conservative: favoring traditional values; tending to oppose change. But is the definition of a conservative changing in twentieth-century America? Today conservatives seem to be divided into two groups, the neoconservatives and those who view themselves as traditional conservatives-- sometimes derisively called the "paleoconservatives." Are the neoconservatives, including many in the Bush administration, actually, as some charge, radicals in conservative clothing? Or have the paleoconservatives become too hidebound for their own good?</p>

Is democracy--that is, free elections--to be desired at all times for all nations? Or are nations more successful when they establish the rule of law, property rights, and other constitutional liberties first? For the United States, this is no longer an academic question. America is deeply involved in nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq. Should the establishment of democracy in these countries be the first priority for the United States, or is securing public order and the rule of law more important?</p>

Fifty years ago, critic Lionel Trilling declared that "in the United States at this time, liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition." Today, however, even most Democrats avoid calling themselves liberal. What happened to the liberal tradition in the second half of the 20th century? What does liberalism stand for at the beginning of the 21st century? Can liberals reclaim their once dominant position in American politics or is their ideology history?</p>

In 2001, President Bush established a bipartisan commission to study and report recommendations for restoring fiscal soundness to the current Social Security program. All three of the commission's models for reforming the system include the creation of individually controlled retirement accounts--a process commonly referred to as "privatizing Social Security." Some critics of the proposals argue that Social Security is not in as much trouble as the president's commission would have us believe and that major reform is unnecessary. Other critics say that creating private accounts will compound Social Security's problems rather than solve them. Who's right, the president's commission or its critics?</p>

On October 7, 2003, Californians go to the polls to vote in an historical election. They will decide whether to recall Governor Gray Davis and replace him with someone else. Davis is only the second governor in U.S. history to face a recall election. Is the California recall in the best interests of its citizens? Or is the recall election an example of direct democracy gone awry? And what long-term effects will this recall campaign have on politics at both the state and national levels?</p>

In March of 2002, President Bush signed into law the bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, better known as the McCain-Feingold Bill. The law banned political contributions known as "soft money"--that is, money from corporations, unions, and other organizations which was given to political parties for "party-building activities," thereby skirting campaign contributions limits. The Supreme Court has now taken up the McCain-Feingold Act and will determine whether all or parts of the act will be upheld or overturned. Are soft money bans legal? Or do such campaign finance restrictions infringe on freedom of speech? Just how should the Court decide?</p>

There are often said to be two competing schools for interpreting the meaning of the Constitution. On one side are those who believe that the meaning of the Constitution must evolve over time as society itself changes. On the other side are those who insist that the original intent of the framers of the Constitution--what they wrote and what their intent was in writing it--is all that matters. Robert Bork is firmly in the latter school. We asked him to explicate his understanding of the U.S. Constitution, using recent Supreme Court decisions as case studies.</p>

Why does the European Union even need a constitution? Will the constitution limit the powers of the Union over the member countries, or does it mean the creation of a European superstate? Should the constitution be ratified, or is it just a colossal mistake?</p>

                            <p>Paul Johnson, historian and author, Modern Times. Can America become an "empire for liberty"? British historian Paul Johnson believes that it can and should. The United States, he argues, is uniquely suited, due to both its principles and its current power, to bring about benevolent change throughout the world. But does empire suit the United States? We ask Johnson just how and why America can be this "empire for liberty" and to place American materialism in its historical context.</p>

In his first term, President George W. Bush has had difficulty getting his nominees to the federal courts of appeal confirmed by the Senate. The Democrats have taken the almost unprecedented step of threatening filibusters to prevent floor votes on certain nominees. Has the judicial appointments process become the latest victim of bitter partisan politics? Or has the judiciary brought this state of affairs upon itself by advancing a doctrine of judicial supremacy, leaving the executive and legislative branches no choice but to resort to political litmus tests for nominees? What does this situation bode for the next Supreme Court nomination? And what, if anything, should be done to reform the process?</p>

For more than thirty years, the United States has been waging a war on drugs. This war--which takes the form of billions of dollars spent each year on drug law enforcement and interdiction, as well as harsh sentencing for drug offenses--is being called a failure by many critics. But if it is a failure, is drug legalization the solution? Just how would legalization work? And would the benefits of legalization outweigh the costs?</p>

Should gay marriage be granted legal recognition? Are same-sex couples who are not allowed to marry under current law being denied the equal protection of law? How would recognition of gay marriage alter the traditional purpose of marriage? And would gay marriage erode support for families or strengthen it?</p>

How is Mexican immigration changing the United States in the twenty-first century?

What is the economic and social impact of this influx on California, and what does it bode for the rest of the country? What makes Mexican immigration different than immigration from other countries?

In 2003 April, North Korean officials admitted for the first time that their nation possessed the ability to build nuclear weapons. Many experts suggest that the possible possession of nuclear weapons by a so-called rogue state such as North Korea sets the stage for far more serious conflict than the war with Iraq. Just how should the United States try to diffuse the Korean crisis? Can diplomatic efforts succeed where they have previously failed? Will the United States have to consider military options? And just what is North Korea hoping to accomplish by fomenting this crisis?</p>

The law is intended to prevent future terrorist acts by enhancing various law enforcing tools. Critics argue that the Patriot Act is a dangerous infringement on American civil liberties. Now, more than two years after the passage of the Patriot Act, do we have any evidence that the critics are right? For that matter, do we even know whether the Patriot Act is working to deter terrorism? Should the Patriot Act be allowed to expire, or should its provisions become a permanent part of the war on terrorism?</p>

How do America's unique historical circumstances predispose it to handle the unrivaled power it holds in the world today? And what lessons can we draw from our nearest historical antecedent, the British Empire of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries?</p>

Admirers and critics have two diametrically opposed views of President George W. Bush. The admirers see a compassionate conservative at home and defender of the nation against terrorism and rogue states abroad. Critics see a radical conservative at home who led the nation into a destructive and unnecessary war abroad. Why do conservatives and liberals so often seem to be describing two different men when discussing President George W. Bush? Is it possible to find any common ground on which view of President Bush is closer to the truth?</p>

Did the framers of the United States Constitution intend that the Supreme Court be the sole and final interpreter of the Constitution, with the power to place binding decisions on the executive and legislative branches? Or did they intend that the Supreme Court have the final say only on the legal cases that came before it, thus permitting the executive and legislative branches to have wide latitude in interpreting the Constitution for themselves? The former view, that of judicial supremacy, is the dominant view of the Supreme Court today, accepted, for the most part, both within government and in society more generally. Is this view supported by the Constitution? If not, why and when did it arise? Should we support judicial supremacy, or is it time to rein in the Supreme Court?</p>

Building America's electricity system was one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, providing inexpensive energy to homes and businesses throughout the country. But in the twenty-first century, two crises occurred. In 2001, California experienced massive electricity shortages, leading to rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electric bills. And in 2003, a blackout swept across eight states in the Midwest and Northeast, leaving tens of millions in the dark. Why did these problems arise now, after a century of progress? Were they the result of ill-advised attempts to deregulate the utility industry? Or is more deregulation actually the solution?</p>

The spread of democracy around the world was one of the most significant developments of the twentieth century. At the beginning of the last century, democracy was limited to a handful of western nations, while today perhaps 120 nations have some form of democratic government. Yet among Muslim countries, democracy is rare, and among Arab states, essentially nonexistent. Why? Is the Islamic faith compatible with the essential features of a democratic society--separation of church and state, freedom of expression, and women's rights, to name a few--or not? Just what is the future of democracy in the Arab world?</p>

On March 14, 2004, Russians head to the polls to choose a president. Current president Vladimir Putin is expected to win a second term by an overwhelming margin. Will this be a genuine democratic show of support for a popular leader or the result of a corrupt political system headed towards dictatorship? When president Bush first met president Putin in June 2001, he declared, "I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy.... I was able to get a sense of his soul." Is Putin the trustworthy leader that Bush saw or something much more dangerous?</p>

The decades of the 1980s and 1990s seem to offer two different fiscal models for promoting economic growth. The 1980s under President Reagan suggest that cutting taxes is more important than balancing the budget. The 1990s under President Clinton suggest the importance of balancing the budget with moderate tax increases. Yet the results in each decade were similar: sustained economic growth. President George W. Bush has clearly been following the Reagan model in his first term, enacting large tax cuts even as the federal budget approaches record deficits. But has the Bush team taken the correct lessons from our recent economic past? Do the Bush policies promote long-term growth or jeopardize it?</p>

The Prussian military historian Carl von Clausewitz famously observed that "war is merely a continuation of politics by other means." These "other" (violent) means have been used on countless occasions throughout human history to settle conflicts over lands, resources, and political rule. But what is the utility of war in the modern world? In a world with weapons of mass destruction, have the means of war delegitimized its use? In a world of expanding democracy and cultural and economic interdependence, has the use of force become outdated?</p>

When the Constitution of the United States was ratified in 1789, the infamous "three-fifths clause" gave the southern slaveholding states disproportionate power within the federal government. To what extent did this southern advantage help the southerner Thomas Jefferson win the presidency? And to what extent did Jefferson, author of the phrase "all men are created equal," use the power of his presidency to preserve and perpetuate the institution of slavery?</p>

From the 1950s to the 1980s, Japan experienced dramatic economic growth as it transformed itself from a defeated militaristic empire into a democratic high-technology powerhouse. The Japanese economy became so dynamic that, by the late 1980s, some American experts were arguing that Japan would overtake the United States as the world's dominant economic power. And then the Japanese economy collapsed. And for nearly fifteen years, the economic malaise has continued. Why? What does Japan need to do to snap out of its doldrums? And what are the risks and benefits to American interests of a reinvigorated Japan?</p>

Irmas professor of public interest law, legal ethics and political science, University of Southern California; and John Yoo, professor of law, University of California, Berkeley. Do enemy combatants in the war on terror have any legal rights? The United States now holds more than 650 persons captured during the war on terrorism at our naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba. The government is holding them indefinitely, without charging them and without offering them access to American courts or legal counsel. Is this legal? Do federal courts have jurisdiction in this matter, or do these detainees exist completely outside of the American legal system?</p>

Is the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional? The original pledge, written in 1892 by the Christian socialist Francis Bellamy, did not contain the words "under God." Congress added these two words in 1954. And it is these words that caused the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to rule in June 2002 that recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools violated the First Amendment's so-called separation of church and state. Now the case is before the Supreme Court. Will the court rule that reciting the current pledge in schools is okay, or do the words "under God" have to go?</p>

It is estimated that currently there are between 7 and 10 million illegal immigrants in this country. Meanwhile the Border Patrol has grown from a staff of 2,000 and a $100 million budget 30 years ago to 11,000 men and women and a $9 billion budget today. Clearly, our attempts to control illegal immigration have not been working. But what should we do instead? President George W. Bush has proposed a new immigration plan that would turn illegal immigrants already here into legal temporary workers. Is his plan an acknowledgment that our economy needs cheap immigrant labor and that we simply can't control our borders any longer? Or is his plan the entirely wrong way to address the immigration problem?</p>

Of the 6 billion people on earth, 1 billion--primarily in North America, Europe, and East Asia--receive 80 percent of the global income. Meanwhile 1 billion people subsist on less than one dollar a day. Despite billions in development aid, many Third World nations are no better off than they were half a century ago. Why are developing countries still so poor? And what can international development agencies such as the World Bank do to help?</p>

On July 1, the Coalition Provisional Authority--the body headed by U.S. ambassador Paul Bremer that has governed Iraq since the end of the Iraq War--will transfer sovereignty to a temporary Iraqi government. The transfer of power raises a number of hard questions. Will our attempts at nation building in this ethnically and religiously divided country succeed? Just what are our responsibilities in ensuring that success? And how long will or should the United States maintain a military presence in Iraq?</p>

And if American workers are being harmed by outsourcing, what should be done about it? Do we need legislation to prevent corporations from sending jobs overseas? Or should we focus our attention on creating new opportunities for the American labor force through education and job training?</p>

During the past decade, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have been able to capture a majority of the vote in national elections. In fact, the country hasn't been so evenly divided since the 1870s. Some say this is evidence of a culture war and a political divide that has split the country into two Americas. Others disagree, arguing that in fact most Americans are in the moderate middle and are divided on relatively few issues. Who's right?</p>

In the United States, affirmative action policies, first implemented to address the historical grievances of black Americans, have long been controversial. But the debate over affirmative action has generally ignored such action as practiced by other countries around the world. Has affirmative action proven to be more or less effective in other countries? What common patterns do these programs share? How can the study of these programs help our understanding of affirmative action in America?</p>

                            <p>Carl Pope, executive director, Sierra Club; and Fred Smith, Jr., president and founder, Competitive Enterprise Institute. This past summer's big-budget disaster movie, The Day after Tomorrow, depicted a near-future in which human-caused global warming dramatically disrupted the earth's climate system, plunging the world in a new ice age. Although the scenario in the film is clearly an unrealistic fantasy, some scientists say that relatively sudden climate change is theoretically possible. But how likely it is depends on whether human activity really causes global warming. Does the evidence suggest that higher amounts of so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel consumption are, in fact, causing global warming? And if so, what should we do about it?</p>

More than fifty years after the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education, there is still an unacceptable gap between the academic achievements of white and black students in America. In fact, by some standards, black students today perform more poorly than they did fifteen years ago. Why? What role does culture play? Does culture explain the disparate performance of Hispanic and Asian students? And just how should we go about trying to close this gap?</p>

A half-century ago, the ideology of the American political establishment was liberal--the New Deal was still new and big government was getting bigger. Today, after a political revolution that began with Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, it may be argued that conservatism has become the dominant ideological force in American politics.

If so, what can be done to revitalize NASA and restore both its sense of purpose and the public's excitement for space exploration that has been missing for twenty years?</p>

Since then, although stifling political dissent, China has continued to liberalize its economy and is rapidly becoming an economic superpower. Will the explosion of new wealth in China lead to new pressures for democratic reform? And just what is the legacy of Tiananmen?</p>

The global AIDS pandemic is now in its third decade. Although treatments have improved and infection rates have slowed in the West, AIDS continues to take a staggering toll in Africa. And experts believe that Eurasia, particularly Russia, China, and India, may be next. Is the United States doing enough to combat the global AIDS crisis? Should the United States continue its current policy, which includes an emphasis on getting antiretroviral drugs to millions who can't now afford them? Or does the United States need to focus more on pressuring affected countries to reform their inadequate social and economic institutions?</p>

                            <p>Before September 11, we took it for granted that only nations or states could wage war on the United States. After 9/11 it became obvious that war could also be waged by terrorists operating anonymously and in the shadows. Are the laws of war-the Geneva Conventions, the International Convention on Torture-suited to this new reality of war? Whom may we detain? How may we interrogate those we detain? In the war on terror, do the laws of war permit us to be as tough as we need to be? Peter Robinson speaks with Peter Berkowitz and Jenny Martinez.</p>

                            <p>In the last decade and a half, India and China have both engaged in extensive economic reforms, in effect bringing their joint population of some 2.3 billion into the worldwide system of capitalism and free trade. Those 2.3 billion people, many of whom are extremely well educated, are by and large willing to work harder and for less pay than are Americans. Are India and China's expanding and modernizing economies threatening America's long global dominance of science, technology, and industry? If so, what should we do about it?

In 1990 the United Nations forecast that world population would peak at around 11 billion by the middle of this century. Now many experts believe the peak will be closer to 8 or 9 billion people. Is this slowing of global population growth good news for the earth's environment? Or do we still need to worry about the dangers of overpopulation and overconsumption?</p>

There is no disputing the biological differences between men and women. But how do or should these biological differences influence the roles that men and women play in modern society? Are efforts to create equality in every venue of life--from sports, via programs such as Title IX, to the working world, via the pursuit of subsidized child care and maternity leave--ultimately beneficial for women or harmful?</p>

Proponents of embryonic stem cell research proclaim the potential of the research to find cures or treatments for many diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Opponents say the use and destruction of human embryos in the conduct of this research are immoral. In 2001, President Bush announced a ban on federal funding involving any new lines of embryonic stem cells. But calls to lift the ban continue, as do movements to increase funding at the state level. Which side of the debate is right? Is embryonic stem cell research ethical or not?</p>

Many experts believe that it is almost inevitable that terrorists will soon have the ability to detonate a nuclear weapon in the heart of a major American city. How can we stop them? What are the specific threats that we face and how should we respond to them? Do we face a greater danger from nuclear weapons that may have been stolen from the former Soviet Union or from the clandestine efforts of rogue nuclear scientists? And if the threat has increased since 9/11, why hasn't the United States done more to contain it?</p>

But with the Soviet Union gone and the European Union on the road to possible superpower status in its own right, does the transatlantic alliance have a future?</p>

The terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks took advantage of vulnerabilities in a critical part of America's infrastructure - our air transportation system. Experts have pointed to similar vulnerabilities in our nation's food supply, our ports, and our chemical and nuclear facilities. Congress and the Bush administration responded to the threat of other such attacks by creating the Department of Homeland Security. But has the government done enough? What more should we be doing to defend against potentially devastating domestic terrorist attacks? And just how much can we do without infringing on our freedom and way of life?</p>

In 2003, the secretary general of the United Nations appointed a 16-member commission to assess the threats to worldwide security in the twenty-first century. The commission came back with a number of recommendations for reforming the UN itself. Is this institution so important that it must be preserved and reformed? Or, given its lack of response to the crisis in Iraq, the ongoing nuclear crises in North Korea and Iran, and the humanitarian crisis in the Sudan, is the UN beyond reform? Perhaps it has outlasted its usefulness.</p>

                            <p>Jack Rakove, Coe professor of history and American studies, Stanford University, and Tara Ross, author, Enlightened Democracy: The Case for the Electoral College. As required by the Constitution, the president of the United States is elected not by the national popular vote but by the vote of the Electoral College. In the Electoral College, each state receives as many votes as it has members of Congress. Because every state has two senators and is guaranteed at least one House member, votes of small states count more heavily than votes of large states. Has the Electoral College served the nation well? Or should it be abolished and replaced by a system in which every vote counts the same?</p>

                            <p>In October 2004, the school board in the small town of Dover, Pennsylvania, ordered its high school biology teachers to preface classes on evolution with the statement: "Darwin's Theory is a theory not a fact. Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence." As an alternative to evolution, the school board suggested "intelligent design," a theory holding that life on earth could not have developed at random. Are there gaps in the theory of evolution that undermine its credibility? What should we make of "intelligent design"? And just what should we be teaching our children about the development of life on earth? Peter Robinson speaks with Massimo Pigliucci and Jonathan Wells.</p>

                            <p>In 2001, President Bush signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, a bipartisan effort to mandate national education standards and increase federal funding of education. At the time, critics on both sides of the political spectrum were troubled by the expansion of federal power over education that the act represented and by the education standards the act mandated. Now, nearly half a decade later, has No Child Left Behind been a success? If not, how should it be reformed? Peter Robinson speaks with John E. Chubb and Martin Carnoy.</p>

                            <p>During the 2004 presidential campaign, one principal plank of George W. Bush's domestic platform was reforming tort law, which includes class action lawsuits, asbestos liability, and medical malpractice liability. President Bush believes that tort law as it now stands permits trial lawyers to take advantage of good companies, driving up the costs of doing business for everyone. Others believe that existing tort law allows consumers to protect themselves against bad companies. Which is it? And should President Bush be given the tort reforms he wants?

Many couples are cohabiting without marriage, and many children are being raised in single-parent homes or other nontraditional family arrangements.

If so, why have marriage and family relationships changed so much over the past half-century? And what should the government do, if anything, to strengthen families and the institution of marriage?

                            <p>William H. Rehnquist has served as chief justice of the United States Supreme Court for nineteen years, the longest tenure of a chief justice in a century. How has the Rehnquist Court responded to the key constitutional issues of our times? What will be the philosophical legacy of the man himself? And who will miss him more, liberals or conservatives? Peter Robinson speaks with Kathleen Sullivan and John Yoo.</p>

                            <p>In 2002, the Bush administration published a new National Security Strategy, which argued that, in the twenty-first century, it was necessary for the United States not merely to defend itself but to use military force to prevent threats such as terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction. Is preventive force just? Is it effective? And what can the biggest example of this doctrine in action, the war in Iraq, tell us about the future of preventive force? Peter Robinson speaks with Victor Davis Hanson, Anne-Marie Slaughter, and Stephen Stedman.</p>

                            <p>Where should we draw the line between civil liberties and national security in the "war on terror"? Are we even at war, and if so, what are the constitutional limits to presidential war powers? Has the Bush administration gone too far in the electronic surveillance of citizens and the coercive interrogation of suspected terrorists and enemy combatants? Richard Epstein and John Yoo, both widely regarded as strict constitutional constructionists, take decidedly different positions on these questions.</p>

Now some-most notably New York congressman Charles Rangel, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee-have called for a reinstatement of the draft. Is this a good idea? What lessons from history can we call on to help answer this question? And what impact would the reinstatement of the draft have on society as a whole and the military in particular?

In all cases he demonstrates how economics relates to the social issues that deeply affect our country.</p>

                            <p>In his new book, Decline and Fall: Europe's Slow Motion Suicide, Bruce Thornton asserts that Europe has turned its back on the Western tradition to which it owes its greatness. It has abandoned pride in the nation, discarded traditional Christianity, and, in so doing, is without unifying values, ideals, and beliefs. But if Europe is still democratic, and if it still embraces the free market, why should anyone care that Judaeo-Christian religious beliefs are slipping away. The answer lies in the coinciding rise of radical Islam.</p>

                            <p>George Shultz, writing with Henry Kissinger and others in the Wall Street Journal late last year, asserted that "nuclear weapons were essential to maintaining international security during the Cold War. ...But reliance on nuclear weapons for [the purpose of deterrence] is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective,...The world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era." What made nuclear weapons acceptable then, and so unacceptable today? In answering these questions Shultz addresses the difficult challenges the United States faces as it seeks to curb the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, and the threat represented by non-nation state actors: the nightmare scenario of a nuclear suitcase bomb detonating in a major American city.</p>

In refuting them, Doug Feith offers a firsthand insight into the decision-making process at the Pentagon in the lead-up to the war and during its first few years. He also discusses the wars greatest blunders - failure to provide adequate security after Saddam's fall and the decision to maintain an occupation government in Iraq for over a year - as well as the tremendous shortcomings in pre-war intelligence. Finally, almost seven years after the September 11 attacks, he addresses whether the United States government is changing fast enough to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century security environment.</p>

                            <p>Professor Philip Bobbitt describes the "wars for the 21st century" as wars against terror - against modern market-state terrorism, against the distribution and assimilation of weapons of mass destruction, and against the forces that create human catastrophes, such as genocide and ethnic cleansing. During the 20th century it was important that the law and the allied war strategy were separate. According to Bobbitt, "We won the war and then the law followed." In the current century, however, Bobbitt says, our challenge is to unite the two: law and war strategy must meet because we are now fighting to protect what free people have the lawful right to do. But how do we strengthen the power of government to protect us and at the same time protect civil and human rights?</p>

Confronting Islamic extremism, how do we make our strategic behavior -- the rules of war - conform to the rule of law that is essential in maintaining a free society?</p>

                            <p>Victor Davis Hanson and Christopher Hitchens take on the World War II revisionists, focusing first on Patrick J. Buchanan, the author, most recently, of Churchill, Hitler, and the Unnecessary War. They counter the essential claims in Buchanan's book that Britain's guarantee to protect Poland in the event of a German invasion made the war inevitable; that the Holocaust was a consequence of the war and that, without it, the Holocaust may not have occurred; and that Germany invaded Russia only because Britain under Churchill was determined to partner with Russia against Germany. Finally they address two claims made by author Niall Ferguson that "[the Allies] adopted the most brutal tactics of those they were fighting" and that the principal beneficiary of the Second World War was Stalin's Soviet Union.</p>

                            <p>Should we care what the founders would say about modern-day America? Richard Brookhiser says yes. If so, how should we consider some of our thornier contemporary issues in light of what the founders thought, such as "originalism" in constitutional matters, America as a "religious" nation if not a Christian nation, or even the fundamental principles of U.S. foreign policy? Even the bruising political battles currently being waged in Washington may be better understood in the context of the political wars our founders fought when the Republic was born.</p>

                            <p>Amity Shlaes challenges the received wisdom that the Great Depression occurred because capitalism broke and that it ended because FDR, and government in general, came to the rescue. According to Shlaes, it was the government that made the Great Depression worse. And was FDR's progressivism, as evident in the New Deal, really all that new, or was it a step along a progressive continuum that already had been established?</p>

Archbishop Chaput weighs into this battle, taking on the thorny issue of where to draw the line between church and state, particularly for Catholics. The archbishop also answers critics who speak of misbegotten forays by the church into other political battles as well as the challenges the Catholic Church faces as its influence declines in American life.</p>

                            <p>In 1995 Connerly campaigned for Proposition 209, which would make it illegal for the state of California to discriminate on the basis of race, intending to end the state's affirmative action programs. The proposition passed. Since then, Connerly, having won passage of such measures in Washington State and Michigan, has continued the fight. In discussing the battle to end racial preferences, Connerly notes that "the establishment is always at odds with the people on issues involving race." Martin Luther King, says Connerly, would likely have supported affirmative action back in the 1960s, but were he alive today, he'd say, "We're beyond that now." Would a President Obama agree? Connerly weighs in.</p>

                            <p>Sowell describes the critical differences between interests and visions. Interests, he says, are articulated by people who know what their interests are and what they want to do about them. Visions, however, are the implicit assumptions by which people operate. In politics, visions are either "constrained" or "unconstrained." A closer look at the statements of both McCain and Obama reveals which "vision" motivates their policy positions, particularly as they pertain to the war, the law, and economics.</p>

J. Servan-Schreiber. In explaining what's wrong with the U.S. economy, Thiel points out that, although we have benefited from growth that is both extensive (e.g., free trade) and intensive (e.g., technology), we have not featured enough of each. He asserts that the credit crisis of 2008 has nothing to do with the failings of the free market but rather is a by-product of government entanglement, nurtured by the motors of economic growth working less well than expected.</p>

Economist John Taylor discusses today's financial crisis, which he labels the most "unusual" crisis since the Great Depression. He identifies a number of factors contributing to the crisis, but locates its origins in the monetary excesses of the Fed. In outlining what the government should and should not do in response to the crisis, he concludes that it will be tragic if we forget all we have learned over the past two and a half decades about the importance of the private sector and the free market.</p>

Bolton sees a power shift in the Middle East that would be fundamental, calamitous, and irreversible should Iran get nuclear weapons.</p>

                            <p>The Constitution "is not living, but dead." With these words Associate Justice Scalia sums up how he believes we should think about the Constitution - a way of thinking that underpins the theory of "originalism" which guides his approach to cases that come before the Supreme Court. In expounding on originalism, Scalia takes the Court to task on past decisions, including Roe v. Wade, and measures just how far the Court can and should go in reversing these mistakes.</p>

                            <p>During his thirty-seven years in the U.S. Army, Jack Keane earned four stars. Beginning his career as a paratrooper in Vietnam, he rose to command both the 101st Airborne Division and the 18th Airborne Corps. In his final post he served as the Army's vice chief of staff. General Keane retired from active duty in 2003. In 2006, General Keane and military historian Frederick Kagan helped develop a new approach to the Iraq war that would become known as "the surge." How did we arrive at that point in 2006 when the entire war effort in Iraq hung in the balance - why did the war go so badly for so long? General Keane gives an insider's account of this pivotal time in the Iraq war and of the resistance encountered within the military to that dramatic change in strategy. Keane discusses the lessons to be learned from the Iraq War and how to define and achieve victory in Afghanistan. Finally, he deals with the overall question of the military force structure and the danger of becoming preoccupied with the threat of terrorism and insurgencies and thus risking being unable to confront a conventional power.</p>

Echoing parallels with the United States, he offers his views on multiculturalism-which he calls "a very confused credo"-and Australia's role in the "Anglosphere," particularly as it relates to China, its largest and most powerful Asian neighbor. He speaks of the current financial crisis and the need to remain confident in the market and the dangers of overregulation.

Finally, he offers his insights into the deep structure of environmentalism that substitutes a human apocalypse for a religious one.</p>

It is a project, he asserts, that has expressed itself in three distinct waves: political liberalism, economic liberalism, and cultural liberalism.

Finally, he confronts the issues of how conservatism lost its way in the face of the liberal project and how it might regain its initiative.</p>

Moyo asserts, however, that this assistance has made African people no better off. "Africa's real per capita income today is lower than in the 1970s, with over half of the 700 million Africans living on less than a dollar a day." Eschewing the "glamour aid" of celebrities such as Bob Geldof and Bono, she argues that the key to transforming African countries is to make them less reliant on foreign aid and compel them to "enforce rules of prudence and not live beyond their means."</p>

                            <p>Thomas Sowell analyzes the recent housing boom and bust, beginning with the underlying economic causes that artificially inflated housing costs in certain markets. He points the finger directly at political decisions in Washington - particularly involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - that enabled and promoted the financing of an unsustainable housing bubble in which the collapse of prices in a few inflated markets rapidly evolved into a national crisis. Sowell challenges the accepted wisdom of modeling a recovery based on the New Deal, which he asserts did little to help - and perhaps even extended - The Great Depression. Finally, he disputes the value of the recent stimulus package and argues against Obama's health-care and energy initiatives.</p>

Jaffa explains that the Lincoln-Douglas debates centered on the "question of whether the people make the moral law or the moral law makes the people." At the core of Lincoln's political philosophy, Jaffa argues, was the proposition from the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal." And it is this proposition that gives Americans alone, Jaffa says, a legitimate claim to a belief that their country is truly exceptional.</p>

But is that so? In answering this question and others about Trotsky's ideas, political defeat, and exile, Hitchens and Service speak to the very nature of communist ideology.</p>

                            <p>In a previous Uncommon Knowledge interview, Jaffa discussed his classic Crisis of the House Divided. In this interview, Jaffa returns to discuss the sequel, A New Birth of Freedom. He begins by making a critical point: whereas the Founders had expected slavery simply to wither away, by the middle of the nineteenth century the peculiar institution had done no such thing. The Civil War, Jaffa insists, was a necessary war-an unavoidable war-not a war of choice. When the war broke out, anyone who had engaged in a cool calculation of the odds would have put his money on the Confederacy, not the Union. Commenting on contemporary America, Jaffa points out the distinction between the "immutable principles of private morality" that President Washington spoke of and the "fundamental American values" that President Obama speaks of today. "Values are moral choices, which have no object or basis," Jaffa asserts. "The value is a subjective desire, not an objective truth. A hundred years ago, nobody would have spoken about our principles as being values."</p>

In foreign affairs, he presents Reagan as possessing unique insights into issues that had confounded the policy establishment for decades and as willing to battle not only with the Democratic opposition but also with the conventional reflexes of much of his own party and staff. Against prevailing opinion, Hayward defends his proposition that Reagan's domestic record is commensurate with his foreign achievements: "One person saved the Reagan Revolution from retreat and rout. That person was Ronald Reagan." Finally, Hayward argues that, "if Reagan failed in a permanent alignment the way Roosevelt did with the New Deal, it was because the Republican Party, its successors, and even Reagan himself were not a full-fledged constitutional movement."

                            <p>In Parker v. the District of Columbia, Judge Silberman wrote the 2007 opinion striking down parts of the District of Columbia's ban on handguns as unconstitutional. Here he explains how his thinking about the Second Amendment evolved "When the case first came to me, I had been under the impression...that the Second Amendment [the right to bear arms] was a collective right. When I looked into it, I concluded to the contrary." Silberman further advances the "theory of originalism" and defends the positions he staked out 30 years ago when he published a famous essay titled "Will Lawyering Strangle Democratic Capitalism?" Finally, as one of the principals of the Robb/Silberman Commission, he takes on the assertion that "Bush lied, people died," labeling it "an absurd and outrageous libel."</p>

                            <p>Brady and Kessler combine the insights of a political scientist with those of an economist and offer unique observations into the political forces and policies at play in the current health care debate. Brady and Kessler compare the politics of Clintoncare in 1993 to the politics of Obamacare today. If President Clinton couldn't push through sweeping health care reform in 1993 why does President Obama think he can in 2009? Has public opinion or the health care system changed? Has the health care system itself changed? And what exactly is the substance of the president's plan and will Congress give him what he wants?</p>

                            <p>Does Iran possess the ability to produce nuclear weapons? Both Bob Baer and Victor Hanson agree that it does. On the questions that flow from this assertion, agreement is more difficult to find. What does Iran hope to accomplish by developing the bomb? Can the United States live with a nuclear Iran-can Israel? Israeli defense minister Ephraim Sneh in an October interview asserted that "if no crippling sanctions are in place by Christmas, Israel will strike....If we are left alone, we will act alone." Does Israel possess the ability to destroy the Iranian nuclear program? With each month bringing another deception and diversion from Iran, what can the United States do to prevent a conflagration in the Middle East?</p>

                            <p>In retelling his experience of living through the Velvet Revolution, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the lifting of the Iron Curtain, Czech Republic president VÃ¿clav Klaus offers his views on what students today need to understand about life under communism. He also defends his opposition to the idea of a European superstate-"I do not consider the Lisbon Treaty to be a good thing for Europe, for the freedom of Europe, or for the Czech Republic"-and compares the ideology of environmentalism and global warming alarmism with the ideology of communism. Finally, he ponders the question of what lessons from history his grandchildren are learning.</p>

He further speaks of the intersection of the universal themes of mythology and Christianity and Christianity's future. "History...is a test of mankind," says Rene Girard, and "mankind is failing that test."</p>
