            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>A prominent specialist in the field of cooperative economic theory, I. V. Emel'ianov was born at Uspenskii zavod, Tobol'skaia guberniia, on 1 November 1880 (O. S.). In 1900, he graduated from Tobol'sk seminary, but decided to continue his education in the field of agronomy. In 1907 he graduated from Kiev Polytechnic Institute with a degree in that subject, proceeding to work as an agronomist for local zemstvo organizations. From 1910 to 1912 he served as agricultural agent for the Ekaterinoslavskoe zemstvo in the United States. Following his return to Russia, most of his career was spent in various capacities in the Khar'kov region, where he worked closely with cooperative organizations.</p>
            <p>In 1917, he was elected a member of the Khar'kov gubernskaia zemskaia uprava and Chairman of the Board of the Khar'kov Zemstvo Bureau of Small Credit. In September 1919 under the White regime he was appointed chairman of the Khar'kov gubernskaia zemskaia uprava. The same year, he became an officer of the Selosoyus cooperative and Moscow Narodny Bank. Arriving in Prague in 1921, he proceeded to help found the Russkii institut sel'sko-khoziaistvennoi kooperatsii (of which he was deputy director until 1927) and established the journals Zemledelie and Khutor, which he edited.</p>
            <p>Emigrating to the United States at the invitation of Rutgers University, he taught there until 1933, thereafter working for various government agencies as an economist. His Ph. D. thesis at Columbia, Economic Theory of Cooperation was completed in 1942, only some three years before his death in Washington, D.C. on 17 December 1945.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>This collection contains the papers of the noted theoretician of cooperative economics, Ivan V. Emel'ianov. Most of the collection consists of his writings on cooperative issues and correspondence relating to his scholarly and social activities while in Czechoslovakia (1921-1927) and the United States (1927-1945). Special mention should be made of the correspondence and research material for his dissertation, subsequently published as 
                <title render="italic">The Economic Theory of Cooperation</title>. Correspondence and subject file material also illustrate his involvement in Russian émigré organizations of an educational and social character in both countries. There is also a set of documents pertaining to his activities during the Russian Civil War, when he represented cooperative organizations in Europe.</p>
            <p>Many of Emel'ianov's publications are printed copies that include the entire issue of the periodicals they appeared in, which are very often themselves bibliographic rarities. A printed matter series, which includes a significant number of rare publications on cooperative issues by other authors, supplements Emel'ianov's own work in this field.</p>
            <p>His wife, Nataliia Emel'ianova, was a chemist by profession, and the collection contains a number of her scientific publications, as well as biographical information and correspondence detailing her involvement in émigré life.</p>
            <p>Detailed processing and preservation microfilming for these materials were made possible by a generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and by matching funds from the Hoover Institution and Museum of Russian Culture. The grant also provides depositing a microfilm copy in the Hoover Institution Archives. The original materials and copyright to them (with some exceptions) are the property of the Museum of Russian Culture, San Francisco. A transfer table indicating corresponding box and reel numbers is available at the Hoover Institution Archives.</p>
