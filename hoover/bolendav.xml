            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Acquired in 2003, the David B. Bolen collection in the Hoover Institution Archives documents the long and distinguished career of an American diplomat whose service included ambassadorships in southern Africa and East Germany. The collection consists primarily of official correspondence and reports relating to these and other postings in Bolen's diplomatic career; it also includes materials pertaining to his subsequent work for the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.</p>
            <p>The collection has significant materials relating to bilateral diplomacy between the United States and the German Democratic Republic, and to East-West relations in general during the Carter administration, including tensions arising from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. There are reports and official correspondence concerning Bolen's conduct of negotiations leading to a consular agreement between the U.S. and GDR, and numerous documents regarding disputes and incidents stemming from the divided status of Berlin during the latter part of the Cold War. The collection also has extensive materials pertaining to internal developments within the GDR, including the East German government's treatment of dissident artists and writers.</p>
            <p>Expanding American exports to East Germany was a high priority of Bolen's ambassadorship, and economic issues figure prominently in the collection as a whole. In particular, there are accounts of American participation in trade fairs in Leipzig. There are also photographs and other materials relating to Bolen's meetings with East German leaders on such occasions, including the head of state, Erich Honecker.</p>
            <p>The Bolen collection is equally rich in documentation on political and economic affairs in southern Africa during the 1970s and 1980s. The collection includes correspondence and reports from Bolen's tenure as United States Ambassador to Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, and extensive materials relating to South Africa from Bolen's career with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. The collection has extensive correspondence and reports on the implementation of the Sullivan principles by foreign companies doing business in South Africa, and on opposition inside that country, and internationally, to the apartheid system.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains a selection of speeches and remarks made by Ambassador Bolen over the course of his diplomatic and business careers, most of which deal with African and East German issues. There are also biographical materials, including accounts of Bolen's early prominence as an Olympic athlete. Throughout the collection are interspersed documents that record Bolen's own thoughts on American foreign policy, as well as his views on civil rights and his experiences as a prominent African-American official in the diplomatic service of the United States.</p>
            <p>As far as possible, the original arrangement of the collection, as established by Ambassador Bolen, has been preserved.</p>
